UPDATE 1-Dairy Crest loses a third of Morrisons milk contract,Morrisons,-0.161,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-dairy-crest-contract-idUKKBN0KT0IT20150120,www.reuters.com,Dairy Crest loses a third of Morrisons milk contract,"(Reuters) - Dairy Crest Group Plc DCG.L lost a third of its fresh milk supply contract with WM Morrison Supermarkets Plc MRW.L, Britain's No. 4 grocer, even as it exits its money-losing milk business.
Dairy Crest is in the midst of selling its dairies operations to a unit of German food group Müller as it battles low milk prices and shifts its focus to cheese and spreads.
“... If they sell the business, then it’s irrelevant for future profit. What’s happening now will be Müller’s problem,” analyst Nicola Mallard of Investec Securities told Reuters.
Dairy Crest, the owner of Cathedral City cheese and Country Life butter, said on Tuesday it secured a three-year extension from Morrisons to provide fresh milk, but supply would be reduced by about a third from March.
The company added that it did not expect the lower volumes to materially affect results for its fiscal year ending March 31.
Peel Hunt analyst Charles Hall said the lost business equalled about 70 million litres, or 10 percent, of Dairy Crest’s supply to retailers.
“The normal rule of thumb is that volume reduction in liquid milk impacts by (about) 5 pence per litre, which would equate to 3.5 million pounds impact on profits in a full year. This may be on the high side as the Morrisons’ contract was already highly competitive on price,” Hall wrote in a note.
Dairy farmers across the UK have been under pressure due to a glut in domestic milk supply, which has resulted in average UK farmgate milk price dropping every month since February 2014.
Dairy Crest cut prices by 1.2 pence per litre late December for farmers on its standard liquid and Davidstow contracts from Feb. 1. Scotland-based dairy cooperative First Milk also cut prices by 2.43 pence per litre earlier this month.
British lawmakers have also called for better protection for dairy farmers from the decline in milk prices.
Dairy Crest buys milk from around 1,100 dairy farmers and also delivers to supermarkets run by Waitrose, J. Sainsbury SBRY.L and Marks & Spencer MKS.L.
The Esher, Surrey-based company has been trying to increase profits by cutting distribution costs, improving its branding and selling property.
Dairy Crest shares were up marginally at 471.3 pence at 1023 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

UPDATE 1-Pearson expects to grow this year after solid end to 2014,Pearson,0.446,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-pearson-results-idUKKBN0KU0JJ20150121,www.reuters.com,Pearson expects to return to growth this year,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pearson PSON.L said it expected to return to earnings growth in 2015, after a solid performance its North American higher education unit helped bring an end to a turbulent two years of restructuring and profit downgrades.
The education and media group said for 2015 it expected adjusted earnings per share to come in between 75 and 80 pence, up from the 66 pence it expects for last year, in what would be the first rise since 2011.
The 66 pence figure for 2014 was at the top of a range Pearson had previously given of 62 to 67 pence, and was higher than a current consensus forecast of 64 pence per share.
Pearson's stock rose three percent to 1,273 pence at 0850 GMT, making the company the biggest gainer on Britain's bluechip index .FTSE.
“A solid update, both from the perspective of the full-year 2014 number and the early full-year 2015 guide,” Jefferies analysts said. “We would expect modest upgrades to follow.”
Having expanded rapidly, the 171-year-old company, a world leader in education, spent 2013 and 2014 restructuring to increase its focus on the faster growth areas of digital services and emerging markets to complement its core U.S. education division.
The process, which coincided with a raft of management changes, has taken its toll, with associated costs coming in higher than expected and the firm’s shares still to recover from an earnings downgrade at the beginning of 2014.
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said it had faced tough market conditions throughout 2014, due to pressures on budgets in North America and Britain, its two largest markets, and weaker demand for textbooks in South Africa.
“Despite continuing challenging market conditions, overall we had a good competitive performance in 2014,” Chief Executive John Fallon said in a trading statement.
“We enter 2015 a simpler, leaner, more cash generative business, well set for long-term growth and success, helping more people around the world make progress in their lives through learning.”
It benefited from strong performances in its online services, its English language learning business in China and by improving the profitability of the FT Group.
Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said while the 2015 guidance looked good, he noted that the figures were boosted by foreign exchange rates and a lower than expected tax rate.

"FDA approves NPS drug, in move validating Shire takeover deal",Shire,0.332,https://www.reuters.com/article/fda-nps-pharma-approval-idUKL1N0V21P820150124,www.reuters.com,"FDA approves NPS drug, in move validating Shire takeover deal","Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s drug Natpara to treat a rare hormone disorder, validating a bet by Shire Plc , which recently agreed to acquire NPS for $5.2 billion.
Natpara is designed to treat hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which the body’s parathyroid gland does not secrete enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). The hormone works with vitamin D to regulate body calcium.
Analysts expect the drug to generate peak annual sales of $542 million by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Shire, which makes Adderall and Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is seeking to expand its position in the field of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders and rare diseases.
About 180,000 people globally suffer from hypoparathyroidism, according to New Jersey-based NPS. In about 40 percent of cases, the condition cannot be controlled with the current treatment of high doses of calcium and vitamin D.
That uncontrolled population is the audience that NPS initially plans to target, which in the United States is about 20,000 patients, the company said.
Low levels of PTH can cause tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle spasms, fatigue, muscle aches, hair loss, dry skin, headaches, mood swings and memory problems.
Natpara is a bioengineered version of the hormone itself.
The condition can be caused by congenital disorders or surgery.
NPS also sells a drug for short-bowel syndrome, Gattex, which analysts on average expect to have peak sales of $526 million by 2019.
Data from a late-stage clinical trial of Natpara showed that 53 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to reduce their calcium and vitamin D supplements by 50 percent or more, compared with 2 percent of placebo-treated patients.
By the 24th week, 43 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to stop vitamin D therapy and required 500 mg a day or less of calcium, compared with only 5 percent of patients treated with placebo.
The drug was approved in Europe in 2006 to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at high risk for fractures, under the trade name Preotact.
But European regulators noted that studies in rats indicated an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term use and said that until further clinical data became available treatment should not be continued beyond 24 months.
The FDA declined to approve the drug for osteoporosis.
NPS withdrew Preotact from the market last year. NPS has filed for approval of Natpara in Europe. (Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler)

Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs,Shire,0.235,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nps-m-a-shire-idUKKBN0KK0QE20150111,www.reuters.com,Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire Plc has agreed to buy NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion in its biggest acquisition yet, as the Dublin-based drugmaker strengthens its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases.
The takeover continues the breakneck pace of deal-making in 2014 in the pharmaceuticals sector, as companies jockey for promising assets amid a wave of new drugs emerging from research laboratories.
Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told Reuters he would keep looking for more deals to grow the company into a biotech powerhouse.
Shire will pay $46.00 per NPS share, representing a premium of nearly 10 percent to NPS’ Friday close, the two companies said on Sunday.
The move will not come as a huge surprise, since Shire was first linked to NPS in May 2014. When plans for Shire to sell itself to AbbVie Inc fell apart in October, Shire said it could look again at earlier deal prospects and reports of Shire’s interest resurfaced in mid-December.
“This is about growth and rare diseases, and it fits hand in glove with our strategy and our franchise,” Ornskov said.
Shire expects the all-cash deal to add to its adjusted earnings from 2016 onward. It believes it can achieve cost savings of approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of consensus forecasts for NPS’ standalone future operating cost base from 2017.
The acquisition of New Jersey-based NPS will give Shire two significant new drugs. Gattex, a treatment for short-bowel syndrome, is already on the market, while Natpara, for hypoparathyroidism, is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA is slated to decide on the Natpara application by Jan. 24. “I am confident that Natpara will be approved on the 24th, however ... there is absolutely no guarantee,” said NPS CEO Francois Nader. “Given our interactions with the FDA, I believe it will be approved.”
Nader called Shire’s decision to conclude a deal before a decision “a calculated risk on their part,” that nevertheless “would provide the joint company the opportunity to deploy the most resources in supporting the launch.”
Consensus analyst forecasts for the two NPS medicines point to annual sales of $509 million and $534 million respectively by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, although Ornskov believes they may bring in more.
“Both of them have significant sales potential and some have mentioned the word ‘blockbuster’,” he said. The term blockbuster applies to a drug with sales of $1 billion or more.
“ALWAYS CONSIDERING NEXT DEAL”
Shire, which will tender NPS shares, has secured an $850 million bank loan which, together with cash reserves and an existing $2.1 billion five-year revolving credit facility, will pay for the deal.
Even though NPS is a record acquisition for Shire, Ornskov expects the deal, which could close in the first quarter of this year, to be paid off quickly.
“We are incredibly cash-generative and this will add to that, so this does not prevent us from considering further deals,” he said. “Shire is always considering the next deal.”
Shire’s coffers were boosted to the tune of more than $1.6 billion when it got a windfall break-up fee after AbbVie walked away from its $55 billion takeover bid.
Citigroup and Lazard acted as joint financial advisers to Shire, with Goldman Sachs and Leerink advising NPS.

* Floats 56.5% of business on London exchange
* Shares jump as much as 23% on market debut
* IPO bucks trend for recent lacklustre listings (Updates with details, share price rise)
By Clara Denina
LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Britain’s Trainline bucked a trend of lacklustre European initial public offerings (IPOs) on Friday, as the rail ticketing group’s shares jumped as much as 23% on its London market debut.
The British firm, which sells rail and coach tickets online, floated 56.5% of its business on the London Stock Exchange, valuing it at 1.68 billion pounds ($2.13 billion).
Trainline’s shares, which were priced at 350 pence, opened at 400 pence and quickly climbed to a high of 431 pence. They were trading up 20% at 420 pence by 0720 GMT.
Founded more than 20 years ago, Trainline sells tickets from 220 rail and coach carriers across 45 European and Asian countries on its website and mobile app, generating net ticket sales of 3.2 billion pounds in the fiscal year 2019.
The pricing at the top of Trainline’s targeted range marks a bright spot for London IPOs, which have seen a slow start to the year as uncertainty around Britain’s departure from the European Union has stirred market turbulence.
Despite an improvement in proceeds from European listings over the past two months, compared to a 10-year low of $292 million in the first quarter, recently-listed companies including Finablr and Watches of Switzerland are still trading below their flotation price.
Finablr had to slash its IPO price, blaming jittery markets and weak investor demand.
The company said it will use the proceeds of the IPO, in which fund manager Baillie Gifford has committed to invest 200 million pounds, to raise its profile and tap into growing demand for e-ticketed travel across Europe.
Trainline opted to push on with the IPO despite sources saying private equity firms had expressed interest in buying it.
A previously planned London IPO in 2015 was derailed when U.S. private equity fund KKR bought it for an undisclosed value that sources then put at more than 500 million pounds. ($1 = 0.7883 pounds) (Reporting by Clara Denina Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Alexander Smith)

Breakingviews: IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus,IAG,0.12,https://www.reuters.com/article/aer-lingus-group-ma-iag-breakingviews-idUSL1N0UR13P20150112,www.reuters.com,Breakingviews: IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) can pay more than the 1.3 billion euros it is dangling before Irish rival Aer Lingus. The proposed price barely covers the value of the Dublin-based airline’s fleet, its slots at London Heathrow airport and its net cash. IAG cannot expect to get a decent operating business thrown in for free.
On one view, the improved proposal of 2.4 euros per share - 10 cents more than IAG’s first proposal in mid-December - appears good enough. It’s a 32 percent markup on the target’s share price on the day before the possibility of a bid became public, and an even higher premium to the average share price over the three months before.
But Aer Lingus’ recent market value is not the best benchmark for assessing the take-out price. It is affected by a dispute between main shareholder Ryanair and regulators who want the low-cost carrier to reduce its 29.9 percent stake to below 5 percent. The uncertainty over the when and how of Ryanair’s potential exit weighed on Aer Lingus’ stock. Moreover, the Irish government’s 25.1 percent stake means the free-float is thin and trading illiquid.
A higher premium can be justified on fundamentals. Aer Lingus’ fleet of Airbus aircraft have a book value of 660 million euros. The carrier holds 23 daily starting and landing rights at London Heathrow, British Airway’s main hub, which have an estimated market value of 250 million pounds (320 million euros), based on Breakingviews calculations.
Factor in about 400 million euros of net cash, and the carrier’s inherent value stands at about 1.4 billion euros. Its profitable and growing operations deserve a further markup. The Dublin-based airline boasts strong growth in transatlantic flights, has a lean cost base and eked out an average operating margin of 3.9 percent over the last decade. HSBC analysts expect the margin to rise to 6.8 percent by 2015.
For IAG, the deal is a good strategic fit and a hedge against further delays of Heathrow expansion. Aer Lingus’ board is showing some welcome resolve in rejecting the proposals so far. It can hold out for something between 2.5 euros and three euros a share.
- International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, said on Jan. 9 that Aer Lingus had rejected a revised all-cash takeover proposal that valued the Irish airline at 2.4 euros per share or 1.3 billion euros.
- “There can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming,” IAG said.
- IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, made a 2.3 euros-a-share proposal in December.
- Aer Lingus shares fell about 5 percent to 2.37 euros in early European trading on Jan. 12.

CRH's concrete bid for Holcim Lafarge assets,Holcim Lafarge,0.282,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lafarge-holcim-assets-idUSKBN0L51QF20150202,www.reuters.com,"Ireland's CRH to buy Lafarge, Holcim assets for $7.4 billion","DUBLIN (Reuters) - CRH has agreed to pay 6.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion) for assets from rivals Lafarge and Holcim, in a deal that will transform the Irish company into the world’s third-biggest building materials supplier.
Shares in CRH rose as much as 7 percent on Monday as investors welcomed a move that will expand the company’s global reach, making it the largest building supplier in central and eastern Europe and doubling its presence in emerging markets.
However, some analysts said it was paying a high price for assets Lafarge and Holcim have to sell to win regulatory approval for their planned merger, and that the deal was a big bet on construction markets in a faltering global economy.
“We think they’ve overpaid,” said Merrion Stockbrokers’ David Holohan, pointing to press reports the price for the assets rose 500 million euros in the last week of the auction.
“With two-thirds of the assets in Europe, the deal is going to be dependent on benefiting from any increase in construction activity in Europe,” he added, cutting his recommendation on CRH shares to “sell” from “hold”.
Data last week showed confidence in the euro zone’s construction sector declined in January amid fears of deflation and stagnating economies.
Lafarge and Holcim announced merger plans last year, hoping to cut costs, tackle overcapacity and weak demand by creating the world’s biggest cement maker. The firms said the sale to CRH put their tie-up on track to complete in the first half of 2015.
For CRH, the deal follows a breakneck expansion in the years before the financial crisis that CEO Albert Manifold brought to a halt just over a year ago by putting 2 billion euros -- or 20 percent of net assets -- up for sale.
Manifold said CRH had made some bad deals in the past by buying into market trends, but this time was different because the assets fitted well with CRH’s existing operations.
“This is just one that’s too good to turn down,” he told journalists, arguing the U.S. economy was starting to recover and the worst was behind for Europe.
“What this really does is it creates an opportunity for a whole new wave of acquisitions for the next decade.”
Shares in CRH, whose cement operations represented just 15 percent of earnings before Monday’s deal, were up 5.4 percent to 1,690 pence by 1220 GMT. Holcim’s shares rose 1.7 percent, while Lafarge’s were 0.5 percent higher.
CRH beat a consortium led by Blackstone for the assets, according to people familiar with the matter.
Analysts said the deal gave the assets an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of 8.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), or 7.7 times when adjusted for the savings CRH expects to achieve.
That compares with multiples of more than 10 times paid by Heidelberg in its $16 billion takeover of Hanson and in Cemex’s deal with Rinker, both around the height of the boom.
CRH said the assets, which will add 15,000 employees across 11 countries to its current workforce of 76,000, would boost underlying earnings by about 25 percent in the first full year of ownership if the deal completes by mid-2015.
Around 90 million euros of synergies -- net of implementation costs -- would also be achieved in the first three years post-acquisition, it added.
CRH will fund the purchase with 2 billion euros of cash, new debt and a 9.99 percent equity placing, representing 1.58 billion euros of issued share capital.
The company, which had a net debt of around 2.5 billion euros or 1.5 times earnings at the end of 2014, expects this to rise to 3.2 times earning on the back of the deal, before falling again thanks to its own disposal plan.

Ruling sets lower limit on potential fine for BP,BP,-0.261,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bp-trial-idUKKBN0KT11V20150121,www.reuters.com,BP asks for lower fine in penalty phase of Gulf spill trial,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - BP Plc, citing low oil prices, tried to whittle away at $13.7 billion (9 billion pounds) in potential fines under the Clean Water Act on Tuesday as the penalty phase started in its trial over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
BP said its fine should be modest as it took extensive steps to mitigate the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history and that the defendant named in the case, BP’s exploration and production unit, known as BPXP, cannot afford a big penalty.
“There has been no collapse of the ecosystem,” BP lawyer Mike Brock said in opening statements, contending that the Gulf has been more resilient than thought. Environmental groups say it could take decades for the Gulf to recover.
Brock said the penalties should take into account BPXP’s ability to pay, and not be tied to the balance sheet of its parent company.
He said a 60 percent drop in oil prices since June has slashed BPXP’s value to about $5.1 billion, down from $16 billion just months ago.
The government knows that “BPXP cannot afford a penalty in the range that they are asking for, and so that’s why they are saying look to the parent,” Brock said.
Steve O’Rourke, the government’s lawyer, said BPXP and BP are effectively the same company. He urged a fine of $11.7 to $13.7 billion.
“BP’s litigation position in this phase suggests that it still doesn’t understand the gravity of what’s happened here, they continue to focus on their own hardships rather than the hardships of the environment and the people,” O’Rourke said.
U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier asked during Brock’s opening statements whether the parties believed the penalties could be paid over a period of years given the current state of BPXP’s finances.
Brock said he was not sure, while O’Rourke said such precedent exists.
Clean Water Act rules say when assigning penalties the court must look at BP’s ability to pay, steps it took to clean up the spill, and its history of past violations.
In 2012, one person was killed and two were injured at a BP natural gas plant in Colorado. The Macondo blowout in 2010 killed 11 men on Transocean Ltd’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.
In 2005, 15 died in an explosion at BP’s Texas City refinery, which the company later sold. In 2006, oil spilled from a BP-operated pipeline in Alaska. And in 2005, BP’s Thunder Horse oil and gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico nearly sank because of a design flaw, postponing its startup by three years.
The Clean Water Act penalties would come on top of more than $42 billion the oil major has set aside for cleanup, compensation and fines. About 810,000 barrels were collected during cleanup.
Several billion dollars in potential fines were avoided on Thursday when Barbier put the size of the spill at 3.19 million barrels. That was well below the government’s estimate of 4.09 million barrels, which could have led to $17.6 billion in fines.
The first two phases of the trial, over the degree of negligence and the spill’s size, have concluded. The penalty phase is expected to last three weeks.
Under a “gross negligence” ruling Barbier issued in September, BP could be fined a statutory limit of $4,300 for each barrel spilled, though he has authority to set lower penalties.
BP has also filed motions saying the maximum fine per barrel is in fact just $3,000 because Congress never passed laws to adjust it for inflation.
A simple “negligence” ruling, which BP sought, caps the maximum fine at $1,100 per barrel.

By Sarah Young
LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - British aircraft parts supplier Meggitt Plc said it was on course to meet its guidance for the year after ironing out production problems in the United States, and it lifted its dividend as a sign of confidence in future growth.
The FTSE 100 company, which has a stock market value of about 4 billion pounds ($6.7 billion), reiterated guidance for mid-single digit organic or self-generated revenue growth this year, adding it was on course to deliver at the 6 to 7 percent level on average over the medium term.
The reassurance on 2014’s outlook, coming after a revenue downgrade last November, buoyed its shares which traded up 2.7 percent at 507.75 pence by 0903 GMT, making it one of Britain’s top blue chip risers. The stock had fallen in the previous session to its lowest since mid December.
“This is a bit of relief that the numbers are in line and that the guidance is intact,” Societe General analyst Zafar Khan said.
Meggitt’s stock had fallen 12 percent since Nov. 1, when it warned revenue would grow by a low single-digit percent amount, down from a previous forecast for mid-single digit growth. It blamed a supply issue with a raw material in the United States as it consolidated two factories, plus currency headwinds due to the strength of the pound against the dollar.
“They (the issues) are either sorted or there’s a plan that we’re working through and they’ll be sorted soon,” Chief Executive Stephen Young said in an interview on Tuesday.
Meggitt, which supplies flight displays and wheels to planemakers Airbus and Boeing, reported a 3 percent rise in 2013 underlying pretax profit to 377.8 million pounds, in line with forecasts, and said it would hike its full-year dividend 8 percent
“What it says is we’re confident with our 6 to 7 percent revenue growth forecast in the medium term,” Young said. The final dividend of 8.8p per share takes the yearly total to 12.75p.
Adverse currency movements could impact Meggitt’s profitability this year, however, Young warned, adding that he expected analysts to adjust their 2014 forecasts to account for those headwinds.
Growth this year would be driven by a recovery in the market for aircraft spares, Young predicted, noting customers had been destocking in recent years but the company was now seeing the beginning of restocking.
Meggitt’s energy business which accounts for about 10 percent of its total sales would also drive growth this year, Young forecast.
Demand from oil and gas customers for valves, sensors and heat exchange units produced by Meggitt was expected to rise 10 percent or more this year, Young said. ($1 = 0.5982 British Pounds) (Editing by James Davey and David Holmes)

Slump in Weir leads FTSE down from record high,Weir,-0.827,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-markets-stocks-ftse-idUKKBN0LT0TI20150225,www.reuters.com,Slump in Weir leads FTSE down from record high,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index retreated from the previous session’s record high on Wednesday, with engineer Weir Group leading the market lower after warning about a significant drop in its revenue in the current year.
Weir Group, which makes valves and pumps for the energy and mining industries, fell 8.7 percent to the bottom of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index after saying uncertainty in the oil and gas industry would significantly reduce its revenue despite cost-cutting.
“People have been talking about inevitable cutbacks in oil exploration for quite along time, and you would have thought that those companies with exposure to the sector would have already been on investor radar screens,” Jeremy Batstone-Carr, market analyst at Charles Stanley, said.
“Given that, it’s surprising that there’s been such a sharp reaction to Weir’s outlook statement.”
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed down 14.25 points, or 0.2 percent at 6,935.38 points after setting a new record high of 6,958.89 points on Tuesday. That surpassed its previous high of 6,950.60 set on Dec. 30, 1999.
Among other sharp movers, mid-cap AO World slumped 31.7 percent after the British online domestic appliances retailer cut its full-year earnings outlook as the boost around the company’s flotation faded.
On the positive side, Whitbread rose 2.7 percent after saying it expected to post full-year profit toward the top end of market forecasts, as strong demand at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee chain helped deliver a 5.8 percent rise in fourth-quarter underlying sales.
“Investors will have few complaints on a growth stock where the share price has risen 22 percent over the last year. Despite this rapid appreciation, the market remains committed to the story with the consensus still coming in as a comfortable buy,” Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said.
St James’s Place was also in demand, with its shares rising 4.3 percent to the top of the FTSE 100’s gainers list after it posted forecast-beating full-year cash profits, boosted by a rise in assets that underpinned a surprise increase in the firm’s final dividend.

LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group is paying its first dividend in more than six years after reporting a rise in profit and improvements in its capital strength, a milestone in the bank’s recovery after it was bailed out during the financial crisis.
The bank, which was rescued at a cost of 20 billion pounds ($31 billion) to British taxpayers, said it would pay a dividend of 0.75 pence for the 2014 financial year.
Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said Lloyds, which offered some of the highest dividends in Britain before the crisis of 2007-2009, intended to pay out at least half of its sustainable earnings in the medium term.
Lloyds reported an underlying profit of 7.8 billion pounds, up from 6.2 billion the year before and ahead of market expectations for a profit of 7.5 billion pounds.
The bank said its core Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its financial strength, rose by 250 basis points to 12.8 percent.
“Today’s results are another major milestone in the recovery of the British economy from the great recession and the bank bailouts,” said Britain’s finance minister George Osborne.
The government will receive a dividend of 130 million pounds. It had already raised nearly 8 billion pounds from the sale of shares in the bank, reducing its stake to below 24 percent.
Horta-Osorio said paying a dividend would help the government sell its remaining shares because the stock would now be bought by dividend-seeking funds. Such investors accounted for over a quarter of Lloyds’ shareholder base prior to its bailout.
“We believe that the dividend will be very important in enabling the government to reduce its stake at an even quicker pace,” he said.
Lloyds’ last payment to shareholders was an 11.4 pence per share dividend for the first half of 2008, paid out in October of that year.
Lloyds is further along the road to recovery than its bailed-out rival Royal Bank of Scotland, which on Thursday reported a hefty 2014 loss.
RBS’s turnaround has been hampered by investigations into past misconduct and a sale of the government’s 79 percent stake remains some way off.
Shares in the bank rose 0.8 percent to 79.2p by 1620 GMT.
Horta-Osorio has turned Lloyds around since becoming its chief executive in 2011, simplifying the business and slimming down to focus on lending to British households and businesses and meet tougher regulatory rules on capital.
But Labour lawmaker John Mann, who sits on parliament’s Treasury Select Committee criticised the bank for handing Horta-Osorio a pay package for 2014 worth 11.5 million pounds.
“It’s obscenely high. Why’s he getting so much and the taxpayer so little?,” Mann told Reuters.
Horta-Osorio also said he would accept shares worth about 7 million pounds awarded under a plan set out in 2012, but would not sell them until the government has sold more shares.
Lloyds said it paid staff 370 million pounds in bonuses for 2014, down 4 percent from 2013. Top managers were handed bonuses worth 30 million pounds.
“People will be rightly taken aback by the huge scale of the bonuses being paid,” said Labour lawmaker Cathy Jamieson, the party’s spokeswoman for financial affairs.
Meanwhile, the Treasury on Friday apologised for incorrectly stating in a letter that Britain’s financial regulator had granted Lloyds permission to buy back bonds issued to strengthen its capital in 2009 at face value. In fact, the regulator has yet to make a decision.
The issue is sensitive because the bonds, which currently trade at a premium to their issue price, are held by thousands of private retail investors. ($1 = 0.6479 pounds) (Additional reporting by Steve Slater; Editing by Sinead Cruise, Keith Weir and Susan Thomas)

"Glencore Cuts 2015 Budget, Plans To Divest From Lonmin",Lonmin,-0.314,https://www.reuters.com/article/glencore-restructuring-idCNL5N0VL12B20150211,www.reuters.com,"UPDATE 1-Glencore to divest Lonmin stake, cut expenditure to counter to weak prices","* To cut capex to $6.5 bln-$6.8 bln vs previously expected $7.9bln
* To divest 23.9 percent stake in Lonmin via share distribution (Adds details on share distribution and capex cut)
LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Miner and commodities trader Glencore plans to divest its stake in platinum producer Lonmin and to cut capital expenditure this year in response to market volatility, it said on Wednesday as it reported increased copper and coal output.
Like its peers, Glencore has been hit by a rout in prices of commodities such as copper, coal and oil. The company’s shares have fallen by more than 9 percent so far this year.
On Wednesday it said it would cut capital expenditure for this year to between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion from a previously expected $7.9 billion.
“Responding to the volatile market backdrop, we have comprehensively reviewed the planned level of sustaining and expansionary capex in 2015 ... with reduced spend from across the broad portfolio,” the company said.
Glencore also said it intends to divest its 23.9 percent stake in Lonmin, inherited through the acquisition of Xstrata in May 2013, in the first half this year. It proposes to do so through a distribution of its shares to Glencore shareholders.
The London-listed company said it sees a distribution of shares as a better option than a sale at this point. Platinum prices have been stubbornly low in the last year, weighing on the value of platinum assets.
Lonmin said in a separate statement that it “views Glencore’s proposal as a constructive way forward”. (Reporting by Silvia Antonioli; Editing by David Goodman and David Holmes)

By Tom Bergin and Ron Bousso
LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Big oil companies had a poor record of finding and producing oil and gas last year, according to figures out in the past week - and big cuts in spending in response to falling crude prices could undermine their plans to turn that around.
Four of the world’s six biggest oil firms by market value - Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and ConocoPhillips - released provisional figures showing together they replaced only two-thirds of the hydrocarbons they extracted in 2014 with new reserves.
Combined, those four and industry leader Exxon Mobil posted an average drop in oil and gas production of 3.25 percent last year.
All predict their output will increase and new reserves will be added in coming years. But the 2014 results echo longer-term trends.
Over the past decade, the biggest Western oil companies have seen reserves growth stall, production drop 15 percent and profits fall by almost a fifth - even as oil prices almost doubled, a Reuters analysis of corporate filings shows.
Analysts and industry executives have blamed the sector’s anaemic performance in that period, in part, on companies’ approach to spending on new fields and infrastructure, tending to ramp it up when oil prices rise and cut when prices plummet, such as in the late 1990s and after the 2008 financial crisis.
The latest collapse has seen prices halve since June. In recent months, the biggest oil groups on both sides of the Atlantic have announced sharp cuts in capital expenditure (capex) out as far as 2017, as they seek to preserve cash to maintain dividends.
Investors have largely welcomed the focus on dividends. But some say the cuts could come back to bite the industry.
“Capex can’t be cut forever. Cuts in capex are only storing up problems for the sector down the road,” said Will Riley, fund manager with the Guinness Global Energy Fund, which holds shares in many of the big U.S. and European oil firms.
The ability of oil companies to replace reserves has not been as much of a concern for some executives and investors in recent years due to the shale oil boom.
But the high cost of extracting shale oil makes doing so profitably a challenge where prices are low - making traditional and less expensive reserves more relevant in a downturn.
BP and Chevron have announced around 13 percent cuts in capex for 2015, while ConocoPhillips last week upped its planned reductions in spending for 2015 to 33 percent. Shell and Exxon have not issued budget plans yet.
“We have to prioritise cash flow instead of growth for the time being,” Gerhard Roiss, chief executive of Vienna-based oil producer OMV AG, said last week as he announced an around 30 percent reduction in investment in new projects.
Oil executives play down worries about the sector’s fundamental health. They say lower production reflects an increased focus on returns, rather than output for its own sake, while falling reserves figures can be misleading.
“These (2014) reserve replacement numbers are a little lumpy ... I am not too alarmed about this year’s down(turn),” BP boss Bob Dudley told reporters this week.
However, even executives accept that excessive pruning of investments can cost them barrels and profits in the long term.
“Many of the things that you may do out of excessive prudence basically means that you lose them (the opportunities). They won’t come back anymore,” Shell CEO Ben van Buerden told investors last week.
Van Buerden said he would cut less than rivals to ensure he did not crimp Shell’s long-term prospects. Similarly, Exxon told investors on Monday that while it would monitor spending closely, it would not “forego any attractive opportunities”.
Nonetheless, Shell has shelved projects and put off $15 billion of spending it might have committed to over the next three years. Analysts at Jefferies predict Exxon will announce a 13 percent drop in capex when it presents its strategy plans in March.
Martijn Rats, head of oil companies research at Morgan Stanley in London, said in a research note this week that overly aggressive cuts could have long-term repercussions.
The expertise needed to develop new fields and infrastructure takes long periods to build up, he said. Hence, if companies lose this expertise, they may struggle to expand their portfolios when oil prices recover.
Executives say the risk is not only that companies may lose future growth opportunities but also that existing reserves may not be fully exploited.
Production from oil fields falls over time, because reservoir pressure drops as oil is extracted. Fields on average experience natural depletion rates of around 15 percent per year, industry executives say, but companies generally reduce this to 3-5 percent by sinking additional wells, injecting gas or by using other capital-intensive techniques.
Cutting capex will increase depletion rates, if past experience is an indicator.
“That is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to the 2008 and 2009 period ... we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry, increase by a percent or two. And that’s very significant,” Chevron CEO John Watson told investors last week.
Using data going back to the oil drop in the mid 1980s, analysts at Bernstein calculated the rise in depletion rates was 3 percentage points within two years after an oil price collapse began.
Across the industry, this could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil production each day.
Some investors and analysts say companies could yet use the downturn to help build long-term reserves and production.
Paul Mumford, fund manager with Cavendish Asset Management, said lower oil prices and a drop in drilling activity was leading to downward pressure on the prices firms which sell construction and drilling services to oil majors charge. This could encourage some companies to drill and build more, he said.
And Charles Whall, fund manager with Investec, said stronger companies should consider replacing reserves through acquisitions.
Morgan Stanley’s Rats added: “Sometimes, the best projects are done at the bottom of the cycle.”

Standard Life share price: Insurer buys advice firm Pearson Jones,Standard Life,0.364,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-standardlife-m-a-advice-idUKKBN0LA16820150206,www.reuters.com,Standard Life to offer financial advice with Pearson Jones buy,"LONDON (Reuters) - Insurer Standard Life has entered the UK financial advice business by buying British firm Pearson Jones from Skipton Building Society, responding to pension reforms that will boost demand.
Britain’s fourth-biggest insurer, with a market capitalisation of just under 10 billion pounds, said on Friday Pearson Jones had 1.1 billion pounds ($1.69 billion) in assets under advice. It did not disclose the purchase price.
Shock pension reforms announced last year, and due to come into effect in April, give retired people freedom over how to spend their pension pots and remove any obligation to buy an annuity, which gives an income for life.
Standard Life’s entry into financial advice was in response to “fundamental changes that are driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”, it said in a statement.
Sales of annuities have already fallen at least 50 percent since the announcement of the reforms, and insurers and fund managers are looking at other ways to fill the gap.
“This was a very good move from Standard Life,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon.
“There is a lot of demand for advice, and Standard Life may have stolen a march on others by making this small acquisition.”
Analysts expect similar moves from other insurers, as government reforms drive the demand for more independent financial advice.
A move away from expensive final salary company pension schemes in Britain has also increased the number of employees paying into defined contribution schemes, which produce a retirement pension pot.
Standard Life said it was focusing on the “mass affluent”, typically considered as having up to 1 million pounds to invest for retirement.
Steve Murray, who has developed Standard Life’s UK advice and distribution strategy, would lead the financial advice business, it said.
Pearson Jones has 102 employees and focuses on the north of England. Standard Life said it planned to develop a nationwide advice business.
The deal is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2015, Standard Life said.
Standard Life’s shares rose 0.4 percent to 403 pence.

TRLPC - CRH backs Lafarge Holcim asset buy with 6.5 bln euro bridge loan,Lafarge Holcim,0.365,https://www.reuters.com/article/crh-loans-idCNL6N0VC1XT20150202,www.reuters.com,TRLPC-CRH backs Lafarge Holcim asset buy with 6.5 bln euro bridge loan,"LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Banks have lined up a 6.5 billion euro ($7.37 billion) bridge loan to back Irish building supplies group CRH’s 6.5 billion euro acquisition of assets that rivals Lafarge and Holcim needed to sell ahead of their planned merger, CRH announced.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and UBS are bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers on the senior unsecured bridge loan facility which comprises a 2 billion euro tranche A maturing December 31 2015; a 3.5 billion euro tranche B maturing June 30 2016; and a 1 billion euro tranche C maturing June 30 2018.
CRH can extend the maturity dates of tranche A and tranche B twice, each time by six months. The loan will be taken out by proceeds from assets sales and from new bonds.
In June 2014, CRH raised a 2.5 billion euro, five-year revolving credit facility.
CRH will also use 2 billion euros of cash on balance sheet to fund the acquisition, as well as an equity raising of around 1.5 billion euros.
CRH said it was buying assets mainly in Europe, Canada, Brazil and the Philippines. CRH will not keep sole control of all the assets it agreed to buy and is in talks with private equity firm KKR to partner on investing in the UK assets.
Bankers lined up just over 1 billion pounds ($1.50 billion) of debt financing to back private equity firm KKR’s investment in the UK assets, equating to around 5.5 times the UK asset’s EBITDA of approximately 170 million pounds.
CRH, with annual revenues of 18 billion euros in 2014, beat a consortium led by Blackstone. CRH was in a stronger position than the buyout firms because it could integrate the assets into its own business, and so offer a higher price, a source said.
In a conference call with reporters, the chief executives of the merging firms said the CRH deal price included the assumption by the Irish firm of about 1.3 billion euros of debt. CRH, which had a net debt of around 2.5 billion euros or 1.5 times earnings at the end of 2014, is also embarking on a disposal plan of its own.
Lafarge and Holcim announced merger plans last year, hoping to cut costs and tackle overcapacity and weak demand. Their new company will be the world’s biggest cement maker with $44 billion in annual sales.
Holcim and Lafarge initially received more than 60 tentative bids from industry and private equity firms for some or all of the assets. ($1 = 0.8814 euros) ($1 = 0.6656 pounds) (Editing by Christopher Mangham)

"Buffett's Berkshire builds Deere stake, dumps Exxon",Deere,0.316,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investments-funds-buffett-idUSKBN0LL28220150218,www.reuters.com,"Buffett's Berkshire builds Deere stake, dumps Exxon","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co DE.N and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N as oil prices plunged.
The changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate’s domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.
Berkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.
Deere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.
Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.
Deere declined to comment.
Berkshire’s decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.
Exxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half.
It is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.
Buffett “is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,” said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.
Exxon Mobil declined to comment.
Berkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O.
It further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.NQSR.TO, the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Berkshire helped finance Burger King's purchase of Tim Hortons last year and got Restaurant Brands shares through the merger.
Berkshire also added to holdings in IBM Corp IBM.N, General Motors Co GM.N, Phillips 66 PSX.N, Suncor Energy Inc SU.TO and DirecTV DTV.O, among others, and shed stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips COP.N and pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O.
U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter.
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns more than 80 businesses ranging from Dairy Queen ice cream to Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad.

AstraZeneca's patent on asthma drug invalidated by US court,AstraZeneca,-0.656,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-astrazeneca-outlook-idUKKBN0LK01L20150216,www.reuters.com,AstraZeneca's patent on asthma drug invalidated by U.S. court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled late on Friday that AstraZeneca PLC's AZN.L patent on its Pulmicort Repsules treatment for asthma was invalid, opening up the market to a second, cheaper generic version.
Actavis Plc ACT.N said that the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruling prompted it to release a generic version of the lung drug. Another generic version of Pulmicort Respules from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.N, under a previous agreement with AstraZeneca, has been on the market for some time. 
Total branded and generic sales of Pulmicort over the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 were approximately $1.1 billion (714 million pounds), according to Actavis.
Paul Hudson, president of AstraZeneca’s U.S. operations, said that the company strongly disagreed with the court’s decision and that it is considering legal options, including an appeal.
In April 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey invalidated AstraZeneca’s patent on its Pulmicort treatment, but that ruling was reversed and remanded in October 2013 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
AstraZeneca said the decision would not have an impact on its 2015 guidance of a mid single-digits percent decline in sales revenue and a low single-digit percent gain in core earnings per share, assuming currency exchange rates remain constant.

New Credit Suisse boss faces stiff challenge in Asia,Credit Suisse,-0.181,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-creditsuisse-ceo-investmentbank-idUSKBN0M70UI20150312,www.reuters.com,New Credit Suisse boss faces stiff challenge in Asia,"HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Incoming Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam is expected to focus on private banking in Asia while aggressively cutting jobs at its investment bank, as he aims to repeat the success in the region of his old employer, Prudential.
Thiam could slash 3,000 jobs from Credit Suisse’s investment bank, or 15 percent of staff globally, and cut 150 billion Swiss francs ($149 billion) of assets from the bank’s fixed income, commodities and currencies business as part of that shift, analysts at JPMorgan said.
That may include Asia, where the former insurance executive will find a fiercely competitive landscape, dominated by cross-town rival UBS in the wealth management space and increasingly crowded with aggressive local players in investment banking.
“Prudential’s markets in Asia have been green-field, high-growth and not over-competitive,” said Keith Pogson, senior partner for Asia-Pacific financial services at consulting firm EY.
“But in the banking system low-cost local players are becoming stronger and stronger competitors. It’s a very different landscape.”
Thiam takes over after current CEO Brady Dougan leaves in June.
UBS - which shifted its focus to the region earlier - has nearly twice the assets under managements in Asia, though Credit Suisse is starting to make significant strides there.
Last year, Asia Pacific accounted for 63 percent of all net new wealth Credit Suisse attracted, bringing total wealth management assets managed in the region to 143.5 billion Swiss francs, confirming Asia as a main driver of growth.
By contrast, UBS’s wealth management division had 269 billion Swiss francs of invested assets in the region at the end of 2014.
“Asia as a subsegment, it’s been a very important area of growth for Credit Suisse. Even though margins tend to be lower, from a growth point of view, it’s still highly attractive,” said Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura in London.
Credit Suisse’s investment banking division in Asia Pacific, is also lagging UBS, according to Thomson Reuters data. In advisory rankings Credit Suisse has fallen every year since 2010, from 4th place then to 15th last year and 17th in the year to date.
In equity capital markets rankings, where Swiss rival UBS has consistently been the top-ranked player in Asia since 2010, Credit Suisse ranked 6th in 2014 and 4th in 2013, the data show.
And in debt underwriting, Credit Suisse again ranked outside the top 10 advisors every year since 2010.
Thiam, who contrary to Dougan has no experience of investment banking, may be sufficiently detached from the business to make some tough choices, bankers say.
“Asia has been a fairly difficult area for European investment banks to make money. The investment bank is the main question over the new CEO strategy,” said Simon Adamson, European banking analyst at CreditSights.
“If they do decide to scale back, that would also include their Asia business.”

Sainsbury's says to outperform rivals in tough market,Sainsbury,0.536,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sainsbury-outlook-idUKKBN0MD0LD20150317,www.reuters.com,Sainsbury's says to outperform rivals in tough market,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Sainsbury’s expressed confidence in outperforming its supermarket peers and played down the threat posed by recovering rival Tesco on Tuesday, although it said no quick improvement in tough trading conditions was expected.
Sainsbury’s in common with rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, is grappling with food price deflation and an intensifying price war launched to counter discounters Aldi and Lidl.
They are also having to adapt as consumers shop more frequently, buy more online and shop locally rather than at out-of-town stores.
Sainsbury’s posted a fifth consecutive quarter of declining underlying sales but it said measures laid out in November’s strategic update were working, enabling it to combat the discounters’ threat and Tesco, whose turnaround under new boss Dave Lewis appears to be gathering pace.
Shares in Sainsbury’s, down 14 percent over the last year, were up 1.3 percent at 272 pence at 0952 GMT. Tesco shares were down 0.9 percent.
Sainsbury’s is cutting costs, dividends and new store openings to fund an extra 150 million pounds ($222 million) in lower prices. It is also investing in improving the quality of its products and expanding its non-food, online and convenience business.
“I’ve competed with Tesco my entire career. The important thing for us is to focus on doing what we do,” CEO Mike Coupe told reporters.
“We’re confident in the plan that we set out to execute. And the stuff that we’ve done so far seems to be pointing in the right direction.”
He noted that where the firm has cut prices it has seen average volume growth of more than 3 percent. Sales at convenience stores were up 14 percent, while online grocery order numbers and sales were up 14 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
However, some analysts remain unconvinced.
“It feels to us that it could be particularly negatively impacted by a sustained better out-turn from Tesco UK, making Coupe’s assertion that Sainsbury will outperform its peers all the more interesting,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
Sainsbury’s sales at stores open more than a year fell 1.9 percent, excluding fuel, in the 10 weeks to March 14, its fiscal fourth quarter. That was in line with company guidance and follows a third-quarter fall of 1.7 percent.
“We expect the market to remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Food deflation is likely to persist for the rest of this calendar year, and competitive pressures on price will continue,” Coupe said.

* UK’s biggest listing since Royal Mail, by market value
* UK’s largest-ever private equity-backed listing (Updates share price, adds comment, context, detail)
LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Shares in online car marketplace Auto Trader Group rose more than 16 percent on their debut in London on Thursday after Britain’s largest ever private equity-backed listing.
The flotation gave the company a market value of 2.35 billion pounds ($3.5 billion), making it also Britain’s biggest listing of any kind since the government sold shares in Royal Mail in late 2013.
The company, which started out in the 1970s as a weekly magazine, went fully digital in 2013 under private equity owner Apax Partners after magazine circulation slumped.
It operates Britain’s leading website for buying and selling new and used cars. The firm has focused its efforts on appealing to smartphone and tablet users, who run over 400,000 Auto Trader searches daily.
Auto Trader shares rose as much as 16.5 percent from the offer price of 235 pence to almost 274 pence, and at 1515 GMT were up 15 percent.
The company raised about 437 million pounds in the offer, while Apax reaped proceeds of 926 million pounds from a sale of 59 percent of the company.
Including an over-allotment option for up to 15 percent of shares, Apax would be left with a holding of around 25 percent. The size of the offering is larger than usual, and far above Britain’s listing requirements of 25 percent.
“They took the opportunity to reduce their overhang. They could have priced higher but they chose instead to do the bigger deal,” said a source close to the deal, referring to the unusually large proportion of shares that the fund is selling.
Apax acquired 49.9 percent of Auto Trader from the Guardian Media Group in 2007 in a deal that valued the business at 1.35 billion pounds. It subsequently bought the rest of the company in 2014 for 619 million pounds.
The listing follows an approach by U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman earlier this year with a potential 2 billion-pound takeover offer.
Analysts raised questions about next steps for the brand, which focuses chiefly on the UK and Ireland. It generates 250 million pounds of revenue a year and employs 830 people.
“It’s an online business that really does only one thing. Competitors such as eBay and Gumtree could impact that,” said Mike Butler, analyst at data provider Eagle Alpha, adding that Auto Trader is seen by some car dealerships as expensive.
“One option would be a bolt-on business in the UK, like an insurance arm, to build the brand here. A new territory is a bigger undertaking,” Butler said.
Money raised from IPOs is down 16 percent globally as of March 12 this year compared with the same period of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data, although the number of offerings is on a par.
Last year saw a spate of private equity-backed offerings, including British retailers Poundland and Pets at Home , as funds took advantage of surging stock markets to exit investments made before the crisis.

LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis said on Monday they had completed a series of asset swaps worth more than $20 billion that will reshape both drugmakers.
GSK is forming a consumer health joint venture with Novartis, while at the same time buying the Swiss company’s vaccines business and divesting its cancer drugs portfolio to Novartis.
The two companies originally announced the transactions in April 2014 to bolster their best businesses and exit weaker ones as the drugs industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and increased generic competition.
GSK, which now plans to return 4 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) to shareholders, said it would provide an in-depth view of its prospects at an investor meeting to be held when it reports first-quarter results on May 6.
The complex deals are more significant for GSK than for Novartis, reflecting the fact that the British group’s market value is less than half that of its Swiss rival.
After holding off from providing financial guidance for this year when it reported annual results last month, GSK said it would provide 2015 earnings guidance and “profile the medium and long-term shape and opportunities” of the group on May 6.
The transactions come at a critical time for the British drugmaker, which will see new chairman Philip Hampton take over on May 7.
Hampton, who chairs Royal Bank of Scotland, takes the reins following a tough year at GSK, which was hit by a record fine of nearly $500 million in China for bribing doctors and has disappointed investors with weak lung drug sales.
The poor performance resulted in the bonus paid to Chief Executive Andrew Witty for 2014 being cut by 51 percent.
GSK is receiving net after tax proceeds from the Novartis transactions of $7.8 billion, the majority of which will be distributed to shareholders through a so-called B share scheme.
For Novartis, the asset swaps will boost the company’s already substantial presence in oncology and are expected to lift core margins immediately.
The Swiss drugmaker now has a portfolio of 22 oncology and haematology medicines, with the GSK deal providing new therapies in melanoma, kidney and blood cancers.
Novartis is paying $16 billion for GSK’s cancer drugs, although up to $1.5 billion of this may have to be returned to Novartis if GSK’s melanoma drugs fail to meet expectations. GSK believes the necessary conditions will be satisfied, after recent positive clinical trial results.
On top of the transactions with GSK, Novartis also sold its animal health business to Eli Lilly.

"Aviva, Friends Life top forecasts ahead of 5.6 billion pound merger",Friends Life,0.39,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-aviva-results-idUKKBN0M10KM20150305,www.reuters.com,"Aviva, Friends Life top forecasts ahead of 5.6 billion pound merger","LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers Aviva Plc AV.L and Friends Life Group Plc FLG.L reported forecast-beating yearly profits on Thursday, lifting their shares to multi-year highs ahead of a 5.6 billion pound agreed merger due to complete next month.
Aviva is acquiring Friends Life as changes in the UK pensions market put pressure on life insurance companies, leading to a drop in their sales of income-bearing annuities.
The deal is expected to bring 225 million pounds in annual savings, Aviva reiterated on Thursday, and material capital savings, without giving further detail.
Aviva Chief Executive Mark Wilson, appointed two years ago from Asian rival AIA 1299.HK with the task of restructuring the company, told reporters: ""The proposed acquisition of Friends Life accelerates our turnaround and our ability to deliver our investment thesis.""
Aviva reported a 6 percent rise in operating profit to 2.17 billion pounds, a touch higher than forecasts of 2.15 billion in a company-supplied poll. Friends Life’s operating profit jumped 38 percent to 556 million, beating forecasts of 352 million in its company poll.
Aviva shares hit their highest since Sept 2008 and were trading at 557.5 pence at 0850 GMT, up 4.6 percent. Friends rose to April 2009 highs and were trading at 424p, also up 4.6 percent and an 8 percent premium to their close on Nov. 20, when the two announced merger plans.
“Aviva’s results represent a small beat compared to consensus on pretty much every key metric,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon in a client note, reiterating his “buy” recommendation.
Holders of Friends stock will receive 0.74 new Aviva shares for each Friends share. Investors, who vote on the merger on March 26, have said the deal makes sense as a way to cope with UK pension changes.
The reforms, to be implemented next month, allow retirees to use their pension pots as they choose, rather than forcing them to buy an income-bearing annuity.
Aviva said the value of new business for its UK annuity business fell 16 percent, as bulk annuity sales, or taking on the risk of company final-salary pensions, failed to outweigh a drop in individual annuity sales.
Friends also reported a 15 percent drop in annuity sales.
Aviva’s fund management arm is looking to an increase of up to 70 billion pounds in funds under management with the Friends acquisition, boosting total funds under management above 300 billion.
The company said a 16 percent rise in Aviva Investors’ operating profit “remains inadequate”. It signed a deal in January with Virtus Investment Partners in the United States, which Wilson said would help distribution.
In emerging markets, Wilson said Aviva was considering options for its Indian joint venture with Dabur Group following a rule change increasing foreign investment limits. Options could include selling the business, Wilson said.
Aviva will pay a final dividend of 12.25p per share, up 30 percent, making a total of 18.1p. Friends will pay a total 31.15p, subject to completion of the merger.

UK's FTSE has worst day so far in 2015 as BG and Prudential fall,Prudential,-0.651,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-markets-stocks-ftse/ftse-has-worst-day-so-far-in-2015-as-bg-and-pru-fall-idUKKBN0M60T720150310,www.reuters.com,FTSE has worst day so far in 2015 as BG and Pru fall,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top share index suffered its biggest decline so far this year on Tuesday, hit by drops in insurer Prudential PRU.L and energy stocks such as BG BG.L.
Prudential fell 3.1 percent as the loss of its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, to Credit Suisse CSGN.VX took the shine off a 14 percent rise in 2014 operating profits.
Energy stocks also slumped as oversupply and weak demand pushed Brent crude oil futures down. BG dropped 7.4 percent, Tullow Oil TLW.L 7 percent. [O/R]
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index .FTSE ended down 2.5 percent at 6,702.84 points. The FTSE has retreated from the record high of 6,974.26 points it reached on March 2. It remains up by 2 percent since the start of the year.
Engineer Weir Group WEIR.L fell 3.3 percent, reversing some recent gains. It had rallied nearly 12 percent since last Thursday on speculation that Weir, hurt by cutbacks in by oil firms, might attract interest from U.S. private equity firms.
On a brighter note, shares in financial services group Charles Stanley CAY.L -- which is not in the main FTSE 100 index -- rose 5.4 percent after the group said it might sell its Charles Stanley Securities arm.
Some investors have said uncertainty leading up to Britain’s general election in May may hinder the FTSE and prevent it from reaching record highs around 7,000 points.
Gerren O’Neill, senior trader at Thames Capital Markets, said the FTSE could drift lower in coming weeks but find support around 6,700 or 6,600 points.
“We continue to see further downside from here, but any pullback should be relatively short-lived,” he said.

Credit Suisse poaches Prudential's Thiam for Asian push,Credit Suisse,0.125,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-gp-ceo-dougan-idUKKBN0M601320150310,www.reuters.com,Credit Suisse poaches Prudential's Thiam for Asian push,"ZURICH/LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has swooped on Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam to lead the Swiss bank in a push to manage more of the wealth held by Asia’s fast growing club of multi-millionaires.
Thiam, a 52-year-old former Ivory Coast government minister, will replace American chief executive Brady Dougan, who has drawn fire for failing to reform the bank and scale back its risky investment banking business fast enough.
In a sign of Thiam’s standing with investors, news of his move added almost $3 billion to Credit Suisse’s market value on Tuesday and cut Prudential’s by nearly $2 billion.
As Prudential PRU.L boss - and the first black head of a FTSE 100 company - Thiam has built up a strong Asian track record, expanding the British-based insurer's sales in the region since 2009 and trebling its share price in the process.
While Thiam has never run a bank, shareholders and analysts regard his experience in dealing with financial regulators as a strength while lenders must implement a blitz of new rules imposed following the global financial crisis.
Dougan, 55, had been criticized for not paring back Credit Suisse's CSGN.VX investment bank enough after the introduction of global regulations forcing banks to hold more capital so that they could survive another crisis.
Chairman Urs Rohner said the bank would press on with its current strategy under Thiam, a multi-linguist whose private interests range from soccer to Russian literature.
“As you know, we have a strategy of growing the wealth management business,” Rohner said, adding that he wanted a more balanced allocation of the bank’s capital between the wealth management and the investment banking businesses. “It is not about a fundamental redirection,” he told a news conference.
Thiam was guarded on his plans. “Credit Suisse has been successful but I don’t know an organization that doesn’t need change,” he said. “There are things that need to be improved. I’m not in a position to go any further in the answer.”
Credit Suisse’s shares closed up 7.76 percent, adding $2.93 billion to its market value, while Prudential’s lost 3.1 percent, wiping $1.99 billion from its capitalization.
He was hailed as a star by the Swiss media, with tabloid Blick dubbing him the “Obama of Credit Suisse” whose appointment was a sign of Switzerland’s openness to the world.
Tages Anzeiger said Thiam might be much better suited to lead Credit Suisse than Dougan, an outsider in Switzerland whose departure was “long overdue”.
Under Dougan, Credit Suisse survived the crisis without resorting to a taxpayer-funded bailout. But he faced calls to quit last year when the bank reached a $2.5 billion settlement with U.S. authorities for helping Americans to evade taxes via secret bank accounts.
He will leave at the end of June after 25 years at the bank and eight as CEO, when he was one of the world’s highest-paid bankers with his salary topping 90 million Swiss francs ($91 million) in one year. More recently, he had embarked on several rounds of cost-cutting.
“Thiam has no banking experience but it could be that an outsider can make some of the decisions they were not able to make internally,” said one investor in Credit Suisse, who asked not to be named.
Thiam left Ivory Coast in his early 30s following a coup and joined consulting firm McKinsey & Co in Paris - making him now the third ex-McKinsey member on Credit Suisse’s 10-strong executive board. People who have worked with him said he has a sharp intellect and deals well with regulators and colleagues.
While at Prudential, Thiam failed in an attempt to take over Asian-focused insurer AIA 1299.HK in 2010 after a shareholder rebellion. Nevertheless, he successfully concentrated on Asia to drive profits.
His recruitment raises expectations that he will cut Credit Suisse's investment bank hard at last. Its European rivals such as UBS UBSG.VX have been faster to shrink this business and focus on other areas of strength.
“Thiam’s background in insurance and asset management suggests Credit Suisse’s focus is moving increasingly away from investment banking,” said a UK-based fund manager, who was reviewing his position after selling the bank’s shares on concerns about capital requirements.
Dougan's departure leaves JP Morgan's JPM.N Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs's GS.N Lloyd Blankfein as the only two global banking CEOs still in place since the 2008-09 crisis. 
The Credit Suisse board backed Dougan over the U.S. settlement, under which the bank pleaded guilty to criminal charges but kept its New York license. However, he was criticized by some politicians and media in Switzerland.
Thiam has the languages to help build bridges with Swiss politicians wary of bankers after having to bail out UBS. He addressed his first Credit Suisse news conference in German and French as well as English.
A fan of English football club Arsenal, he lists “The Brothers Karamazov” by 19th century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky as his favorite book and his top song is Tadieu Bone by Ismael Lo, a guitarist from Senegal, his father’s country.
Asked on a BBC radio show two years ago how he felt leading people, Thiam said: “It’s a bit like walking a tightrope because you feel all these expectations around you and it’s rarely comfortable. If you really believe in what it is you are trying to achieve it helps you go through a journey and walk without looking down.”
Prudential, Britain’s largest insurer by market value, confirmed Thiam’s departure as it reported a 14 percent rise in operating profit in 2014.
The firm said a successor has been identified and would be announced after the regulatory approval process. Thiam is expected to remain in place until after first quarter results are released in May. The insurance group declined to comment on media reports that its U.S. business head Mike Wells would get the job.

Randgold profit hit by poor gold price but dividend still increases,Rangold,-0.052,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-randgold-rsrcs-results-idUKKCN10F0VH,www.reuters.com,Strong gold price could hike Randgold dividend by year-end,"(Reuters) - Randgold Resources Ltd RRS.L could hike its dividend payout by the end of the year, it said on Thursday, as strong gold prices improve its cash position, although second-quarter profit was flat after its gold output fell short of forecasts.
Investor uncertainties including Britain's vote to leave the European Union spurred spot gold XAU= to a two-year high early in July.
At the end of its second quarter, Randgold’s net cash reached $273 million and cash reserves should rise to $500 million by the end of the year, Chief Executive Mark Bristow said.
“We don’t want to sit on a growing, lazy balance sheet... we have always said once we get to half a billion we will re-look at the pace of that dividend increase,” Bristow told Reuters on the sidelines of a results briefing.
The firm paid $52 million in dividends in the second quarter, flat on a year ago.
Randgold on Thursday reported flat second-quarter profit from mining, as lower production and a rise in costs offset higher gold prices.
Gold production during the quarter was hit by mechanical breakdowns at a mill in its Ivory Coast mine and technical problems at its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the company said.
But Bristow said the flagship Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali should ensure it met its full-year production target of 1.25-1.3 million ounces.
The firm's stock fell as much as 12 percent early on Thursday, but later recovered to trade around 4 percent lower, compared with a roughly 1 percent fall across the sector. .FTNMX1770
Analysts were cautious after Randgold’s output undershot forecasts.
“Given that the gold price is rising right now they could increase the dividend sooner than the market had expected. But whatever they lift the dividend has to be sustainable,” Investec mining analyst Hunter Hillcoat said.
Investec had forecast second quarter production of 295,000 ounces at cash costs of $653 per ounce. Randgold reported production of 281,494 at cash costs of $661/oz.
The company reported a $150.6 million profit from mining for the three months to June 30.

"FDA panel backs safety updates for AstraZeneca, Takeda drugs",AstraZeneca,0.143,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-onglyza-fda-idUSKBN0N51U920150414,www.reuters.com,"FDA panel backs safety updates for AstraZeneca, Takeda drugs","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc’s diabetes drug Onglyza and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s rival product Nesina should carry information about the risk of heart failure, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The panel reviewed safety data on AstraZeneca’s Onglyza and Takeda’s Nesina. The drugs belong to a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors which also includes Merck & Co.’s Januvia. Januvia data from a trial known as TECOS will be presented at a scientific meeting in June.
The studies were requested by the FDA as part of a broader investigation into the safety of diabetes drugs. In December 2008, the agency issued guidance requiring companies to conduct studies to show the drugs did not increase cardiovascular risk.
The panel found that neither Onglyza nor Nesina increased the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack. But data showed a statistically significant increase in the risk of heart failure with Onglyza and an increased risk with Nesina that did not reach statistical significance.
Some panelists said that even though the heart failure risk seen with Nesina was modest, they suspect the risk will turn out to be a DPP-4 class effect and therefore worth including.
The panel did not recommend any restrictions on prescribing the drugs. AstraZeneca’s U.S. shares rose 3.2 percent. Takeda’s shares closed down 0.67 percent before the vote was announced. Merck’s shares rose 1.8 percent.
“Given the absence of a serious safety issue for either Onglyza or Takeda’s Nesina suggests that, barring an overtly negative signal in TECOS, growth of the DPP-4 class is likely to continue without a meaningful change in current prescribing trends,” Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.
A preliminary FDA review of Onglyza published on Friday found an increase in the rate of death from all causes. Panel members said they were moderately concerned about the signal but said their concern was muted by the fact that the causes of death were varied and lacked any common theme.
Onglyza, known also as saxagliptin, was approved in 2009. Nesina, or alogliptin, was approved in 2013. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.

Germanwings disaster will not affect image of budget air travel - easyJet,Germanwings,-0.046,https://www.reuters.com/article/easyjet-ceo/germanwings-disaster-will-not-affect-image-of-budget-air-travel-easyjet-idINKBN0MR1XR20150331,www.reuters.com,Germanwings disaster will not affect image of budget air travel - easyJet ,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The disaster at budget airline Germanwings which killed 150 people will not harm the image of low-cost air travel in Europe, easyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said on Tuesday.
Airlines across the world were left reeling after investigators said they believed the co-pilot of a Germanwings flight locked himself alone in the cockpit and deliberately steered it into a mountain, killing everyone on board.
Germanwings, founded in 2002 as a budget carrier, was acquired by full-service airline Lufthansa in 2009, and the parent company has expanded it into its main short-haul operator to battle competition from low-cost carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair.
McCall, in Amsterdam to open a new base for the airline, said the Germanwings crash was a matter for all airlines.
“This is not a budget airline issue. This is an airline issue. This is an industry thing,” she told Reuters in an interview.
EasyJet moved swiftly to change its cockpit policy as details emerged of what had caused the crash, requiring two crew members to be on the flightdeck at all times.
Under European regulations, pilots were permitted to leave the cockpit temporarily at certain times and under certain circumstances, leaving the other pilot alone. Since the crash, the EU has advised airlines to have two crew members on the flightdeck at all times.
“I think that every airline will be looking at everything they do in light of what’s happened,” McCall said.
After German prosecutors said Lubitz had hidden an illness from his employers, strict German laws on doctor-patient confidentiality have come under the spotlight.
Any changes to a pilot’s right to medical confidentiality would be an issue not just for the airline industry, but on a wider scale, McCall said.
“That’s an ethics issue. It’s something that the government will have to address. If they don’t do it in the Army, the Navy, there are equally sensitive areas that have the same levels of confidentiality. It would be a much bigger deal than just an airline thing.”
EasyJet, she added, has for years done more than is required by legislation to ensure the well-being of its pilots through its fatigue-reporting management system, which is used to keep a check on pilot tiredness.
Budget airlines have a reputation for pushing for the lowest pilot pay and the most flexible working arrangements to keep a lid on costs.
EasyJet, unlike some other carriers, said it employs staff directly on permanent contracts and aims to pay a median salary for the country where staff members are based, plus performance and company-related bonuses which can take pay higher.
But for McCall safety is about culture, not wages.
“I don’t think safety has anything to do with pay,” she said. “No one doubts that safety is the number one priority of the airline. I think that’s embedded in our culture.”
“Safety is entirely to do with the culture of an airline, with the professionalism of people that you employ, and that comes down to new recruits, how you recruit how you treat people and how the safety culture permeates the airline,” she said.

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L) upgraded its annual net sales outlook on Friday thanks to higher client spending, but shares in the world's largest advertising group slid nearly 8% as the news failed to excite investors expecting stronger forecasts.

The results come as investors and analysts look to gauge how advertising will perform against a backdrop of high inflation and slowing global economic growth.

Shares in WPP fell 7.8% to 822.60 pence on the London Stock Exchange by 0845 GMT. The stock has climbed 17.2% over the past month, compared with a 6% advance for the FTSE 100 (.FTSE).

WPP now expects like-for-like net sales to grow 6%-7% in 2022, up from an already upgraded forecast of 5.5%-6.5%. It left its headline operating margin outlook unchanged.

Analysts and traders said WPP's results and outlook, while strong, failed to reflect the momentum seen in much more upbeat results from rival ad group Publicis last month.

""Market participants were unimpressed ... because they were somewhat expecting more for such a firm with strong prospects,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at Tradition.

WPP, owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies, also said the travel sector was also rebounding strongly, with 23% growth in the first half, although sales still remained below pre-pandemic levels.

Chief Executive Mark Read said he was not particularly worried about a forecast recession in Britain, pointing to client spending holding up across industries and markets. The UK accounts for 13% of WPP's overall business.

""We're yet to see any major impact on advertising spend,"" he said in an interview. ""We are in very close contact with our clients on spending patterns and their investments and consumer spending has held up around the world surprisingly well."""
LONDON MORNING BRIEFING: HSBC And Standard Chartered Shares Rise,Standard Chartered,0.556,https://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-protests-hsbc-hldg-stanchart-idUKL4N2DH0RU,www.reuters.com,"HSBC, StanChart shares rise in Hong Kong after backing China security law","HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered rose on Thursday after the banks backed China's imposition of a national security law on the city, even as a pro-democracy and newly formed financial workers’ union criticized the move.
Some staff at the Asia-focussed British banks and analysts said HSBC and Standard Chartered’s stance on the law would help them protect their businesses in their single most important market of Hong Kong.
HSBC shares were up 1.6% at noon, after having risen as much as 2.8% earlier, and StanChart jumped 2.3%. The broader Hang Seng market index was down 0.1%.
In a break from their usual policy of political neutrality, both banks on Wednesday backed the national security law that has drawn global condemnation and revived anti-government demonstrations in the former British colony.
“Investors should welcome these statements,” said Hao Hong, Hong Kong-based head of research at brokerage BOCOM International. “It could get shitty if you are in the city and don’t support the law.”
The Global Times, which is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, said, citing a Chinese expert, that HSBC’s move should have come earlier, but can also be seen as “never too late”.
HSBC was caught up in Hong Kong’s months-long anti-government protests that started in 2019, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march at the start of this year.
Some protesters accused HSBC of being complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support protesters, accusations the bank has denied.
Some of HSBC’s corporate peers including Cathay Pacific Airways have faced retribution from Beijing for perceived support for the anti-government protesters.
“The reason for the statement is white terror, forced action to protect the bank’s business,” Wong, an HSBC staff in Hong Kong who declined to give his full name, told Reuters.
“When (these) two banks started to take stand, it will be no surprise that other banks will start to follow suit.”
But the Hong Kong Finance General Employee Union, formed in September to bring together the local financial professionals amid pro-democracy protests, has criticised the move.
“HSBC and Standard Chartered should clarify if they are betraying Hong Kong people while most of the governments from the western world are against this evil law and supporting Hong Kong people,” union Chairman Ka-Wing Kwok said.

Ninety-eight percent of BP shareholders supported the plan proposed by a group of investors and non-governmental organisations at its annual general meeting in London.
“This resolution is about disclosure, it’s not about setting targets,” said BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg at the event. BP did not specify what shape the disclosures will take.
A number of shareholders at the meeting, including a representative of the $300 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, said voting through the resolution was fundamental to them retaining BP stocks.
Some of BP’s top 20 shareholders including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Schroders and AXA Investment Managers had declared their support ahead of the vote.
“I suspect that these will be the first of many board-supported shareholder resolutions on this topic during the critical 2015-20 climate policy making window,” said Helen Wildsmith, head of ethical and responsible investment at CCLA, who lead the group’s engagement with BP.
Outside the meeting, protesters displayed banners and posters against BP’s involvement in Canada’s tar sands oil exploration.

Shell challenges Exxon dominance with 47 billion-pound bid for BG,Exxon,-0.196,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bg-group-m-a-shell-recommendation-idUKKBN0MZ0CU20150409,www.reuters.com,Shell challenges Exxon dominance with 47 billion-pound bid for BG,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group for 47 billion pounds ($70 billion) in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. Exxon Mobil after a plunge in prices.
Anglo-Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that values each BG share at around 1,350 pence, the companies said. This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential counter-bid by a company such as Exxon, which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand.
The third-biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. BG has some of the world’s most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal.
Shell is already the world’s leading LNG company and it would get BG’s capacity in LNG logistics - complex infrastructure that includes terminals, pipelines, specialised tankers, rigs, super coolers, regasification facilities and storage points.
“We are seeing a gasification of energy demand. Shell clearly recognise this,” said Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia. “That said, Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn’t go back up (in the next 24 months), I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow.”
Shell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent.
Stitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the tie-up follows a halving of oil prices since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration. Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals.
“We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,” Van Beurden told a conference call. “We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas”.
Britain’s BG had a market capitalisation of $46 billion at Tuesday’s close, Shell was worth $202 billion and Exxon, the world’s largest energy company by market value, was worth $360 billion.
BG’s bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence. Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982.5 pence. They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday, with $1.6 billion of BG shares changing hands and $3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares.
BG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices began. The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG’s share price of a year ago.
“In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term,” said Henderson Global Investors. Brent crude was trading below $57 a barrel on Wednesday.
Barclays bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG’s portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil, “something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late”.
One source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely. The source said a U.S. company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker Pfizer’s attempted takeover of AstraZeneca last year.
The deal represents a windfall for Shell’s adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BG’s advisers are Goldman Sachs and the smaller Robey Warshaw.
BAML has underwritten a 3.025-billion-pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising, according to the offer documents.
With BG, Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Global LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year. The new Shell-BG group would have 18 percent of world output.
Van Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia, Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities, but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.
The halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium, when large mergers reshaped the industry. Back then, BP acquired rivals Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron merged with Texaco.
“A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector,” said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research.
But some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega-deals, saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure.
“If you’re looking to the next big deal, Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger,” said Wood Mackenzie. “But don’t expect a wave of late ‘90s-style consolidation.”
Shell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.
The deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.
Last year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway’s Statoil to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition.
However, it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year, and Gould, a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger.
“I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,” Van Beurden told a conference call. “What has happened in the last month, apart from it being a logical deal, it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,”

Rolls-Royce Wins $9.2 Billion Order From Emirates Airline,Rolls-Royce,0.777,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-rolls-royce-order-emirates-airline-idUKKBN0N80QC20150417,www.reuters.com,Rolls-Royce wins $9.2 billion order from Emirates for A380 engines,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce has won a $9.2 billion (6.12 billion pounds) deal to supply engines for 50 A380 aircraft for Dubai’s Emirates airline [EMIRA.UL], the largest order in its history and giving it a boost after a torrid year of profit warnings.
Shares in the British company rose an initial 2 percent after Friday’s announcement, which Rolls-Royce said was the biggest order placed with a British company outside the defence sector.
It is the first time the Gulf carrier has ordered Rolls-Royce engines for its superjumbo fleet, the rest of which is powered by Engine Alliance, a joint venture of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.
Announcing the deal at a press conference attended by Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rishton and Emirates President Tim Clark, the companies said the aircraft in question would enter service from 2016.
Though a shift in engine supplier is rare, the deal had been flagged by Clark in March, when he said he was considering Rolls-Royce engines for the aircraft. The selection could raise hopes that Rolls will win more orders from Emirates.
Emirates, the leading buyer of the A380 jet with 140 orders, has said that if Airbus goes ahead with a revamp of its A380 superjumbo it would place a big order for that model.
Clark has said he expected any so-called A380neo to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines based on its Trent XWB engine.
“As far as the neo is concerned, we await the deliberations from Toulouse,” Clark told reporters on Friday, referring to Airbus headquarters.
Rolls-Royce was also awaiting Airbus’s decision on the A380 upgrade, the CEO said. “We have said that if they do, we will support that. We think that we can find a business case for it.”
The contract signed on Friday for the classic A380 includes a long-term “Totalcare” package, which means Rolls-Royce will also provide service and maintenance to Emirates.
Rolls-Royce is the world’s second-largest maker of aeroengines after GE, but its outlook has been hit by cancelled orders in other parts of its business, where it makes power systems for the oil and gas, marine and industrial sectors.
It warned in February that profits this year could fall by as much as 13 percent, on top of an 8 percent drop last year, saying the low oil price had increased uncertainty.
In its aerospace division, the company is in the throes of a cost-cutting programme, aiming to shed 2,600 jobs to try to improve profitability. Rishton said the new order would help secure jobs but the 2,600 planned cuts would still go ahead.

Tesco sales rise shows tentative recovery continues,Tesco,0.256,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-grocers-kantar-idUKKBN0MZ0O020150408,www.reuters.com,Tesco sales rise shows tentative recovery continues,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sales at Britain's biggest retailer Tesco TSCO.L edged higher over the last three months, industry data showed on Wednesday, adding to signs of a tentative recovery in the supermarket's fortunes under its new boss. 
Market share figures from researchers Kantar Worldpanel also showed discounter Aldi overtaking upmarket chain Waitrose to become Britain’s sixth-largest supermarket by sales.
The rise of Aldi and fellow discounter Lidl has been a major thorn in Tesco’s side in recent years.
Since joining in September, new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis has been fighting back by cutting prices, increasing product availability, cutting queues and improving stores.
Kantar Worldpanel said Tesco’s sales rose 0.3 percent in the 12 weeks to March 29.
That increase, which followed data last month showing Tesco’s strongest sales performance in 18 months, helped the supermarket to almost halt its market share decline. Its share was down only two tenths of a percentage point to 28.4 percent compared with last year.
Shares in Tesco are down 11 percent year-on-year, but are up a third so far this year on recovery hopes. The stock was down 1.3 pence to 250 pence at 1003 GMT, valuing the business at 20.5 billion pounds ($30.6 billion).
Lewis is also cutting costs and selling assets to mend Tesco’s finances and fight back from years of declining market share, debt-rating downgrades and an accounting scandal.
The firm reports 2014-15 results on April 22 when it is expected to post a third straight fall in annual profit.
Of Tesco's major rivals, Sainsbury's SBRY.L saw a sales increase of 0.2 percent in the three-month period, its first growth since August 2014.
However, Asda and Morrisons MRW.L recorded sales declines of 1.1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.
Asda, the British arm of U.S. group Wal-Mart WMT.N, in particular appears to have been affected by Tesco's improvement.
Aldi and Lidl’s sales rose 16.8 percent and 12.1 percent respectively, taking their market shares to 5.3 percent and 3.7 percent.
Aldi’s growth has been fuelled by over half a million new shoppers choosing to visit this year and average basket sizes increasing by 7 percent, Kantar said, though it added that sales growth for the discounters had slowed in recent months.
Aldi has an expansion plan which will see it double in size, reaching 1,000 stores by 2022.
Britain’s overall grocery market grew 1.0 percent over the period, Kantar said. Grocery inflation was down 2.0 percent, reflecting the impact of Aldi and Lidl and the market’s competitive response, as well as deflation in some major categories including vegetables, milk, eggs and bread.

"Whitbread Profit Up As Sales Continue To Rise, Looking For New CEO",Whitbread,0.385,https://www.reuters.com/article/whitbread-results-idUKL5N0VZ17F20150225,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Premier Inn owner Whitbread upbeat on profit as sales climb,"(Adds detail, comment)
LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Britain’s Whitbread expects to post full-year profit towards the top of market forecasts after strong demand at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee chain helped to deliver a 5.8 percent rise in like-for-like fourth-quarter sales.
The group, which also runs pubs such as Brewers Fayre, said on Wednesday that strong demand throughout the country had pushed like-for-like sales up 8.6 percent at Premier Inn, with group revenue per available room -- a key industry measure -- up 8.9 percent and occupancy for the year at a record high.
Same-store sales at UK Costa stores rose 6.9 percent in the 11 weeks to Feb. 12, Whitbread’s financial fourth quarter.
“Premier Inn and Costa continue to grow rapidly, winning UK market share, with Premier Inn also benefiting from the recovery in the UK regional hotel market,” Whitbread Chief Executive Andy Harrison said.
Analysts had forecast Whitbread’s 2014/15 pretax profit in a range of 437 million pounds ($679 million) to 495 million pounds, with the average estimate at 472 million pounds, according to Reuters data.
Shares in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which have risen 22 percent over the past year, gained 2 percent to 52.05 pounds in early trade on Wednesday.
Whitbread has grown rapidly in recent years on demand from cost-conscious customers for affordable hotels and a trend for takeaway coffee, with an improving British economy now providing added momentum.
To capitalise, the group wants to expand Premier Inn to 75,000 rooms by 2018, up from about 56,700, and to double Costa’s sales to 2 billion pounds through expansion at home and abroad, particularly in China.
Whitbread said that 5,500 hotel rooms would be added this financial year, against 4,500 in 2014/15, with net new Costa stores rising from 230 to 250 worldwide.
The company said that capital investment would rise to 700 million pounds, from 575 million pounds in 2014/15, as it strengthens its freehold hotel pipeline, particularly in London.
Some analysts expect Whitbread to demerge Costa, which has about 1,750 British stores and 1,100 more overseas and has been valued at around 3 billion pounds. However, Harrison told Reuters that the group remains focused on expanding the chain.
“Costa will continue to create very substantial shareholder value through profitable growth, and that’s what we are concentrating on,” he said. ($1 = 0.6440 pounds)

Glencore blames rivals for creating metals glut,Glencore,-0.331,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-glencore-agm-idUKKBN0NS1BJ20150507,www.reuters.com,Glencore blames rivals for creating metals glut,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of global mining and trading company Glencore GLEN.L said rivals were to blame for an oversupply of metals which depressed its share price.
Despite a partial recovery in the last few months, Glencore’s shares are down about 6 percent from a year ago, under pressure from a rout in prices for most of the commodities it produces and trades.
“Unfortunately our competitors in the world have produced more supply than demand and commodity prices are down for that reason,” Glasenberg said at the company’s annual meeting.
“I am doing my level best to convince my competitors we should understand the words demand and supply,” he added in response to a question from an investor about the share price.
Glasenberg has criticised rivals such as Rio Tinto RIO.L and BHP Billiton BLT.LBHP.AX at various times, blaming them for oversupplying the market, particularly in iron ore, a commodity Glencore has little exposure to.
Glasenberg said he was optimistic about the outlook for its key products: copper, nickel and zinc.
Coal, another main commodity for Glencore, also “looks good going forward”, Glasenberg said, as Indonesia exports taper off with the country consuming more coal domestically.
Coal prices have been battered by a large supply overhang in the last couple of years.
Glasenberg has said unlike his rivals he would not aim to “cannibalise” his own market by adding to the glut.
The world’s largest exporter of thermal coal said in March that its 2015 coal output was expected to fall by around 6 percent on the year after production cuts at some of its coal operations.
But London-listed Glencore’s coal output rose by 4 percent in the first quarter this year from the same period a year ago.
In January the company said it could shut down production destined for export from its Optimum Coal Mines in South Africa, which would put 1,070 jobs at risk.
In reply to a shareholder who asked the company to prevent such a blow to the country, South Africa-born Glasenberg said if the company goes ahead with the Optimum closure it would expand capacity at another lower cost South African mine.
“So the net net effect should be the same but (would) just provide more benefit for shareholders, more benefit for the country, larger taxes being paid,” he said.

* Cash return was planned after Novartis asset swap deal
* GSK to showcase reshaped business at May 6 investor day
LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline may ditch a plan to return 4 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) to investors, some analysts believe, as the drugmaker prepares to set out its vision for the reshaped group and a new chairman takes the helm.
Instead, Britain’s biggest drugmaker could use cash flowing in from its far-reaching asset swap deal with Novartis to support its dividend, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs and Berenberg Bank.
GSK said last year it intended to return 4 billion pounds to shareholders in 2015 through a so-called B share scheme, following its $20 billion-plus transaction with Novartis, which was finalised two months ago.
But with the drugmaker’s dividend under pressure following several years of stagnant growth, some believe it might make more sense to cancel the programme.
“Momentum behind this capital return seems to have stalled,” Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note on Friday. “With the dividend commitment under pressure, we think there is now a credible possibility the company will cancel the capital return in favour of supporting the dividend.”
Scrapping the cash return could cut earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 3-4 percent. But this would be offset by renewed confidence in the dividend, which offers a fat yield of 5 percent.
While the company has promised that this year’s dividend will be held at 2014’s level of 80 pence a share, there are concerns about the outlook for 2016.
“Importantly, in the context of dividend yield, we believe that if GSK were to sacrifice the B share scheme, greater certainty on the dividend in 2016 and beyond might be well received by investors,” Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.
A GSK spokesman said it was company policy never to comment on market speculation.
The debate comes as Chief Executive Andrew Witty prepares to detail prospects for the new-look GSK at an investor day on May 6, when it will also announce first-quarter results. The company’s annual meeting a day later will see new chairman Philip Hampton take over.
GSK has sold its cancer drugs portfolio to Novartis, while at the same time boosting its consumer health business through a joint venture with the Swiss company and buying Novartis’s vaccines.
This reduces GSK’s reliance on risky drug development and increases its exposure to more stable consumer and vaccines operations, both of which have long-lasting products but, in the case of consumer health, lower margins.

* Appetite for equities knocked by global bond sell-off
* Airline easyJet sees disappointing Q3 outlook
EDINBURGH, May 12 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index fell sharply on Monday, led lower by a slump in easyJet, with the appetite for equities knocked by a global bond sell-off, ensuring that optimism after a decisive British election result was short-lived.
Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 64.64 points, or 0.9 percent, at 6,965.21, but remained up 1 percent since the start of Friday, when markets rallied after an unexpected Conservative majority in the election.
Although the market remains well clear of recent lows, focus has switched away from domestic politics, with markets across Europe all more than a percent lower as a global bond sell-off resumed.
The sell-off has surprised investors and puzzled analysts since the end of April. While analysts have said the sell-off was partly triggered by an uptick in inflation expectations, yields continue to rise despite oil prices dipping and renewed worries over Greece.
“This is having a major impact on the other asset classes, and the volatility spills over into equity futures ... Risk managers are looking at decreasing their levels of risk, given the moves,” Ioan Smith, managing director of KCG Europe, said.
“When you’ve got this sort of volatility in something like the Bund, which is considered a safe haven asset, you have to question the functioning of the market more broadly.”
The sell-off on the FTSE was broad based, with 92 out of 100 stocks in negative territory.
Leading the fallers was easyJet after the low-cost airline struck a cautious tone over outlook, dropping 7.8 percent.
The airline warned it would take a hit from air traffic strikes in April, and said that revenue per seat would fall in the third quarter despite turning a profit in the weaker winter seasons for the first time.
“There are pluses and minuses in the statement but we are trimming our full year PBT forecast from 691 million pounds to 660 million pounds, primarily to reflect 25 million pounds of disruption costs in April (French air traffic control),” analysts at Numis write in a note.
“We would expect the share to give up a little of its recent performance today, but strategically we believe that easyJet continues to be well placed for growth.”

Imperial Tobacco Adds Quarterly Dividends After Profit Rose,Imperial Tobacco,0.336,https://www.reuters.com/article/imperial-tobacco-results-idUSL6N0SU11L20141104,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 2-Imperial Tobacco pledges 10 percent dividend increase,"* Raised dividend by 10 pct, pledges same or better in 2015
* Revenue, profit miss analysts’ average estimates
* Shares up 3 pct (Recasts with analyst, background, byline)
LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Imperial Tobacco Group said it would raise its dividend by at least 10 percent in the next year, signalling confidence that cost cuts will help it to cope with weak consumer spending and higher taxes that weighed on its annual profit.
Like all tobacco companies, Imperial has been grappling with declining sales in a number of markets, as more people cut back or quit smoking. In addition, weak economies and government tax increases are making cigarettes less affordable, leading to lower-priced brands gaining in popularity.
Imperial, whose brands include Davidoff and Gauloises, has tackled this by cutting costs, including closing factories, resulting in more than 60 million pounds ($95.95 million) of savings in the year to Sept. 30. It said it was on track to save 300 million pounds each year by 2018.
The company also recently floated a portion of its logistics business, Logista, on the Spanish stock exchange, raising 395 million pounds which it used to pay down debt. At the end of its financial year, its net down was down 11 percent to 8.1 billion pounds.
Imperial Tobacco said it expected to raise its dividend by at least 10 percent for its new financial year (2014/15), following a 10 percent increase for the year to September 30.
RBC Capital Markets analysts said the dividend goal was “a signal of Imperial’s confidence in its debt trajectory.”
The company’s shares were up 3 percent at 2,747 pence at 1116 GMT on Tuesday, the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index , illustrating the attraction of large tobacco firms and their generous dividends in times of choppy markets.
Shares of larger rival British American Tobacco were up about 1.3 percent, while the FTSE 100 index was about flat.
The world’s fourth-largest international tobacco company said net revenue in its tobacco business fell 6 percent to 6.58 billion pounds in the fiscal year. As of Oct. 10, analysts on average were expecting 6.97 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Excluding foreign exchange rates and the impact of a stock optimisation programme that intentionally reduced inventories in several markets, underlying revenue rose 2 percent.
Volume, which measures the amount of tobacco sold, fell 4 percent, which the company said was in line with that of its overall markets.
Adjusted earnings per share fell 3 percent to 203.4 pence on a reported basis in the year, also missing analysts’ estimates of 214.2 pence per share, according to the consensus.
“Trading conditions remain tough in many territories but the actions we’ve taken to enhance the quality and sustainability of the business have put us in a stronger position to drive growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders,” Chief Executive Alison Cooper said.
The company is set to acquire the Maverick and Salem brands, and blu, the leading U.S. e-cigarette brand, for $7.1 billion to ease passage of Reynolds American’s $27.4 billion purchase of Lorillard. (1 US dollar = 0.6254 British pound) (Editing by Mark Potter and Jane Merriman)

SABMiller buys Meantime to quench thirst for craft beer,SABMiller,0.296,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-meantime-m-a-sab-idUSKBN0O016320150515,www.reuters.com,SABMiller buys Meantime to quench thirst for craft beer,"LONDON (Reuters) - SABMiller SAB.L is buying Britain's Meantime Brewing Company, swallowing up one of the pioneers of the country's craft brewing movement to give the owner of big brands such as Peroni and Grolsch exposure to a fast-growing part of the drinks market.
A surge in demand for craft beers in recent years has stolen market share from the world's two biggest brewers, SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR, as drinkers seek new tastes and support niche, local suppliers.
Sales volumes of Meantime’s beers including London Pale Ale and London Lager soared 58 percent in 2014, compared with a 1 percent rise in Britain’s beer market as a whole. The more richly flavored craft beer also sells at a premium to standard lager, another draw for SABMiller.
However, some supporters of craft beer say brands such as Meantime, which was founded in 1999 with the backing of a group of friends in a former tramshed in Greenwich, south London, risk losing their appeal if they sell out to a global brewer.
“I probably won’t be drinking Meantime anymore,” said Jeff Rosenmeier, founder of the Lovibonds craft brewery in Henley-on-Thames, southern England, though he conceded most drinkers wouldn’t notice and only “beer geeks” would turn away from it.
“Lame, lame, lame,” wrote one craft beer fan on Twitter, while another said “Goodbye to a indie brewery success story”.
Meantime chief executive Nick Miller, who joined from SABMiller in 2011, rejected the criticism.
“Why would Meantime suddenly not become a craft beer just because it’s got a different set of shareholders?” he asked on a call with reporters.
“Are you telling me that shareholders determine whether you’re craft or not? Surely it’s about the liquid, the beers that you produce, and the passion that you have for producing beer?”
Meantime’s founder Alastair Hook, its brew master, and Miller will continue to be part of Meantime following completion of the deal, expected in early June.
SABMiller said it aimed to grow sales of Meantime’s beers across Britain and use its distribution networks to export it to other markets in Europe.
AB InBev bought Goose Island, a U.S. craft beer brand, in 2011, and in the past year acquired craft names Blue Point and 10 Barrels, prompting a backlash on social media, with the three brands featuring on the website “Craftbeerblacklist”.
SABMiller’s U.S. joint venture with Molson Coors, MillerCoors, already sells Blue Moon in that country, another beer that plays in the craft beer category, although it has also faced some criticism.
Despite that, analysts welcomed SABMiller’s expansion into a fast-growing market.
“The variety of styles added to SAB’s extensive local and heritage beer menu should serve it well,” Accendo Market’s Mike van Dulken said.
SABMiller shares were up 1.2 percent at 3,644 pence at 1120 GMT (7.20 a.m. ET), within a UK blue-chip index up 0.3 percent .FTSE.
The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but will be small in the context of SABMiller’s market capitalization of 58 billion pounds ($91 billion). SABMiller sold 245 million hectolitres of lager in 2014, compared with Meantime’s annual capacity for production of 120,000 hectolitres.

* Kingfisher and Sports Direct reports bolster retail
* Miners weaker as Goldman sees cartel as unlikely
LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index edged higher on Thursday, led by retailers after Sports Direct raised its full-year earnings and profit outlook and Kingfisher reported a rise in retail profit.
Britain’s biggest sporting goods retailer Sports Direct rose 4.6 percent, the top gainer in the FTSE 100 index , after raising its outlook, citing lower interest charges and what it described as a prudent depreciation policy.
Europe’s biggest home retail company Kingfisher followed, up 3.3 percent after reporting a rise in first-quarter retail profit, helped by a strong performance at Screwfix which lifted sales at the group’s British arm.
“UK wage growth has started to pick up and shopping has been boosted by low inflation. Consumers now have more money in their pockets to spend on general merchandise,” said Edmund Shing, global equity fund manager at BCS Asset Management.
Adding to the bullish picture, British consumer confidence surged this month to its highest level in a year as more households expected their finances to improve in the coming 12 months, a survey showed on Thursday.
The FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent at 7,046.37 points by 1050 GMT. Gains were capped by weaker miners, which fell 0.4 percent.
The sector is down 9 percent since May 5 as copper prices have dropped to a four-week low. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said overnight that major iron ore miners were unlikely to create a cartel and agree on output cuts to shore up prices.
“Goldman Sachs said that they don’t see a cartel in the sector ... so in the grand scheme of things, metal prices are weak, (and) without a cartel look set to remain weak,” said David Madden, market analyst at IG.
“Demand for the underlying minerals looks weak, and the supply side looks set to keep the pressure up on these stocks as well.”
Product-testing firm Intertek Group was the blue-chip index’s top loser, falling 1.5 percent to 2,538 pence, after Deutsche Bank cut its stance to “hold” from “buy” and lowered its price target to 2,654 pence from 2,725 pence. (Additional reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Catherine Evans)

It also scrapped plans to float its HIV drug business ViiV Healthcare, citing its strong outlook.
Chief Executive Andrew Witty is under pressure to prove to investors that a $20 billion-plus asset swap with Novartis can revive GSK’s fortunes, following a damaging slide in lung drug sales and a major corruption scandal in China.
Britain’s biggest drugmaker said it expected group sales to rise by a low-to-mid single digit percentage rate annually to 2020. Its pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer health businesses would increase annual sales by low single digits, mid-to-high single digits and mid single digits respectively, it added.
In a bid to protect its dividend, GSK also said it was scaling back plans to return 4 billion pounds ($6 billion) of cash flowing from the Novartis transaction to investors and would instead pay 1 billion as a special dividend.
GSK is showcasing its new divisional structure at an investor day, alongside first-quarter results, which showed a fall in earnings per share, hit by declining sales and prices for its profitable Advair lung drug in the United States.
Quarterly sales were 5.62 billion pounds, unchanged from a year earlier in sterling terms. Core earnings per share (EPS) - the measure followed most closely by investors - were down 18 percent at 17.3 pence.
Analysts, on average, had forecast sales of 5.62 billion pounds and core EPS, which excludes certain items, of 17.4 pence, according to Thomson Reuters.

"UPDATE 3-BP settles oil spill-related claims with Halliburton, Transocean",BP,-0.121,https://www.reuters.com/article/halliburton-bp-oilspill-idINL3N0YB5AA20150521,www.reuters.com,"UPDATE 3-BP settles oil spill-related claims with Halliburton, Transocean","(Adds statement from plaintiffs’ attorneys)
May 20 (Reuters) - BP Plc has settled with oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and contract driller Transocean Ltd cross claims related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history.
BP still faces a potential fine of up to $13.7 billion under the U.S. Clean Water Act.
Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig, had settled its Clean Water Act liability for $1 billion. The U.S. government never sued Halliburton under the Act, one person familiar with the case said.
“We have now settled all matters relating to the accident with both our partners in the well and our contractors,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in an email.
Transocean said BP would pay the company $125 million in compensation for legal fees it incurred, adding the companies will mutually release all claims against each other.
The company added BP will also discontinue its attempts to recover as an “additional insured” under Transocean’s liability policies that will accelerate the company’s recovery of about $538 million in insurance claims.
Transocean also said it would pay about $212 million to a fund set up to pay out claims to people and businesses harmed by the spill, subject to the approval by U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
“We applaud Transocean for adding to the settlement funds established in the Halliburton settlement to help compensate people and businesses for their losses,” said co-lead plaintiffs’ attorneys, Stephen Herman and James Roy.
Transocean said it intends to make the payments using cash on hand.
In September, a U.S. judge ruled that BP was mostly at fault and that Transocean and Halliburton were not as much to blame.
Halliburton, which did the cementing work for BP’s well, had earlier blamed BP’s decision to use only six centralizers for the blowout that spilled millions of barrels of oil for 87 days.
Halliburton said in September that it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in the oil spill.
London-based BP has already taken $43.8 billion in pretax charges for clean-up and other costs. (Reporting by Anannya Pramanick and Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru and Terry Wade in Houston; Editing by Don Sebastian and Lisa Shumaker)

May 13 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor Corp said it offered to buy Integrated Silicon Solution Inc for $19.75 per share in cash, trumping an offer by a Chinese consortium led by Summitview Capital.
Cypress’s cash offer values Integrated Silicon Solution at $627.3 million, based on about 31.8 million shares outstanding as of May 1, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The offer is at a 5.4 percent premium to the stock’s Wednesday close.
If the deal goes through, it will help Cypress continue to shift focus to automotive customers.
The company agreed to buy peer Spansion Inc for $1.59 billion in stock in December to help it shrug off weakness in the smartphone market.
Spansion’s microcontroller chips are used for everything from controlling airbag deployment in cars to rolling down windows.
“Cypress bought Spansion partly due to an explosion in the automotive sector and ISSI has about half its revenue coming from automotive today,” Craig Hallum analyst Richard Shannon told Reuters.
The Chinese consortium had agreed to buy Integrated Silicon for $19.25 per share in cash in March.
Integrated Silicon said in April that it would hold a special shareholder meeting on June 3 to consider the consortium’s proposal.
Integrated Silicon Solution’s shares rose 6.7 percent to $20 in after-market trading on Wednesday, while Cypress’ shares rose nearly 2 percent to $12.89. (Reporting by Kshitiz Goliya in Bengaluru; Editing by Joyjeet Das)

NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday ordered Nomura Holdings Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to pay a collective $806 million for making false statements in selling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan entered the judgment after finding the banks liable on Monday following a non-jury bench trial in a lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over securities sold ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.
Under the order, Fannie Mae will receive $26.6 million while Freddie Mac will be paid $779.4 million by the two firms.
The damages amount was in line with an estimate given to Reuters on Tuesday by a lawyer for the FHFA, which has acted as conservator for Fannie and Freddie since their 2008 government takeover.
While RBS was ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, Nomura has agreed to an indemnify the bank, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banks also under the order will receive back the mortgage bonds the FHFA sued over, which a defense expert witness at trial estimated were worth $434 million to $479 million as of March 26.
Nomura in a statement said it will appeal, saying it “takes this situation very seriously and strongly disagrees with the outcome of the case.”
Representatives for the FHFA and RBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit was the first of 18 to reach trial filed by the regulator in 2011 over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The FHFA has obtained nearly $17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG. Those deals followed adverse rulings by Cote.
Following a non-jury trial, Cote ruled against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals.
“The offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans,” Cote wrote. “The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous.”

* Land Securities rises after hiking dividend
* Vodafone falls on cautious outlook - traders (Updates with closing prices)
LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index rose on Tuesday, led by Land Securities which raised its dividend payout and helped offset a drop in heavily weighted miners and telecoms firm Vodafone.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 26.23 points, or 0.4 percent at 6,995.10 points at the close. The index has gained nearly 7 percent so far this year.
Shares in Land Securities rose 4 percent, one of the biggest FTSE 100 gains, after Britain’s largest listed property developer hiked its dividend by 3.7 percent, saying a boom in demand for commercial property had boosted its net asset value by 27.6 percent in the year ended March 31.
“Land Securities numbers were good and highlight that the office space market will continue to improve with a further pickup in the economy. The company will benefit from a rise in the rental demand,” Securequity trader Jawaid Afsar said.
Bottler Coca Cola HBC was the top riser, gaining 4.3 percent after Barclays lifted its target price to 1220 pence from 1175 pence following above expectation earnings reported last week.
Gains in the broader stock market were capped by a drop in miners after prices of key industrial metals fell. The UK mining index was down 2.5 percent.
BHP Billiton dropped 3.9 percent after J.P. Morgan cut its target price for the stock to 1,425 pence from 1,600 pence.
The FTSE 100 performed less strongly than continental European indexes, with analysts attributing much of its underperformance to its heavy weighting in mining stocks.
The materials sector, including miners, trimmed over 11 points off the FTSE 100.
“We see no near-term catalyst for an improvement in the outlook for metal prices,” said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, market analyst at Charles Stanley, adding that he had a preference for euro zone shares over Britain’s blue chips.
“The pressure is still on the mining sector... and UK shares look comparatively less attractive than other places.”
Among top individual decliners, Vodafone fell 3.2 percent as some traders said the mobile network operator’s guidance had been slightly below expectations, even though Vodafone returned to quarterly sales growth.
“Vodafone ... delivered a more cautious outlook than expected as it presses ahead with network investment to increase both speed and coverage and reduce customer churn,” Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.
“It would appear that the prospect of further network investment being required to offset squeezed consumers is weighing on expectations.” (Editing by Alison Williams/Ruth Pitchford)

* Mondi shares advances after strong profits
* Barratt up on positive outlook
LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index rose in early trading on Wednesday, with housebuilder Barratt Developments, South African paper maker Mondi and other companies gaining after encouraging updates.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent at 6,982.59 points by 0801 GMT after falling 1.4 percent in the previous session. It is up about 6 percent so far this year.
Mondi shares rose 9 percent, the top gainer in the FTSE 100 index, after the company said its first quarter underlying operating profit was 29 percent above the comparable period last year.
“Average paper selling prices holding up and comparable sales growth across most business, both sequentially and annually, is also welcome news at this stage of the year,” Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said.
“Its confidence in FY progress is going down well with the investment community this early in the year when other corporates are possibly more cautious,” he added.
Barratt Developments advanced 3.4 percent after Britain’s biggest housebuilder by volume said it expected to build more houses this year than previously forecast, thanks to strong demand and rising sales.
Among sectoral gainers, the UK Oil and Gas index rose 0.6 percent, tracking a rise in crude oil prices supported by bets that U.S. crude stockpiles will fall for a second straight week.
But gains were capped by some weaker stocks. Compass Group fell 2.2 percent after the world’s biggest catering firm said it remained cautious over the economic environment in some emerging markets. It, however, reaffirmed its full-year expectations.
“No news with regards to a new share buy-back scheme looks to be generating some early disappointment,” Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said.
“Furthermore, challenges for its emerging markets business continue to be navigated, with some increased economic uncertainty and the impact of lower commodity prices on Offshore & Remote client operations providing some drag on performance.”
Admiral Group fell 1.2 percent after the insurer said that Henry Engelhardt had decided to step down from his role as chief executive in one year’s time and he would be replaced by co-founder and current Admiral chief operating officer David Stevens. (Editing by Andrew Heavens)

The newspaper reported that the two sides opened talks last month and discussions were still at an early stage.

Severn may be more susceptible to a bid now, the newspaper said citing sources close to the situation, as the industry regulator has imposed tighter profit rules for the next five years and the company has also had a change of chief executive.

New Morrisons duo get former boss's support to diffuse investor tension,Morrisons,0.143,https://www.reuters.com/article/morrison-supermk-agm-idUSL5N0YQ26Z20150604,www.reuters.com,New Morrisons duo get former boss's support to diffuse investor tension,"BRADFORD, England, June 4 (Reuters) - The new management of British food retailer Morrisons got support on Thursday from the company’s former boss Ken Morrison to help to diffuse tensions at its shareholder meeting over pay and strategy.
In March, Morrisons reported its lowest profit in eight years and said it would cut its dividend. In common with rivals Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s it is battling record food price deflation and waging a price war to stem the loss of shoppers to discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Chief Executive David Potts and Chairman Andrew Higginson received the public backing of Morrison at the meeting. He is the 83-year-old son of the grocer’s founder, who ran the company for half a century before stepping down in 2008.
Last year, Morrison had used the company’s annual meeting to lambast previous CEO Dalton Philips and to decry his strategy.
“It’s a big job to restore the company’s fortunes, please be patient and give management some breathing space,” Morrison told investors at Thursday’s meeting in a marked change of tone.
Potts and Higginson used their first annual meeting to tell shareholders they would review the company’s pay policies in light of a large payout given to Philips, who was ousted in January.
The two, both former senior executives at rival Tesco, adopted a more conciliatory approach after previous annual meetings turned into heated affairs.
Higginson said it looked like voters would approve the company’s remuneration report but said in light of a significant vote against it, they would review future policies.
He also noted concerns about Philips’ leaving package, which including payoff, bonus, salary and other benefits totalled more than 3 million pounds ($4.6 million), and said this was the minimum that could be paid under his contract.
Potts has taken steps to get Morrison onside. The former boss told Reuters last month that Potts has sought his counsel and the pair have toured stores together.
Morrison told the meeting on Thursday he had recommended to Potts that some former colleagues return to the company.
Morrison’s wider family own about 10 percent of the retail group’s equity.

It also said on Wednesday it had decided to retain full ownership of its Nordics business and would not pursue a partial initial public offering (IPO).
The group, which trades as Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse in Britain, has benefited from people working from home and buying equipment online.
Its shares were up 2% at 0911 GMT, extending year-on-year gains to 40%.
""We are seeing tech being much more important, three quarters of our customers say they're leaning more on technology than they ever have before,"" Chief Executive Alex Baldock said.
""You've got trends like hybrid working and home entertainment, with gaming now a bigger market than both music and movies combined,"" he told reporters.
Dixons Carphone reported an adjusted pretax profit of 156 million pounds ($216 million) for the year to May 1, topping guidance of 151 million pounds and the 116 million it earned in 2019-20. It came after it repaid government staff furlough support of 73 million pounds but not business rates relief.
The group proposed a full-year dividend of 3.0 pence.
Revenue rose 2% to 10.3 billion pounds, with like-for-like sales of electricals up 14% despite stores in the UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark and Greece being shut for substantial periods.
Electricals online sales more than doubled to 4.7 billion pounds, more than offsetting a 55% fall in sales in the loss-making Britain and Ireland mobile division, which has closed standalone Carphone Warehouse stores.

Standard Chartered STAN.L rose 5.8 percent, with traders citing the possibility that British finance minister George Osborne might announce changes in a tax on the British banking industry when he speaks later on Wednesday.
Any move to re-focus the tax on the UK balance sheets of global banks would benefit Standard Chartered, since the bulk of its business is conducted outside Britain, traders said.
“Stan Chart has guided to a $540 million levy this year (340 million pounds), so changing the levy to UK-only balance sheets would be very beneficial,” said Mike Trippitt, director of banks equity research at Numis Securities.
Traders were also encouraged by new Chief Executive Bill Winters, who told staff on his first day the bank must strengthen its finances and simplify operations to boost returns.
Sainsbury shares rose 4.5 percent. The company reported a sixth straight quarter of declining underlying sales, but some analysts said the company had beat expectations. “Short” positions in supermarket stocks indicated much of the market was positioned for disappointing numbers.
“Even at these levels, Sainsbury’s profitability will be significantly better than its listed peers ... we continue to believe that Sainsbury is the best placed amongst the three listed supermarkets,” Brewin Dolphin equity analyst Nicla Di Palma said in a note.
Sainsbury's rise pulled up the shares of rivals such as Tesco TSCO.L and Morrison MRW.L. Negative bets against British supermarket stocks are at record highs, according to the financial information firm Markit, and stocks can be squeezed upwards when these positions are closed.

Johnson Matthey JMAT.L, the world's largest maker of auto catalysts, shed 5.3 percent, making it the top FTSE 100 faller.
The company posted a small rise in annual profit helped by higher sales of catalysts in Europe, but investors worried about an unexpectedly sharp increase in debt caused by a rise in working capital and weaker precious metals prices, which have hit its metals division in the last year.
“Rising car sales in Europe and tighter regulation on fuel discharges drove profits higher, but the dreary outlook for the metal business has put pressure on the stock,” David Madden, a market analyst at IG, said in a note.

“If we look across developed markets, sell-off in equities is pretty broad. To me, it’s probably more to do with monetary policy than anything else,” said James Butterfill, global equity strategist at Coutts.
The European Central Bank’s insistence on Wednesday that there was no need to adjust monetary policy in the face of volatility rattled financial markets. <GVD/EUR FRX/>
The sell-off on the FTSE was broad-based, with all sectors in negative territory.
Many of the top fallers traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts, with National Grid NG.L and WPP WPP.L dropping 5.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.
Commodity stocks were also weaker, with gold pinned near a three-year low and further downside to metal prices seen. [MET/L] [GOL/]

UPDATE 3-Stifel to buy former Lehman brokerage from Barclays,Lehman,0.164,https://www.reuters.com/article/barclayswealth-stifel-financial-ma-idUSL3N0YU45G20150608,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 3-Stifel to buy former Lehman brokerage from Barclays,"(Adds analyst quotes, updates shares)
June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Stifel Financial Corp said on Monday it would buy Barclays Plc’s U.S. wealth and investment management unit, which is largely made up of the former brokerage arm of Lehman Brothers.
The deal value was not disclosed, but Barclays said the sale would have minimal financial impact. (bit.ly/1F3YltV)
Stifel is hoping to bring on board the unit’s 180 advisers, who manage about $56 billion from offices in 12 cities.
This compares inauspiciously with the 250-300 advisers that Barclays executives said were working a year ago. A spokesman declined to specify historic numbers.
Depending on the number of advisers who ultimately join Stifel, the deal could contribute $200-$325 million to revenue, Stifel Chief Executive Ron Kruszewski said on a conference call.
Kruszewski has paid relatively low prices to buy companies in the past, but often provides generous packages to retain their employees.
In talking up the complimentary “entrepreneurial” cultures of the firms during the call, Kruszewski appeared to be speaking as much to Barclays brokers as to the financial community.
Stifel will be allowed to exclusively sell certain Barclays-underwritten stock and bond offerings to retail investors, a major business of many of the Barclays brokers.
“At the mid-point of guidance, it appears this transaction could be double digit percent accretive to 2016 EPS,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Christopher Harris wrote in a note, but he added that this depended on adviser retention.
St. Louis-based Stifel, a once low-key firm specializing in municipal bonds, is now a national presence serving individual investors and middle-market companies.
Kruszewski, who became CEO in 1997, has bought several, mostly troubled, retail brokerage and investment banking firms since 2005.
Stifel closed the acquisition of Alabama-based Sterne Agee Group for about $150 million on Friday. S&P Capital IQ analyst Ken Leon said Sterne Agee would likely generate $300-$325 million in revenue, raising his target price by $5 to $65.
Sources told Reuters in May that Barclays was reaching out to potential buyers for its U.S. wealth business.
Kruszewski said Stifel would cut costs by combining some back-office operations and closing branches where the firms have duplicate locations.
Stifel said it expected pretax margins of between 20-25 percent after amortization of retention, and that it would issue between 1 million and 2 million shares.
The deal is expected to close in November, Stifel said.
Stifel’s shares were up 0.7 percent at $57.45 in early afternoon trading. (Reporting by Richa Naidu in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Savio D’Souza and Ted Kerr)

LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index slipped to trade at three-month lows on Monday, in line with a broad sell-off in European equities, after Greece failed again to reach a deal with its creditors and moved closer to defaulting on its debts.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.8 percent at 6,729.77 points by 1457 GMT, extending the previous session’s losses of 0.9 percent.
It has lost some 5 percent in two weeks, also on the prospect that the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin a cycle of rate hikes from as early as September, but is still up 2.5 percent for the year.
Julia Kloeckner, a senior official in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats, said Greece was gambling too far and the patience of its creditors was running out.
“Are we approaching the end-game? It looks highly likely this time around. Greece has been a handy reason to clear out of stocks over the past few weeks, with Fed-related jumpiness also playing its part,” IG analyst Chris Beauchamp said.
Talks on ending a deadlock between Greece and its creditors broke up in failure on Sunday, with European leaders venting their frustration as Athens stumbled closer towards a debt default that threatens its future in the euro.
European Union officials blamed the collapse on Athens, saying it had failed to offer anything new to secure the funding it needs to repay 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund by the end of this month.
Among individual sharp movers, easyJet fell 1.7 percent after RBC cut its stance on the stock to “underperform” from “outperform”.
“Our positive outlook for easyJet’s summer has proved incorrect ... As summer is key, we see few positive catalysts until mid-2016 while easyJet faces a winter squeeze,” RBC analysts said in a note.
Also denting the sentiment around the budget airline and its peers were reports of new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which could sap enthusiasm for travel. South Korea’s Health Ministry reported five new cases of MERS on Monday, taking the total to 150.
Also among the top decliners, Standard Chartered dropped 2.5 percent after Jefferies cut its target price to 656 pence from 722 pence.
Outside the blue chips, Dragon Oil rose 8.5 percent after the Turkmenistan-focused oil explorer said it had agreed improved takeover terms with Emirates National Oil Co (ENOC), which increased its offer to buy out the minority shareholders. Dragon Oil said ENOC had increased its offer to 750 pence in cash per share, valuing the business at around 3.7 billion pounds. (Editing by Alison Williams)

UPDATE: Barclays Expects Gain After Settling With Lehman Bros Trustee,Barclays,0.199,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lehman-barclays-idUSKBN0OL1PY20150605,www.reuters.com,Barclays settles lawsuit over 2008 Lehman brokerage purchase,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barclays Plc BARC.L on Friday settled a long-running lawsuit by the trustee liquidating Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's brokerage unit, which arose from the bank's purchase of much of that unit at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis.
The trustee James Giddens said the unit, Lehman Brothers Inc, will pay Barclays about $1.28 billion, largely representing the value of margin assets not previously paid to the British bank, plus interest.
As a result, Barclays said it will have recouped all but $80 million still in dispute, plus $255 million tied to derivative investments that it expects to receive from third parties.
Barclays expects to record a roughly $750 million pre-tax gain when it next reports financial results on July 29.
The settlement would end six years of litigation by Giddens to recoup various assets he said totaled more than $7.6 billion.
It followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal on May 4 to hear his appeal of a lower court decision that upheld Barclays’ claim to $4 billion of disputed assets.
The settlement requires approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in Manhattan. She oversees the liquidations of the brokerage and its former parent, which had been Wall Street’s fourth-largest investment bank.
Barclays won bankruptcy court approval to buy much of the brokerage unit on Sept. 19, 2008, four days after the parent filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors.
Giddens said the settlement would free up $581 million he has held in reserve, plus $36 million held by the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, for distribution to creditors.
Roughly 111,000 former customers of the Lehman brokerage have already been paid more than $106 billion, and senior creditors have also been paid in full. Unsecured creditors have recouped $5.9 billion, or 27 percent of what they are owed.
“It has always been our duty to prudently and diligently pursue every avenue of recovery for assets we believe belong to the estate,” and the settlement “achieves the best result under the circumstances,” Giddens said in a statement.
Giddens chairs the bankruptcy practice at the law firm Hughes, Hubbard & Reed.
Lehman had $639 billion of assets when it filed Chapter 11. Its bankruptcy remains by far the biggest in U.S. history.
The case is In re: Lehman Brothers Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-ap-01420.

Petrofac books further ÃâÃÂ£30m cost for Shetland gas terminal delays,Petrofac,-0.343,https://www.reuters.com/article/petrofac-results-idINL4N0XH2M220150420,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 3-Petrofac expects further loss on Shetland project,"* Expects to take pretax loss of 130 mln stg
* Still expects to complete project in Q3, 2015
* Shares fall as much as 14 pct (Adds analyst, trader comments, updates shares)
April 20 (Reuters) - Petrofac Ltd said its loss on the Laggan-Tormore project in the Shetland Islands would now be larger than it expected, highlighting the hostile operating conditions and high costs faced by oil and gas developers in the North Sea.
The oilfield services provider’s shares fell as much as 14 percent on Monday on the London Stock Exchange.
The slump in global oil prices over the last 10 months has compounded the impact of high investment costs and the harsh climate in the North Sea region, prompting oil and gas companies to put billions of dollars of assets up for sale.
“Economic conditions are bad enough for North Sea oil and gas explorers and service providers, but the notorious stormy weather has made it worse for Petrofac...,” London Capital trader Lewis Sturdy said.
Petrofac, which has also faced delays at the Ithaca Energy-owned Greater Stella Area project in central North Sea, said it still expected to complete Laggan-Tormore in the third quarter, but would need to “expend significantly more man-hours.”
“I have never faced a more difficult and challenging work environment,” Chief Executive Ayman Asfari said.
Petrofac has been investing heavily in its offshore engineering and construction business, but has had to take losses on two key projects in the North Sea.
Canaccord Genuity analyst Alex Brooks said he was cautiously supportive of Petrofac’s investment in its deepwater construction capability.
Petrofac said it expected to incur 130 million pounds ($194.45 million) in pretax loss in 2015 on Laggan-Tormore, in addition to the $230 million it had recognised in February.
French oil major Total, which owns 80 percent of Laggan-Tormore, put its stake up for sale in March, seeking about $1.5 billion.
Laggan-Tormore is considered a high-quality oil and gas asset and is expected to reach peak production rates of about 93,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

CompaniesActelion shares hit record on Shire takeover talk,Actelion,0.721,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-actelion-m-a-shire-idUSKBN0ON0VH20150608,www.reuters.com,Swiss biotech Actelion hits record high on potential Shire bid,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Actelion ATLN.VX, Europe's biggest biotech company, jumped 10 percent to a record high on Monday after a report Shire SHP.L was considering a $19 billion takeover of the Swiss group to boost its rare diseases business.
Shire, which is based in Ireland but has most operations in the United States, is a serial acquirer in a consolidating healthcare sector, which has seen a record $253 billion of deals so far this year.
An informal approach by Shire was rebuffed several weeks ago by Actelion, according to Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper, citing unidentified financial industry sources.
Shire was willing to pay 160 Swiss francs a share for Actelion, the sources said, a 21 percent premium to Friday’s closing price. Shares in Actelion hit an all-time high of 144.5 francs on Monday.
Berenberg Bank analysts said Shire might have to offer 180-200 francs to get a deal done, adding its reported move would likely encourage others to come forward with offers.
A spokeswoman for Shire, whose shares fell 2 percent, told Reuters the company did not comment on speculation. An Actelion spokesman said it did not comment on market rumours.
Earlier this year, Actelion raised its full-year guidance after strong sales of its new heart and lung drug helped its first-quarter earnings exceed analysts’ estimates.
At the time, the company’s founder and chief executive Jean-Paul Clozel told Reuters it had not received any outside interest to buy the company.
Clozel has resisted past pressure from shareholders to consider a sale but Actelion’s position as a niche player in a high-margin segment of the drugs market has made it a persistent target of bid talk.
Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said Actelion would give Shire a further rare diseases growth engine, with extra upside from the Swiss firm’s late-stage pipeline in infectious diseases and multiple sclerosis.
Shire could also extract significant corporate overhead savings and use its existing sales force to market Actelion’s drugs for Gaucher and Fabry disease, two genetic disorders where Shire is strong.
But Parkes said Shire might have to offer a 30 percent plus premium to secure a deal, adding that any deal would require a mix of cash and equity.
Shire, which agreed to buy U.S. group NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in January, had net debt of $2.6 billion at the end of March and CEO Flemming Ornskov has shareholder approval to increase this to $12 billion if required.

Diageo Shares Surge on Report of Possible Takeover by Lemann,Lemann,0.415,https://www.reuters.com/article/diageo-stocks-idUKL5N0YU1PH20150608,www.reuters.com,Diageo shares surge on report of possible takeover interest,"LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Diageo Plc, the world’s largest spirits maker, rose about 7 percent on Monday following a report in the Brazilian press saying private equity firm 3G Capital was considering a bid for it.
Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann and his partners in 3G, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, are in the initial stages of studying a buyout offer for Diageo, the Veja newsweekly reported late on Friday, without saying how it obtained the information.
The three former investment bankers helped build up Anheuser Busch InBev into the world’s biggest brewer. They subsequently performed leveraged buyouts of Burger King and Heinz, and are now merging Heinz with Kraft Foods.
But a leveraged buyout of Diageo would be the largest in history and well beyond anything 3G has done, said Jefferies analysts, who estimated that the buyout firm would need to raise $73 billion in equity, assuming a 30 percent premium to Diageo’s stock price and 6 times leverage.
“What might be more likely is that 3G might be contemplating supporting a move for Diageo by AB InBev, in which Lemann and Telles have substantial stakes,” Jefferies said, adding that AB InBev might see synergies in selling beer and spirits.
Diageo, the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky, Tanqueray gin and Guinness beer declined to comment on the Brazilian report, which could not be independently verified.
A New York-based spokesman for 3G could not immediately be reached for comment outside of normal working hours.
Belgium-based AB InBev, which was also not immediately available to comment, does frequent acquisitions and has long been rumoured to be eyeing rival brewer SABMiller.
Diageo is smaller than SABMiller, making a deal more affordable, and would also offer margin enhancement opportunities through cost cuts, said Bernstein analysts, adding also that there are parts of Diageo that could be sold off to pay back debt.
Media reports earlier this year said Diageo was already considering the possible divestment of its Gleneagles Hotel for around 200 million pounds ($305 million) and its wine business.
Diageo shares were up 6.8 percent at 1880 pence at 0935 GMT.

By Liisa Tuhkanen
LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index rose for a second straight session on Wednesday after recent sharp falls, with Hikma Pharmaceuticals leading the market higher on positive broker comments and Barclays gaining after saying it will speed up cost cuts.
Hikma shares were the biggest blue-chip gainers after a target price update from Jefferies, adding 3.6 percent to the an 11.6 percent jump on Tuesday, when it announced a deal to buy Boehringer Ingelheim’s U.S. generic drugs business Roxane for about $2.65 billion in cash and stock.
“The deal has created a firm foundation for future growth,” Augustin Eden, analyst at Accendo Markets, said. “Hikma shares could be bound for a return to February highs and above - still a healthy 8.5 percent away despite gains of yesterday.”
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.4 percent at 6,580.32 points by 1029 GMT, after rising 0.8 percent in the previous session when it snapped a five-day losing streak.
Barclays shares rose 2 percent after the bank, which reported a 12 percent rise in profit, said it intended to accelerate the sale of assets and cost cutting.
“Barclays appears eager to press ahead with the increased pace of restructuring within the group. Most of the key metrics continue to show improvement, with a reduction in operating expenses and impairments being complemented by another robust income showing, leading to a notable hike in adjusted profits,” Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
“In addition, the capital cushion remains comfortable and the return on equity is showing some signs of life.”
British American Tobacco was up 2.7 percent after reporting a better-than-expected performance for the second quarter.
On the downside, Compass Group fell 4 percent after the world’s biggest catering firm said operating profit this year and next would be hit by restructuring costs.
Mid-cap engineering supply group Premier Farnell fell 16 percent following comments that it expected a 10 percent decline in first-half adjusted operating profit after sales growth per day in its main markets slowed in the second quarter.

Japan's Nikkei lands Financial Times in $1.3 billion deal,Nikkei,0.262,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pearson-m-a-financialtimes-idUSKCN0PX0YM20150723,www.reuters.com,Japan's Nikkei buys Financial Times in $1.3 billion deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese media group Nikkei has agreed to buy the Financial Times from Britain's Pearson PSON.L for $1.3 billion, putting one of the world's premier business newspapers in the hands of a company influential at home but little known outside Japan.
The deal, struck after Nikkei beat Germany's Axel Springer SPRGn.DE to the prize, marks the biggest acquisition by a Japanese media organization and is a coup for the employee-owned firm which lends its name to the main Japanese stock market index. 
In the Financial Times it has acquired an authoritative global newspaper that commands strong loyalty from its readers and has coped better than others with the shift to online publishing. It was one of the first newspapers to successfully charge for access to its website.
Established in 1884 and first printed on pink paper in 1893 to stand out from rivals, the FT has employed some of the leading figures in media and politics, including Robert Thomson, Chief Executive of News Corp NWSA.O, former British finance minister Nigel Lawson and Ed Balls, an adviser to former British prime minister Gordon Brown. 
“I am extremely proud of teaming up with the Financial Times, one of the most prestigious news organizations in the world,” said Tsuneo Kita, chairman and group CEO of Nikkei. “We share the same journalistic values.”
The Nikkei newspaper, which has a circulation surpassing 3 million for its morning edition alone, enjoys a must-read reputation for financial and business news in Japan but has struggled to break out of its home market.
The paper, with its deep ties to corporate Japan, has also faced criticism for running earnings “previews”, which are considered to be leaks, days ahead of corporate results at a time when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has been pushing for greater corporate transparency.
As the news broke of the Nikkei deal, an FT journalist tweeted a photograph showing staff in their newsroom crowded around a television watching the developments.
According to tweets from journalists who were addressed by the paper’s management, FT Editor Lionel Barber told staff the deal “was not and is not a shotgun marriage”, saying there had been hours of conversation.
Reporters at the paper told Reuters there was some apprehension, as they knew very little about their new owner, but there was also relief they had not been bought by Bloomberg - another potential buyer - which could have resulted in duplication of staff roles and more potential job cuts.
Chief Executive John Fallon told reporters he believed that like Pearson, the new owner had a commitment to the “fairness and accuracy of its reporting, and to the integrity and independence of its journalism”.
Reuters was first to report on Thursday that the 171-year-old Pearson had finally decided to sell the business daily as it expanded more into education, sparking speculation as to who was the buyer.
The name of Nikkei came out of the blue. The FT itself reported that Axel Springer, publisher of Germany’s Bild and Die Welt newspapers, was the most likely buyer.
“We were all frantically Googling Axel Springer to find out who they were... and everybody was showing off their great German skills. That obviously changed quite quickly,” said one person familiar with the FT newsroom.
Analysts and bankers had for years been waiting for Pearson to sell the trophy asset, although the names most closely linked with a deal were financial data terminal providers Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters TRI.N, parent of Reuters news agency. 
A person familiar with the situation had told Reuters in recent weeks that Axel Springer was working on a buyout, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the group had held talks about a deal.
The sale of the FT Group is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2015 and does not include its 50 percent stake in The Economist magazine or the London headquarters of the newspaper on the banks of the River Thames.
“It is hard to argue with the price,” said Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at AXA Investment Managers, a shareholder in Pearson.
Barclays said the price represented a multiple of 35 times earnings before interest, tax and appreciation.
Pearson, founded in 1844 as a small building firm in Yorkshire, northern England, was once one of the world’s largest building contractors and has had a long list of varied interests from banking and publishing to owning theme parks and Madame Tussaud’s waxworks.
The sale will leave Pearson as the world leader in education publishing and the owner of a 47 percent stake in the Penguin Random House book publisher.

By Alistair Smout and Liisa Tuhkanen
LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share was steady on Thursday, with caution over events in Greece offset by gains in Dixons Carphone after the electrical goods and mobile phone retailer struck a U.S. deal.
Dixons Carphone rose 3.3 percent after saying it signed with Sprint Corp. to open and manage Sprint-branded stores in the U.S.
Analysts welcomed the deal by the retailer, which was formed last year from the merger of Dixons Retail and Carphone Warehouse.
“It’s quite a smart move. There were a few questions over Carphone Warehouse’s business model. They’ve diversified with the merger with Dixons, but expanding into the States... makes a lot of sense,” Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said.
Britain’s FTSE 100 was flat at 6,609.29 points at 0813 GMT.
Traders said that strong moves in either direction were unlikely ahead of the weekend, when Greece is set to vote in a referendum over its international creditors’ bailout proposals.
The market has been hostage in recent days to fluctuating sentiment over the Greek debt crisis. With creditors saying that they would not restart negotiations before the vote, traders said on Thursday the market did not want to make firm bets on any one outcome.
“The market is arguably waiting for some fresh direction,” said Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct.
“The political grandstanding continues over the Greek debt talks and although the next key indicator here is likely to be the result of Sunday’s referendum, there’s still the prospect of either side throwing in a firework.”
The FTSE 100 closed 1.2 percent up on Wednesday after falling to 5-1/2 month lows earlier in the week. The index is about 7 percent below a record high of 7,122.74 points reached in late April.
Top faller was Intertek, down 3.7 percent after it was downgraded to “underperform” by Jefferies, citing its exposure to oil and gas industries that have been hit by a fall in prices.
“We are concerned that the depth and the duration of the oil and gas downgrades will be a negative surprise, particularly with regards to margins from price pressure,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.
Babcock, British Land, Burberry, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling and Royal Mail traded without entitlement to their latest dividend payout, which trimmed a further 1.7 points off the FTSE 100, by Reuters calculations.

By Matt Scuffham and Sinead Cruise
LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - Barclays Chairman John McFarlane has fired the British bank’s chief executive after he had lost the support of non-executive directors in a clash over style and the pace of the bank’s turnaround.
The move comes just three months after McFarlane joined the bank and three years after Antony Jenkins was promoted to CEO, having been the bank’s retail chief. McFarlane, who had signaled his intention to speed up Barclays’ turnaround efforts when he took the post in April, will assume executive duties until a permanent successor is appointed.
McFarlane said on a conference call on Wednesday he had spoken to Jenkins last week about his position after independent directors of the bank complained to him about the CEO’s leadership style.
Nicknamed “Saint Antony” for his drive to clean up the group’s culture after an interest rate-fixing scandal, Jenkins’ understated approach, in contrast to the brash style of his predecessor Bob Diamond, rubbed board members up the wrong way.
Jenkins’ position was also undermined by a row with the boss of Barclays’ investment bank, Tom King, over the future of the business.
Jenkins wanted to slash the investment bank’s assets more aggressively, according to a person familiar with the matter, but King resisted saying he would retire early from the bank if such a strategy was pursued.
The source said that McFarlane intervened to ensure that King would stay and that the disagreement appeared to have undermined Jenkins’s position.
Reuters could not immediately reach Jenkins for comment. King declined to comment.
Jenkins’ exit, which will be soothed with a payoff of more than 2 million pounds ($3 million), was confirmed at a board meeting late on Tuesday.
Barclays is the fourth major European bank to change CEO this year. Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered also named new leaders amid investor disquiet over low share prices and stubbornly high costs.
Although shares in Barclays have underperformed rivals since Jenkins’ appointment in August 2012, he was expected by many analysts to be given longer to implement a turnaround strategy involving the divestment of non-core assets, improving returns and cutting costs.
“The announcement came as a surprise ... but was not completely unexpected, with returns from the investment banking division still disappointing. The chairman comes with a good reputation and I would back him in his decision,” said David Smith, co-manager of Henderson High Income fund, which has a stake in Barclays.
The investment bank’s performance improved in the first quarter as volatility drove trading, but revenue rose just 2 percent, less than Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs .
Shares in Britain’s third-biggest bank by market value closed up 2 percent at 260 pence, having dropped the previous session to a two-month low.
The move echoes McFarlane’s actions at insurer Aviva, where he took over the full-time running of the insurer in May 2012 having delivered a damning assessment of Chief Executive Andrew Moss’s five years in charge.
Warning signs were evident when McFarlane highlighted the poor performance of Barclays shares in a letter to shareholders after joining the bank in April.
Shares in Barclays are trading at just 0.7 times the value of the bank’s assets. In comparison, British rival Lloyds , which only has a small investment banking business, is trading at 1.3 times.
McFarlane said under Jenkins shareholder value creation had been pushed “too far into the future”. He said the bank was in no rush to appoint a successor and the most important thing was to find the right person, adding it would be good to find someone familiar with investment banking.
The 68-year-old Scot faces a host of challenges as the British bank grapples with regulatory pressures, such as a demand to separate domestic retail banking operations from riskier investment banking operations, while trying to improve its overall performance.
Jenkins’ successor will be tasked with accelerating the run-down of Barclays’ non-core assets. The bank also needs to resolve allegations over alleged past misconduct, while bringing returns back above its cost of capital and deciding how big to keep its investment banking operation.
One senior Barclays executive said the move was seen positively by its investment bankers, noting McFarlane had recently told staff of his commitment to the business. Jenkins had presided over cuts to the investment banking operations involving hundreds of job losses.
“It’s the best possible public message that we could have wished for. He got rid of the guy who was questioning this,” said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.
With his background in retail banking, Jenkins had little affinity with Barclays’ investment bankers and McFarlane indicated his successor will need to have a more established track record in investment banking.
He also emphasized the importance of the investment bank in Barclays’ strategy, seeming to rule out any chance of Barclays exiting it altogether.
“It will be good to have someone that has some familiarity with the investment banking business as it’s such an important part of the business,” McFarlane said.
Candidates to replace Jenkins could include Finance Director Tushar Morzaria, appointed in July 2013 having been chief financial officer of JP Morgan Chase’s corporate and investment banking division.
Morzaria has struck up a strong relationship with McFarlane, according to industry sources.
Another internal candidate could be Jonathan Moulds, the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch executive who was appointed to the newly created role of chief operating officer in January.

This afternoon is effectively people's patience wearing off a little bit.""
Britain’s biggest retailer, Marks & Spencer, was the top loser, down 4.7 percent, due to concerns about the outlook for retailers and how the company will continue to expand.
 Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L shed 1.4 percent, adding to a 5 percent fall in the previous session after U.S. researchers said the company's diabetes drug Avandia increased the risk of heart attack and death from heart problems.
Investors will likely keep an eye for the release of the Bank of England minutes on its May 10 meeting on Wednesday for further clarity on the interest rate picture. The central bank raised borrowing costs by quarter of a percentage point to 5.50 percent at that meeting.

The oil major shut down the 100,000 barrels per day Gathering Center 2 at the field when the spill was discovered.
 BT Group BT.L helped cushion the slide, advancing 3.4 percent to top the FTSE 100 gainers as traders cited renewed bid and leveraged buyout talk despite the company saying last week it had not been approached by private equity and was not in takeover discussions.
 Alliance & Leicester AL.L, Britain's largest building society, rose 3.1 percent after UBS initiated the stock at ""buy"", while Asia-focused Standard Chartered STAN.L tacked on 2.6 percent on continued market talk of a 2,100 pence-per-share bid. StanChart declined to comment.
 But Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L slipped 0.8 percent as traders said talk circulated that its consortium could raise its bid for Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS to 40 euros per share, from its indicated offer of 38.4 euros.
Analysts believed acquisition-hungry European banks may turn their attention to smaller-scale deals in Britain and Germany as the banking sector rapidly consolidates.
 Among other individual movers, telephone directories publisher Yell Group YELL.L advanced 3.3 percent after it posted a rise in annual earnings and said it was confident of achieving further growth this financial year.
 UK pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers MAB.L added 2.3 percent after it said activist shareholder Robert Tchenguiz was the front runner to partner it as it looked to spin off its property assets into a separate company.
 In the mid-caps, Anglo-Dutch software services company LogicaCMG LOG.L slumped 9 percent after issuing a profit warning, blaming a disappointing performance at its UK operations. (Additional reporting by Ana Nicolaci da Costa, Michael Taylor and Rebekah Curtis)

US sanctions put Gazprom-Shell alliance plans in jeopardy,Shell,-0.314,https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-crisis-sanctions-gazprom-idUKL5N10L1U620150810,www.reuters.com,U.S. sanctions put Gazprom-Shell alliance plans in jeopardy,"MOSCOW, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell’s plans to build a strategic alliance with Russia’s Gazprom could be in jeopardy after the United States added one of Gazprom’s biggest gas fields to its list of Russian sanctions on Friday.
Shell and Gazprom signed an agreement in June to develop a strategic alliance in the gas sector, ranging from upstream - exploration and production - to sales, including possible asset swaps.
Development of the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field on the island of Sakhalin in the Pacific, a project known as Sakhalin-3, has been seen as central to that alliance as it would allow the two companies to expand their sole existing LNG venture, Sakhalin-2, located nearby.
State-owned Gazprom was believed to be considering selling a stake in Sakhalin-3 to Shell, which confirmed only last week that it was interested in buying a share, possibly through an asset swap, according to Bloomberg. It may now have to rethink those plans.
On Friday the U.S. government said it was restricting exports, re-exports and transfers of technology and equipment to the Yuzhno-Kirinskoye field.
Shell, with considerable assets in the United States, would face consequences if it went against the sanction, as would other potential foreign investors.
U.S. officials have repeatedly said that sanctions on Russia’s energy sector - part of broader penalties imposed since 2014 over Moscow’s involvement in Ukraine - would target new projects, not existing supplies as that could cause a spike in global energy prices.
“It is clear that this is a signal to Shell - don’t go into new projects, deal with existing ones,” an executive at a Russian energy company who works on projects in Sakhalin said, on condition of anonymity.
Last year, Washington slapped sanctions on an Arctic project that state-owned Russian oil major Rosneft planned to develop with U.S. oil major ExxonMobil, effectively forcing the two companies to suspend drilling despite the discovery of oil.
Sanctions have also affected Russian energy firms’ ability to raise long-term funding and plans to develop shale and deep-water oil resources.
However, this is the first time natural gas production has been targeted and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that new U.S. sanctions would further damage bilateral relations.
Several sources at Gazprom said its lawyers were studying the impact of the U.S. decision. Executives at the company, which announced a 71 percent jump in first-quarter net profit on Monday, told a conference call it was too early to say how the decision could affect the project.
Gazprom wants Sakhalin-3 to provide gas to expand capacity at Sakhalin-2 to as much as 15 million tonnes a year by the next decade from 10 million currently. Shell is the only foreign investor to have expressed interest so far.
Alexander Kornilov, energy analyst at Alfa Bank in Moscow, said Gazprom would have to postpone development of Yuzhno-Kirinskoye and the planned expansion of Sakhalin-2 as both would require Western drilling and liquefaction technologies, which Russia is lacking.
“New sanctions is a surgical strike aimed at slowing down Gazprom’s LNG projects in Asia. It will be impossible for Gazprom to develop Yuzhno-Kirinskoye without partners,” he said citing difficult drilling conditions.
Sakhalin is one of the most important regions in Russia for foreign investment due to its offshore deposits. Yuzhno-Kirinskoye has reserves of 640 billion cubic metres - enough to supply Japan for five years - and 97 million tonnes of gas condensate, a by-product similar to oil.
Shell and Gazprom have invested more than $20 billion in Sakhalin-2, one of the world’s largest liquefaction plants and Japan Mitsui and Mitsubishi Corp are also investors.
Shell said it was engaging with the relevant authorities and taking action to ensure it complies with all applicable sanctions or related measures.
“Shell remains committed to working in Russia and we value working with our Russian partners and colleagues,” a Shell spokeswoman said. (Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Susan Fenton)

Standard Chartered Not Raising Capital Yet As Dividend Cut,Standard Chartered,-0.158,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-standardchartered-capital-idUKKBN0OH1VX20150601,www.reuters.com,"New StanChart boss faces cash call, dividend squeeze ","LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Chartered’s incoming Chief Executive Bill Winters is expected to raise capital and cut the bank’s dividend later this year, potentially forced to act by a tough stress test of its Asian loans, investors and analysts said.
Few believe the ex-JPMorgan rainmaker will miss the chance to bolster the balance sheet during his honeymoon at the Asian-focused lender, especially as Britain’s Prudential Regulation Authority plans a fresh assessment on how shock-proof banks have become since the financial crisis.
The bank has already outlined ambitions to raise a key measure of its capital strength by the end of this year and Winters is expected to sound out investors on further capital raising plans after he takes the reins on June 10.
If he chooses not to raise capital, he could find his strategic choices crimped for at least two years and profits have already shown the strain of trying to “muddle through”, analysts said.
“The approach we think that would protect medium term shareholder value best would be to take decisive action by raising capital up front, followed by balance sheet and business restructuring and a return to growth in the ongoing core bank,” said Jason Napier, banking analyst at Deutsche Bank.
Napier estimated the bank needs to raise $5.25 billion.
“Given the choice, a highly regarded new chief executive would probably always plump for the budget to accelerate balance sheet growth and restructure the business as rapidly as the organization can stand, and write down any existing assets that might be in doubt,” he said.
This year’s PRA “stress test” could hurt Standard Chartered as Asian exposures, a mainstay of its balance sheet, will be tested hard over a 5 year scenario.
The test will include a sharp slowdown in China’s growth, deep recession in Hong Kong, a plunge in commodities prices and currencies and losses from trading book positions.
Several analysts and investors said the bank needed between $5 billion and $10 billion to get its common equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) to the 12-13 percent shareholders expect.
Its ratio was 10.7 percent at the end of last year, and Standard Chartered said it has plans in place to lift this to at least 11 percent by the end of this year.
“$5 billion sounds sensible - the CET1 needs to head to 13 percent over time and with some provision top-ups and restructuring charges, you could easily make a case for $5 billion,” said one shareholder, who asked not to be named.
“The PRA stress tests this year may also add impetus to raise as it will be more rigorous than last time on emerging markets,” he said.
Jefferies analyst Joe Dickerson said the capital position was “a cause for concern” for investors and estimated the bank needs $8.8 billion in capital, while Investec analyst Ian Gordon estimated the capital need at $4.5-$7.5 billion.
Winters could provide a clear indication of strategy alongside half-year results in early August, but he may not set out his full plans until later in the autumn, one banking industry source suggested.
The bank had a $5.2 billion rights issue in 2010, but its capital advantage over most peers has been wiped out since.
Winters could deploy less dramatic options to avoid a lengthy and complex rights issue, including cost cuts and simplifying the bank’s structure by exiting some countries.
The bank is cutting assets by $25-30 billion on a risk-adjusted basis, or one-tenth of its balance sheet.
Winters could supplement that by raising up to $3 billion from a quick-fire share sale to institutional investors, which would follow a $1 billion cash saving after investors opted to take its last dividend in shares. But that meant 69 million new shares were issued - effectively a mini rights issue.
Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, the bank’s second largest shareholder, said he was “ambivalent” about the need for a cash call, and said having lots of capital stashed away would keep the bank balance sheet strong but could drag down its returns.
Analysts are forecasting a dividend cut to 75c from 86c in 2014, but some said it should fall to 65c or less so payouts are less than half of expected earnings.
Winters could also come under pressure to review whether the bank should move its headquarters to Asia from London - although analysts and investors said that should wait until after capital and strategic concerns have been addressed.

* Commodities prices need to improve to ease pressure
* BHP’s S&P rating at ‘A+’, Moody’s at ‘A-1’ (Adds Moody’s comment)
MELBOURNE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton’s investment-grade credit ratings might come under pressure in the current financial year, ratings agencies said on Wednesday, after the top global miner posted its weakest profit in a decade but still hiked dividends.
While BHP has long sought to protect its ‘A+’ rating by Standard and Poor’s and ‘A-1’ rating by Moody’s, it reiterated a pledge on Tuesday to never cut its dividend through the highs and lows of commodity price cycles.
But both ratings firms said that with commodity prices likely to remain weak in the fiscal year to June 2016, the company’s debt to earnings balance may temporarily put it out of the range needed to hold on to its ratings.
S&P said its ‘A+’ rating could withstand a dip in earnings ratios as long as the agency believed those metrics would recover by the following fiscal year.
“Should the weak trading environment persist further, the recovery in credit metrics is unlikely to occur based on BHP Billiton’s earnings alone,” it said.
Both agencies said even with BHP’s sharp cut in capital spending and plans to pare costs beyond the $4.1 billion already slashed in the 2015 financial year, funding the dividend from cash flow would be a challenge if commodity prices worsened.
“This would place further pressure on credit metrics and the rating,” Moody’s said. (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin and Muralikumar Anantharaman)

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - AXA Investment Managers said on Wednesday it had been notified that 34 billion euros ($36.95 billion) in assets it currently manages on behalf of Friends Life would move to Aviva Investors by the end of the year.
The statement followed one from British insurer Aviva in which it said it planned to move some of the funds currently run by AXA in-house, following a review of its operations after buying Friends Life earlier this year.
“From the outset, Aviva made it clear that the acquisition offers the opportunity to increase Aviva Investors’ AUM (assets under management) by recapturing previously outsourced asset management contracts,” AXA said in a statement.
AXA said the withdrawal would likely have a “limited negative impact” on AXA IM’s underlying earnings for 2016, and that it would receive a one-off withdrawal fee, which will be accounted for in its net income.

Shire CEO steps up drive to get Baxalta board talking,Shire,0.124,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baxalta-m-a-shire/shire-steps-up-drive-to-get-baxalta-talking-after-30-billion-bid-idUKKCN0QF21H20150810,www.reuters.com,Shire steps up drive to get Baxalta talking after $30 billion bid,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire SHP.L Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov is stepping up his campaign to get Baxalta BXLT.N to the negotiating table as he pushes the benefits a $30 billion takeover offer to the U.S. biotech company's shareholders.
He has a fight on his hands, with investors in newly listed Baxalta arguing he must pay more, although one person close to the Dublin-based drugmaker said there had been “encouraging feedback” from shareholders on the logic of the tie-up.
Ornskov and Shire’s chairwoman Susan Kilsby, a former mergers and acquisition banker, met Baxalta investors on both sides of the Atlantic at the end of last week and will continue the charm offensive this week.
Baxalta CEO Ludwig Hantson, meanwhile, reiterated his belief that the value of Shire’s offer was “wholly inadequate”.
Shares in Shire and Baxalta both rose on Monday, helped by a bullish note from Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore, who said a takeover did not preclude an eventual acquisition of the enlarged group by a potential suitor like Pfizer PFE.N.
Shire, which took the market by surprise with its move to forge the world’s leading rare diseases company by buying Baxalta, also needs to reassure its own investors.
Joe Walters, senior portfolio manager at Royal London Asset Management, a top 20 investor in Shire, said buying Baxalta was riskier than its previous smaller deals but he was ready to see a bump in the all-share offer, which was worth $45.23 a share at Aug. 3 market prices.
“Around the $50 mark is what it seems management would have to up their offer to, and I think shareholders would be comfortable, or at least mildly comfortable, at that level,” he told Reuters. “But I think they would start to get a little nervous if the offer went much above that price.”
Rudi Van den Eynde, head of thematic global equity at European investment firm Candriam, which has exposure to both companies, was more cautious and described the proposed transaction as “somewhat negative”.
“We would have preferred a deal around a new, promising investigational drug instead of this major deal that comes close to empire building,” he said. “Flemming Ornskov is a hard-driving and well-respected CEO and he could make this deal work, however.”
Shire needs to get Baxalta talking if its proposal is to have a chance, since the U.S. group boasts state-of-the-art defenses, with a “poison pill” that effectively stops unwanted suitors buying more than 10 percent and a hard-to-replace board.
In dismissing the offer, Baxalta argues its shares have not yet achieved a price level that appropriately reflect its prospects, since it was only spun off from Baxter International BAX.N last month. 
“We expect that our stock will move up in price and valuation over the next couple of quarters, just as with nearly every other spin,” CEO Hantson said on a call hosted by Cowen on Monday.
“The implied value of Shire’s proposal is no different from what we think we can achieve on our own in the next six to 12 months, and our investors and analysts agree. In this environment, given our prospects and our outlook, Shire’s offer is not compelling.”
If Shire were to sweeten the offer, however, it might be open to negotiations, said one person familiar with the U.S. company.
Share price fluctuations since Aug. 3 mean Shire’s offer is currently worth around $42.50.

By Alistair Smout
LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Britain’s benchmark share index fell on Tuesday, hit by stock price falls for mining companies and luxury firm Burberry after China devalued the yuan, raising the costs of imports.
China devalued the yuan on Tuesday after a run of poor economic data, guiding the currency to its lowest point in almost three years in a move that economists said was aimed at helping exporters.
Burberry was the top faller in early trading, losing 2.2 percent.
“A weaker yuan makes imports more expensive and with China accounting for some 14 percent of the company’s sales, the implication is clear,” Trustnet Direct analyst Tony Cross said.
Mining groups BHP Billiton, Glencore, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto were down between 1.5 and 2.1 percent. Copper fell 1.5 percent after the move by China, which is the world’s biggest consumer of metals.
The mining sector was down 2.3 percent, moving back towards a six-year low hit in late July.
Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 40.61 points, or 0.6 percent, at 6,695.61 by 0738 GMT. Weakness in commodity stocks has contributed to recent falls in the index, which is now 6 percent off an all-time high hit in April.
Outside blue-chip stocks, Just Retirement rose 1.9 percent, making it a top FTSE 250 riser.
The British retirement specialists plan to merge with Partnership Assurance in an agreed all-share deal worth 669 million pounds, after both companies have been squeezed by recent pension reforms.
Partnership Assurance rose 8.2 percent.
“The merger represents a sensible strategy in our view for Just Retirement and Partnership to continue their growth in the changing retirement income space,” Banco Espirito Santo analysts said in a note.
Outsourcer Serco also rose 1.9 percent, having been as up as much as 6 percent after it posted a better-than-expected fall in revenue in its first half, allowing it to maintain its full-year profit guidance. (Editing by Louise Ireland)

Glencore slumps 25 pct as debt fears grow,Glencore,-0.718,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-europe-stocks-glencore-idUKKCN0RS0UT20150929,www.reuters.com,Glencore slumps 30 percent as debt fears grow,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in mining and trading company Glencore fell almost 30 percent and closed at a record low on Monday over concerns it is not doing enough to cut its debt to withstand a prolonged fall in global metals prices.
About 3.5 billion pounds ($5.33 billion) in market value was wiped off the Swiss-based firm, whose $10 billion share offering in 2011 turned its managers into billionaire shareholders but left it saddled with debt - a growing problem as commodity prices fell.
Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg had to bow to shareholder pressure this month by agreeing to cut debt as worries mounted over the firm’s ability to protect its credit rating.
Glencore has said it will suspend dividends, sell assets and raise cash, among other measures, to cut its $30 billion debt pile and protect its rating after the prices of its main products, copper and coal fell.
The fall followed publication of a note by analysts at investment bank Investec which raised doubts about Glencore’s valuation if spot metal prices do not improve. The note pointed to high debt levels and a need for deeper restructuring.
“If major commodity prices remain at current levels, our analysis implies that, in the absence of substantial restructuring, nearly all the equity value of both Glencore and Anglo American could evaporate,” the analysts wrote.
London-listed Glencore has already raised $2.5 billion through a share placement, part of a wider plan to cut its net debt.
Glencore directors and employees took up 22 percent of the new shares as the company’s executives try to shore up market confidence in the business and retain their stake levels, by percentage.
Glencore's top individual shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, include Glasenberg, with an 8.4 percent stake, and Qatar Holding, with 8.2 percent. Qatar is also a top shareholder of German automaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, another beaten-up blue-chip.
Monday’s fall spread to the broader UK mining sector, which has also felt the pain from an emerging-markets slowdown and a crash in commodities prices. The FTSE 350 mining index sank to its lowest level since Dec. 2008.
Both Glencore and Anglo American declined to comment.
“A FEW LEVERS LEFT”
The sharp slide in Glencore’s share price was triggered by the firm’s move in August to cut its forecast for earnings from trading, a division meant to help cushion the company against tumbling commodities prices.
This was compounded by an increasingly shaky economic outlook for top commodities consumer China and lower copper prices - Glencore’s largest earner.
On Monday shares of Glencore closed down 29.4 percent at 78.09 pence after falling as much as 31 percent to a record low of 66.67 pence. The stock is down around 75 percent year-to-date.
The cost of insuring exposure to the debt of Glencore hit record highs, also on concerns the company could not withstand steep fall in metals prices.
Anglo American shares closed down 10 percent.
Glencore’s plan to cut its net debt by a third by the end of 2016 has failed to boost market confidence in the company.
“Investors are not yet convinced that Glencore has gone far enough to totally allay fears that the industrial assets can service the new lower debt level,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note last week.
“Glencore has a few levers left – further lowering capex, signing streaming deals and releasing more working capital. Recent underperformance suggests that the measures exercised are insufficient and more is needed.”
After Glencore announced its debt-cutting plans, Moody’s credit-rating agency affirmed its Baa2 rating on the company but changed the outlook to negative, from stable, “to reflect the scope for a prolonged difficult market that may cause a slower recovery in Glencore’s financial profile”.
S&P affirmed Glencore’s BBB rating and kept a negative outlook, also citing worries over economic slowdown in China and copper prices.
The outlook for China’s economy was also a drag on markets, with forecasts pointing to a likely shrinking of the country’s giant factory sector for the second month in a row. Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined at the sharpest rate in four years in August, according to official data.
Brewin Dolphin analyst Nik Stanojevic said investors were likely pricing in a fresh drop for metals and commodities prices.
News that Glencore had sold a nickel project in Brazil to Horizonte Minerals for $8 million offered little respite, with Hobart Capital Markets’ Justin Haque saying the price was a fraction of what Glencore had spent.
Traders warned that the stock might fall even further if more assets were put on the block.
“The market is concerned that there is going to be a fire-sale going on at Glencore,” said Beaufort Securities’ sales trader Basil Petrides.
“I don’t think anybody knows where the floor is on the stock at the moment.”

Glencore's top individual shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, include Glasenberg, with an 8.4 percent stake, and Qatar Holding, with 8.2 percent. Qatar is also a top shareholder of German automaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, another beaten-up blue-chip.
Monday’s fall spread to the broader UK mining sector, which has also felt the pain from an emerging-markets slowdown and a crash in commodities prices. The FTSE 350 mining index sank to its lowest level since Dec. 2008.
Both Glencore and Anglo American declined to comment.
“A FEW LEVERS LEFT”
The sharp slide in Glencore’s share price was triggered by the firm’s move in August to cut its forecast for earnings from trading, a division meant to help cushion the company against tumbling commodities prices.
This was compounded by an increasingly shaky economic outlook for top commodities consumer China and lower copper prices - Glencore’s largest earner.
On Monday shares of Glencore closed down 29.4 percent at 78.09 pence after falling as much as 31 percent to a record low of 66.67 pence. The stock is down around 75 percent year-to-date.
The cost of insuring exposure to the debt of Glencore hit record highs, also on concerns the company could not withstand steep fall in metals prices.
Anglo American shares closed down 10 percent.
Glencore’s plan to cut its net debt by a third by the end of 2016 has failed to boost market confidence in the company.
“Investors are not yet convinced that Glencore has gone far enough to totally allay fears that the industrial assets can service the new lower debt level,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note last week.
“Glencore has a few levers left – further lowering capex, signing streaming deals and releasing more working capital. Recent underperformance suggests that the measures exercised are insufficient and more is needed.”
After Glencore announced its debt-cutting plans, Moody’s credit-rating agency affirmed its Baa2 rating on the company but changed the outlook to negative, from stable, “to reflect the scope for a prolonged difficult market that may cause a slower recovery in Glencore’s financial profile”.
S&P affirmed Glencore’s BBB rating and kept a negative outlook, also citing worries over economic slowdown in China and copper prices.
The outlook for China’s economy was also a drag on markets, with forecasts pointing to a likely shrinking of the country’s giant factory sector for the second month in a row. Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined at the sharpest rate in four years in August, according to official data.
Brewin Dolphin analyst Nik Stanojevic said investors were likely pricing in a fresh drop for metals and commodities prices.
News that Glencore had sold a nickel project in Brazil to Horizonte Minerals for $8 million offered little respite, with Hobart Capital Markets’ Justin Haque saying the price was a fraction of what Glencore had spent.
Traders warned that the stock might fall even further if more assets were put on the block.
“The market is concerned that there is going to be a fire-sale going on at Glencore,” said Beaufort Securities’ sales trader Basil Petrides.
“I don’t think anybody knows where the floor is on the stock at the moment.”

LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Britain’s leading share index fell on Monday as fears grew over mining group Glencore’s ability to withstand a metals price slump and as Vodafone’s European tie-up talks with Liberty Global ended.
The FTSE 100 index was down 2.5 percent, at 5,958.86 points at its close, a touch lower than European indexes. The UK market is relatively exposed to mining and commodities stocks, which have fallen sharply as emerging market growth slows.
Glencore slumped 29 percent - its biggest one-day drop - to an all-time low after a Investec raised doubts over the mining and commodities company’s valuation and high debt levels.
“If major commodity prices remain at current levels, our analysis implies that, in the absence of substantial restructuring, nearly all the equity value of both Glencore and Anglo American could evaporate,” Investec analysts wrote.
Anglo American shares fell 10.1 percent.
The FTSE 350 mining index was down 9 percent at its lowest since December 2008. Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Antofagasta all fell more than 4.5 percent.
“One cannot deny the fact that investors are - if the (Glencore) share price is telling you anything - extremely concerned about the near-term outlook,” Charles Stanley market analyst, Jeremy Batstone-Carr, said.
The outlook for China’s economy was also a drag, with forecasts pointing to a likely shrinking of its factory sector for the second month in a row. Profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined at the sharpest rate in four years in August, according to official data.
“It may be too soon to believe a bottom is in (for commodity prices),” London Capital Group analyst, Brenda Kelly, said.
On the deal-making front, Vodafone was hit by news that tie-up talks between the network operator and Liberty Global had collapsed. Vodafone shares were down 4.8 percent, their lowest level in 10 months.
Among standout gainers, brewer SABMiller touched six-month highs, rising 1.3 percent after a report in the Sunday Times that Anheuser-Busch might bid about $106 billion for the company.
“News of the proposed takeover of SABMiller ... has put M&A firmly in the spotlight,” HSBC strategists wrote in a note to clients. “We believe (companies) will increasingly choose to buy (rivals) because the macro is so uncertain.” (Editing by Louise Ireland)

Sept 24 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc said the European health regulator had recommended an approval for its injectable drug to treat asthma patients who don’t respond well to traditional inhalers.
The European Commission is expected to decide on a final approval for the drug, Nucala, before the end of 2015.
Nucala, a monthly injection, is also being tested for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a respiratory disorder often associated with smoking.
The treatment could help boost GSK’s respiratory drugs business as demand weakens for its asthma drug, Advair.
A significant minority of asthma patients do not respond to regular inhalers such as Advair, Dulera and Flovent, creating what analysts estimate to be a potential multi-billion dollar market.
GSK and other drugmakers including AstraZeneca Plc, Roche Holding AG, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Sanofi SA are developing drugs that take a more personalized approach to asthma care.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to give its decision on Nucala by Nov. 4.

Glencore fight back over debt fears lifts shares,Glencore,0.278,https://www.reuters.com/article/glencore-credit/update-3-glencore-fightback-over-debt-fears-lifts-shares-idUKL5N11Z2Y020150929,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 3-Glencore fightback over debt fears lifts shares,"* Glencore says has positive cash flow
* Glencore says has secure funding access
* Management buyout would be one option - Citi (Adds details, updates share price)
JOHANNESBURG/LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Glencore said on Tuesday it was strong enough to ride out current volatility in commodity markets, helping to lift the mining group’s shares by a fifth.
Glencore’s stock rebounded after a fall of 30 percent to a record low on Monday in response to uncertainty over its ability to cope with a prolonged fall in global metal prices.
Its shares closed up 16.9 percent at 84.91 pence in London.
The Swiss-based company said its business remained operationally and financially robust and it was confident in the medium and long-term fundamentals of its commodities, which include copper and coal.
“We have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues,” a company spokesman said in a statement.
“Glencore has no debt covenants and continues to retain strong lines of credit and secure access to funding.”
Lenders said on Tuesday they remain supportive of the embattled commodities trader and mining company, which has around $13 billion of liquidity available and can finance its debt maturities for two years.
“We are watching quite carefully, but without the concern or type of hysteria you are seeing in equities,” a head of loan syndicate at a bank said. “If the company is left to resolve its own issues, we are quite confident that they will do so.”
The shares had plunged on Monday wiping about 3.5 billion pounds from Glencore’s market value on fears the group was not doing enough to cut its $30 billion debt pile as commodity prices tumbled.
Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg had to bow to shareholder pressure this month by agreeing to cut Glencore’s debts and protect its credit rating after the prices of its main products fell.
Glencore plans to suspend dividends, sell assets, cut copper production and raise cash, among other measures, to cut its net debt by a third by the end of 2016. The group has already raised $2.5 billion through a share placement.
On Tuesday, Chile’s second-biggest copper mine Collahuasi, which is owned by Glencore and Anglo American, announced plans to cut output by 300,000 tonnes per year to protect against sinking copper prices.
Glencore’s $10 billion share listing in London in 2011 turned its managers into billionaires. Now there is speculation it might make sense for Glencore management to take the company private.
Analysts at Citi have said Glencore should consider going private via a management buyout. Such a move would make it easier to restructure while metals prices are slumping and could allow various assets to be spun off.
“In the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly,” Citi analysts wrote in a note to clients.
But mining industry bankers said it would be virtually impossible for management to put together the required financing for any buyout.
“How, in a market where everyone thinks it has too much leverage, would you put leverage on it?” one senior banker said.
Instead, the company is expected to step up its divestment plans beyond those already announced earlier this month, one banking source said, adding that while other options like a company split or a buyout of the trading business were possible, they were unlikely.
Three Glencore executives are among the firm’s top ten shareholders, including Glasenberg with an 8.42 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. Just two weeks ago, management took up 22 percent of the new shares being issued at 125 pence each. The stock has fallen more than a third since then.
Glencore has been holding talks with talks with investor trade body Investment Association related to its $2.5 billion equity placing, Sky News reported.
Some investors, including the Investment Association, have criticised the way in which Glencore raised the money, saying that the mining company had breached shareholder protection principles.
A spokesman for Investment Association confirmed to Reuters that the trade body was in talks with Glencore, but did not divulge any further details. Glencore declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Freya Berry in London.; Writing by Jane Merriman. Editing by Susan Thomas and Christian Plumb)

By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller
BRUSSELS/LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev , the world’s largest brewer, has approached rival SABMiller about a takeover that would form a colossus producing a third of the world’s beer.
A merged group would have a market value of around $275 billion at current prices, and would combine AB InBev’s dominance of Latin America with SABMiller’s of Africa, both fast-growing markets, as well as their breweries in Asia.
“The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev has no presence, as well as some add-ons in Asia and Latin America,” said Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland.
AB InBev and other top brewers are trying to move into new markets as they look to shrug off weakness in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly choose craft beers made by independent players or wine or spirits.
SABMiller, the world No. 2 and maker of more than 200 beers including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oct. 14 under British rules.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed its approach. 3G, known for its focus on cost cuts at the expense of marketing, has previously orchestrated takeovers of Burger King, ketchup maker Heinz and Kraft Foods.
A source close to SAB said it was too early to say what it would do since no offer has been made.
“At this stage, we’re in wait and see mode,” said the source.
Speculation about a merger, likely to raise antitrust concerns in markets such as the United States and China, has swirled for years. The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a roughly 15 percent drop in SABMiller’s share price since August.
“It’s exactly the moment they’ve been waiting for,” said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham. “It makes sense financially for the first time in years.”
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SAB Miller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, according to analysts - implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller’s debt.
That would make it the biggest M&A deal of 2015, already shaping up to be a record year since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of deal volume, and one the five largest takeovers since 1980.
Shares in SAB closed up 19.9 percent at 36.14 pounds, giving it a market capitalization of $90 billion. AB InBev’s were up 6.4 percent. Rivals Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo also rose on speculation SAB might seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it did last year when it offered to buy Heineken, but was rebuffed.
Since then it has combined its African soft drink bottler with that of Coca-Cola, and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combining with Diageo or Australian drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil.
The global beer market share of AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1 percent in 2014, while SABMiller’s was 15 percent, according to industry experts Plato Logic. Heineken is the No. 3.
AB InBev’s target for its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio is 2 times, from around 2.5 currently. It is likely to reach that by 2016, the earliest any deal could realistically be completed, and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover.
When it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash takeover in history at the time, it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times. Going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $100 billion in debt.
AB InBev’s controlling families own just over half of the company, while SABMiller’s two top shareholders are cigarette maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.
Altria on Wednesday declined to comment on the AB InBev approach, but on Sept. 9, its CFO Billy Gifford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evaluates its SABMiller investment “and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders’ best interests.”
The Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached for comment.
Neil Dwane, European chief investment officer, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, said AB InBev had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
“ABI is paying a high price but accretion to earnings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 percent. However, we think the return on this deal could be a relatively disappointing 8 percent after 10 years,” Dwane said.
There are significant antitrust hurdles to any combination, particularly in the United States, where the companies would have about 70 percent of the beer market.
“The costs that could be saved in the distribution operations are high - and the antitrust hurdles are higher,” said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.
A deal would allow Molson Coors to acquire the 58 percent of the joint venture owned by SABMiller according to the operating agreement that governs it. A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to acquire an additional 8 percent and name a new CEO at the venture. Denver-based Molson would also have the right of first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent stake.
A Molson spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in a bid, but Molson shares surged more than 12 percent to an all-time high.
Any merged group may also have to sell interests in China, where SABMiller’s CR Snow joint venture with China Resources is the market leader. Heineken, Carlsberg or China’s Tsingtao could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that after disposals, the combined group could end up with a 28 percent global market share.
AB InBev is being advised by Lazard, while SABMiller is being advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

Copper market may get a 2003-style supply shock from Glencore closures,Glencore,-0.571,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-copper-glencore-idUKKCN0RM0PJ20150922,www.reuters.com,Copper market may get a 2003-style supply shock from Glencore closures,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As copper miners start to slash spending and shutter mines because of the plunge in the price of the metal, experts who analyze the market in the base metal are suddenly getting a little more cheery.
They are seeing the potential for a re-run of 2003 when Chile’s Codelco, the world’s top copper producer stockpiled 200,000 tonnes of the metal that is used in everything from pipes to autos, providing the market with a supply shock that soon drove copper prices back up.
This time around hopes are pinned on the announcement earlier this month from Glencore of a sweeping strategy to shore up cash and cut spending, including plans to shutter two major, high-cost copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo over the next 18 months. That will cut company output by 400,000 tonnes and remove some 2 percent of global supply from the market.
For Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg, the plan helped placate shareholders worried about $30 billion of debt as prices of its main products from copper to coal sank to six-year lows amid worries about China’s waning appetite for such commodities. The company’s shares jumped 7 percent on the news, although they have since come under renewed pressure, hitting fresh all-time lows last week. They are down 60 percent so far this year.
For the beleaguered copper market, it was the first meaningful supply-side shock since the start of the current year-long copper rout. It has the potential to help trigger a long, slow revival in prices, analysts and other experts said.
There is a big similarity with the market in 2002-2003, much more than the financial crisis-driven plunge in 2008, said Leon Westgate, analyst at ICBC Standard Bank.
Twelve years ago, prices were languishing near 14-year lows and global inventory was skyrocketing. In response, the state-run Codelco built the stockpile of 200,000 tonnes of copper cathodes near the northern Chilean port of Antofagasta. It kept that material off the market until conditions had improved.
The comparisons with 2003 only go so far.
China devoured a record 9.4 million tonnes of copper last year, almost half of the global total, against just 3 million tonnes in 2003. The country’s average annual growth rate in demand of more than 10 percent over the past decade has plunged to around 3-4 percent this year, and that has been a big reason for the recent price slump.
Arguably the copper market was in a weaker state in 2003 than it is now. Global inventories of 1.5 million tonnes were three times higher than current levels, and at around $1,300 per tonne prices were about a quarter of current levels.
Glencore may find it tougher to implement its plan, which threatens jobs in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, than government-owned Codelco. But the events of 12 years ago could show how a major supply shock may be just what is needed to stem losses, eventually helping prices to recover.
Citi analyst David Wilson cautions against taking cues from macro events when producers like Glencore are showing they can respond aggressively to weak prices. “There has been a clear dislocation in the recognition of reduced output growth versus copper prices, but for how long can this continue?,” he asked.
Combined with mine outages and China’s emergence as a major buyer as its economy took off, Codelco’s move in 2003 rescued the copper market from a prolonged downturn.
By 2005, prices had more than doubled to over $3,000 per tonne, global inventories had plunged to just 100,000 tonnes and the market was in the early throes of a boom that saw prices near $10,000 per tonne in 2010.
This time, few analysts expect prices to recover by that magnitude, and there are few signs of a significant rebound in Chinese demand, but Glencore’s shutdown is expected to tip the market into a small supply deficit next year, Westgate at ICBC Standard Bank said.
ICBC and Citibank reckon an annualized 1.5 million tonnes has already been lost this year due to power outages, strikes, floods and drought, as well as lower grade source material from producers in various places, from Zambia to Chile.
Fresh cuts and stabilizing demand could propel prices towards $5,700 per tonne in the fourth quarter, Citi’s Wilson said. That’d be a rise of 8 percent from current levels of $5,270 per tonne, which are down from around $7,000 per tonne a year ago.
Any other unexpected supply shocks or signs that Beijing is preparing to boost spending further on industries that use copper intensively could trigger a more significant rally into next year.
“The market’s tighter compared with back then. You don’t need extreme demand to kick in because the market’s already tight,” said Westgate.
Last Thursday, prices rallied to two-month highs after a powerful earthquake struck off Chile’s coast, forcing Codelco and Chilean rival Antofagasta to temporarily close two big mines, raising concerns about supply disruptions. The gains evaporated as the mines reopened and lingering worries about Chinese demand returned.
There are few recent examples of wholesale mine and smelter closures because producers prefer to slash costs by shelving expansion plans or mining higher grades. Late last month, Freeport McMoran Inc was the biggest operator to bite the bullet, with plans to close a small U.S. mine and on Monday, Europe’s No. 2 copper producer, Poland’s KGHM, said it would suspend its McCreedy West copper mine. Combined, they account for less than 50,000 tonnes per year of copper.
The last time prices were this low, in 2008, the rout was quick and deep - prices more than halved to under $3,000 per tonne within months of Lehman Brothers going bust in the financial crisis. But it was relatively shortlived after China swooped in to buy copper in large quantities in early 2009, setting a floor under prices and restoring market confidence.
“In 2008, the sentiment was less negative than now because China announced a number of economic measures that inspired confidence in the market,” said Juan Carlos Guajardo, executive director of Santiago-based mining consulting firm Plusmining.

TalkTalk hires BAE Systems to investigate cyber attack,TalkTalk,-0.113,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-talktalk-cyberattack-idUKKCN0SJ0P020151025,www.reuters.com,TalkTalk hires BAE Systems to investigate cyber attack,"LONDON (Reuters) - British broadband provider TalkTalk said on Sunday it had hired defence company BAE Systems to investigate a cyber attack that may have led to the theft of personal data from its more than 4 million customers.
TalkTalk said on Friday it had received a ransom demand from an unidentified party for the attack, which has led to calls for greater regulation of how companies and public bodies manage personal data.
“BAE Systems are supporting us as we investigate this week’s cyber attack,” a spokeswoman for TalkTalk said, declining to give further details due to the ongoing investigation.
A spokeswoman for BAE’s Applied Intelligence division said the company’s cyber-specialists were analysing “vast quantities” of data to help establish how the breach happened and what information was stolen.
The Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit is also conducting a criminal investigation into the attack.
While TalkTalk said on Saturday it did not believe the information accessed would enable hackers to steal money from its customers, British newspapers on Sunday carried stories of individuals who said callers posing as TalkTalk employees had taken money from their bank accounts.
Many customers took to social media to complain about their treatment following the attack, TalkTalk’s third data breach this year, with media also reporting some had been told they faced hundreds of pounds in fees to leave the provider.
Britain’s Information Commissioner watchdog, which can impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds, has said it is looking into the incident but security experts said the prevalence of cyber crime showed more needed to be done.
Data released by the Office for National Statistics this month showed there were nearly 2.5 million incidents of cyber crime in the year to June 2015.
Simon Moores, chair of the International eCrime Congress and a former government technology ambassador, said so far the commissioner had proved “somewhat toothless”.
“The Information Commissioner needs to have more powers to reflect the direction of travel ... at a time of rampant identity theft and exploitation of financial details,” Moores told Reuters.
He said Britain should give responsibility for information security to a single minister rather than have it spread across several government departments.
“You need to encourage a culture and a level of responsibility where all large organisations ... take serious ownership and responsibility for the privacy of people’s financial and personal data rather than having a cavalier attitude, which we have seen in so many cases,” he said.

* Setback may mean delay of 1-2 years, analysts believe
* AstraZeneca predicted $3 bln sales for combination (Adds analyst comments on likely length of delay)
LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators declined to approve a fixed-dose diabetes drug combination from AstraZeneca, delaying its launch and dealing a blow to an important plank of the drugmaker’s business.
AstraZeneca said on Friday it had received a so-called complete response letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stating that more clinical data were required before it could approve the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin.
Such letters typically outline concerns and conditions that must be addressed to gain U.S. approval and the move means AstraZeneca faces an unspecified wait in getting its potential blockbuster drug cocktail to market.
Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said the FDA move probably reflected lack of data on the new formulation rather than safety or efficacy concerns and it seemed likely a launch would simply be delayed by between 12 and 24 months.
Morgan Stanley analysts said a best-case scenario was an 8-10 months’ delay but this could extend to a few years if new clinical trials were needed.
Last year, during its defence against a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer, AstraZeneca predicted the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin fixed-dose combination could generate peak annual sales of $3 billion, out of total diabetes revenue of $8 billion expected by 2023.
Shares in the company were flat by late morning, underperforming a 1.5 percent rise in the European drugs sector .
AstraZeneca said the FDA wanted to see more clinical trial data from ongoing or completed studies and it might also require information from new studies.
The individual component drugs in the new mix are already approved and marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, under the brand names Onglyza and Farxiga, and the FDA move is not expected to affect their status, the company added.
Sales of Onglyza reached $391 million in the first half of 2015, with recently launched Farxiga selling $205 million.
Onglyza is a type of diabetes medicine known as a DPP-IV inhibitor, similar to Merck’s highly successful Januvia.
Farxiga belongs to a newer drug class called SGLT2 inhibitors, which have created great excitement since a clinical trial last month showed that Eli Lilly’s Jardiance slashed deaths in patients at risk of heart attack and stroke. (Editing by William Hardy, Jane Merriman, Adrian Croft)

* Top shareholder Altria supports offer, No. 2 does not (Adds comments by AB InBev CEO)
By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller
BRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - SABMiller, the world’s second largest brewer, has promptly rejected an improved takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev, saying its 68 billion-pound ($104 billion) valuation was “very substantially” under par.
Refusal of the offer, made public on Wednesday after earlier proposals were refused privately, opens the door to a week of intense wrangling before an Oct. 14 deadline for a formal bid set by the UK takeover panel.
The deal would be one of the biggest in corporate history, uniting the maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois beers with that of Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell. The combined entity would make nearly a third of the world’s beer.
AB InBev realistically needs access to SAB’s private financial data if it is to make an informed formal bid, but said that so far the board had not engaged meaningfully.
A deadline extension can be granted if SABMiller asks for it, and AB InBev wants shareholders to lobby the company.
“The deadline is approaching and we thought we should make it public,” AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said on a conference call. “Now it’s up to the shareholders to have a look at it. If they think this is a good offer, they should act and encourage the board to engage.”
Brito said he was committed to a friendly deal, but did not rule out going hostile.
“I don’t want to go there now. I think there’s too much to be gained in the next few days,” he said.
Belgium-based AB InBev went public with its offer of 42.15 pounds in cash per SABMiller share, after the board rejected two prior approaches, at 38 and 40 pounds. The offer includes a discounted cash-and-share alternative designed only for SAB’s two largest shareholders, Altria Group and BevCo.
The discount aims to satisfy their desire to avoid huge taxes on cash gains and ensure all other shareholders accept cash, which would be financed with the help of a $70 billion debt package being lined up.
Altria, the tobacco group which has 26.6 percent of SABMiller, said it supported the bid and would be prepared to opt for the share alternative.
AB InBev said it lacked the support of BevCo, controlled by the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Representatives for BevCo, which owns about 13 percent of SABMiller, could not be reached by Reuters. BevCo has two seats on the SABMiller board.
SABMiller said its board, excluding the three members nominated by Altria, unanimously rejected the proposal.
“It still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its standalone prospects,” the UK-based company said in a statement.
SABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis called his company “the crown jewel of the global brewing industry” and said AB InBev’s proposals were designed to be unattractive to many shareholders.
Lawyers not involved in the deal interpreted SAB’s language as implying that it could want as much as 10 percent more than the proposed price, which amounts to a 44 percent premium to SAB’s share price before news of AB InBev’s approach was made public on Sept. 16.
AB InBev’s CEO called the price “full” and said SAB’s board was “over-optimistic” about its standalone prospects, saying the company would need an almost 50 percent jump in operating earnings in U.S. dollars to make up the value he is offering and that that would likely not happen for at least three or four years.
The cash-and-share alternative, which is technically open to all shareholders, would give them 2.37 pounds per share plus 0.48 special unlisted AB InBev shares that are convertible into ordinary stock after a five-year lock-up period.
Given that AB InBev intends to use this instrument to acquire the stakes of Altria and BevCo, which together own about 41 percent of the company, SABMiller said the implied price tag was only 40.21 pounds per share, or 65 billion pounds ($99.53 billion).
RBC Capital Markets analysts said the proposal appeared some way below a “knock-out” bid, and Bernstein Securities said a higher bid, and acceptance, was the most likely outcome.
SABMiller shares closed up 0.3 percent at 37.24 pounds, while AB InBev closed up 0.6 percent in Brussels at 98.65 euros.
Analysts have long seen this deal as the likely end-game for decades of industry consolidation, as the big four - AB InBev, SABMiller, Heineken and Carlsberg already brew over half the world’s beer.
It would add Africa and certain Latin American and Asian breweries to AB InBev’s presence across the Americas.
“We believe Africa in particular will be a key driver for the joint company in the future,” Brito said.
AB InBev also said it planned to establish a secondary share listing and regional headquarters in Johannesburg, where SABMiller has a secondary listing, which local investors have said they want retained.
Public Investment Corp, a South African state-owned firm with a 3.4 percent stake in SABMiller, said the listing addressed one of its concerns and that it would wait for guidance from SABMiller’s board.
AB InBev, partly controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors, has a strong track record for takeovers, followed by keen cost-cutting, but Brito declined to say what potential synergies a SABMiller deal might realise. ($1 = 0.6530 pounds)

"METALS-Zinc surges 12 pct after Glencore cuts output, fuelling metals rally",Glencore,0.162,https://www.reuters.com/article/markets-metals-idCNL8N1291CI20151009,www.reuters.com,"METALS-Zinc surges 12 pct after Glencore cuts output, fuelling metals rally","* Glencore to cut 500,000 tonnes of annual zinc production
* Global zinc market to swing into deficit -analyst
* Markets relieved that Fed seen holding off raising rates (Updates with closing prices)
LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Zinc surged 12 percent to a two-month peak on Friday and other base metals also rose strongly after commodities group Glencore said it would cut its zinc output by a third, sparking a short-covering rally across the board.
Zinc’s jump, its biggest one-day gain in at least a decade, followed Glencore’s announcement that it will cut 500,000 tonnes of annual zinc production, equivalent to around 4 percent of global supply, in its latest response to weak commodities prices.
The miner has already pledged copper and coal production cuts in response to prices at multi-year lows.
The rally is a shot in the arm for the beleaguered metals industry, many of whose members are heading to London for the annual LME Week celebrations which start on Monday.
“This (Glencore move) is big, it’s much bigger than the move in copper, it shifts the needle substantially. The rally is not going to all peter out, though having said that the jump today is in large part because of short covering,” BNP Paribas strategist Stephen Briggs said.
Zinc mine supply had already been set to shrink given the closure of MMG’s huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland this year.
“The cut is certainly significant and swings the zinc market into a deficit for 2016, which we estimate will now be around 300,000 tonnes, a reversal of the 180,000 tonne surplus we were forecasting earlier,” analyst Edward Meir at INTL FCSTone said in a note.
London Metal Exchange three-month zinc shot up to an intraday peak of $1,875 a tonne, a gain of 12.5 percent. That was its highest price since Aug. 11 and its biggest single-day gain in Reuters data, which goes back to mid-2005. It closed up 10.1 percent at $1,835.
Zinc prices sank to their lowest in over five years at$1,601.50 late last month, partly on an overhang of inventories.
Also supporting metals was a weaker dollar index, which fell on the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates, making commodities cheaper for buyers outside of the United States.
Lead, which is often mined alongside zinc, surged nearly 9 percent at one point to $1,821.50 a tonne, its highest since late July, before paring gains to close at $1,780, up 6.4 percent.
Copper climbed 3 percent to finish at $5,290 a tonne while aluminium gained 3.3 percent to end at $1,613.
Nickel raced 6 percent higher to a two-month peak of $10,785 a tonne before retreating. It failed to trade in closing open outcry activity and was bid at $10,500, up 3.2 percent. Tin added 1.6 percent to close at $16,150.
For metals, concerns persist about the growth slowdown in China, which consumes about half the world’s copper.
Senior metals executives in China expect most base metals will face tepid demand there next year.

By Sudip Kar-Gupta
LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index rose on Friday, lifted by drugmaker Shire, whose shares climbed on speculation it could be lining up a bid for a U.S. rival.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended up 0.6 percent at 6,378.04 points.
Shire rose 3.2 percent, which traders attributed to speculation it was preparing a bid for U.S. peer Radius Health, seen as a potentially good deal for the British group. Shire declined to comment on the situation.
Traders added that expectations of new stimulus measures from China, the world’s second-biggest economy, were giving equity markets a further lift.
Signs of a slowdown in China knocked back world stock markets in the third quarter, with the FTSE still down 4 percent since the start of 2015, and down around 10 percent from an April record high of 7,122.74 points.
“With half an eye on the possibility of more central bank stimulus, stocks have edged out a positive finish to the week,” said CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler.
Burberry was among the worst performing stocks on the FTSE, falling 1.9 percent to extend the previous session’s slide, as a profit warning late on Thursday from Hugo Boss hit luxury goods companies.
Hugo Boss cut its 2015 sales and profit outlook, while price target cuts from brokers on Burberry’s shares on Friday added further pressure to the British company, whose shares had already slumped 8.3 percent on Thursday on weak sales growth.
GKN and other engineering stocks also fell after brokerage Liberum cut estimates on the sector.

"EXCLUSIVE-BP, China's CNPC to unveil oil alliance - sources",CNPC,0.318,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-china-idUSKCN0SA1II20151016,www.reuters.com,"Exclusive: BP, China's CNPC to unveil oil alliance - sources","LONDON (Reuters) - BP Plc and China’s CNPC [CNPET.UL] will next week unveil a strategic alliance to develop oil resources in Iraq and other regions, industry sources said on Friday, as Britain and China seek to tighten economic ties.
The pact, one of several high-profile deals to be signed during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Britain, will aim to bolster cooperation between the two companies in Iraq, where they are developing the giant Rumaila oilfield.
Rumaila, in southern Iraq, is the world’s second-largest oilfield and produced 1.34 million barrels per day in 2014, according to BP’s website.
The two companies will also seek to expand into new joint ventures in other parts of the world, according to the sources. No clear production or investment targets are expected to be included in the deal, they said.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corp is Asia’s largest oil producer and parent of PetroChina Co Ltd.
BP will also seek to use the alliance to expand its operations in China, which have been limited mainly to a fuel retail joint venture. Its peers Royal Dutch Shell and Total have natural gas operations with CNPC.
For CNPC, the alliance could offer opportunities also to deepen operations in the North Sea and West Africa, where BP has extensive operations.
A BP spokesman declined to comment. CNPC was not immediately available to comment.
The British government wants to use Xi’s Oct. 19-23 visit to tighten cooperation between the two countries with a number of economic and cultural agreements.
Britain hopes to sign an agreement with Chinese utility companies CGN and CNNC to finance the construction of two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. It was unclear, however, whether the long-mooted deal would be inked during the trip, China’s ambassador Liu Xiaoming told reporters.
Xi’s state visit, during which he will dine at Buckingham Palace, marks a significant improvement in ties between the two countries after Prime Minister David Cameron angered Beijing in 2012 by meeting the Dalai Lama.

Supreme Court Upholds $236 Million Jury Award Against ExxonMobil,ExxonMobil,-0.459,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-new-hampshire-mtbe-idUSKCN0RW2B620151002,www.reuters.com,New Hampshire court upholds $236 million water pollution judgment against Exxon,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - New Hampshire’s top court on Friday upheld a $236 million judgment against Exxon Mobil Corp over groundwater contamination linked to gasoline additive MTBE.
The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling affirms a 2013 jury decision that rejected Exxon’s claims that contamination linked to the fuel additive was the fault of the local gas stations and storage facilities that spilled it.
In the 1990s, in response to U.S. clean air regulations, MTBE was commonly added to gasoline to reduce smog. Subsequent studies found that the chemical easily penetrated and contaminated groundwater, and its use was gradually phased out.
New Hampshire’s lawsuit against Exxon, which is headquartered in Irving, Texas, dates back to 2003. State officials say the $236.3 million judgment is the largest MTBE verdict since states and other agencies began making the claims for remediation and other damages.
“This is the most significant environmental victory in the history of the state,” New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster said in a statement on Friday. “This historic decision sends a clear message that New Hampshire will not permit polluters to endanger the health of its citizens and destroy its natural resources.”
A spokesman for Exxon said on Friday that the company is considering appealing the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,” spokesman Todd Spitler said in an email.
“The state should have sued the parties responsible for spilling gasoline, not the refiners who were compelled by law to add oxygenates to gasoline,” he said.
In 2014, Exxon appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court a $105 million jury verdict in favor of New York City over MTBE contamination, but the court declined to hear the case, letting the decision stand.
According to New Hampshire officials, more than 600 wells in the southern part of the state are contaminated with MTBE.
New Hampshire has received $90 million in legal settlements with other gasoline suppliers over MTBE contamination. The state has yet to receive any compensation from Exxon.

UPDATE 1-Lloyds to cut 945 jobs as part of 3-year restructuring plan,Lloyds,-0.266,https://www.reuters.com/article/lloyds-employment-idINL8N13L2QA20151126,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Lloyds to cut 945 jobs as part of 3-year restructuring plan,"(Adds Unite statement)
LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Taxpayer-backed Lloyds Banking Group said on Thursday it was cutting around 945 jobs in a restructuring plan first outlined a year ago with the aim of reducing the bank’s workforce by 9,000.
The staff affected are currently employed within the bank’s retail, commercial banking and consumer finance teams, and in several back office divisions, the bank said.
Europe’s second-biggest bank by market value said it planned to cut around 9,000 roles - roughly 10 percent of its workforce - in October 2014, in response to the increasing popularity of online banking and the automation of some back office functions.
“The group’s policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group,” the bank said in a statement.
“Where it is necessary for employees to leave the company, it will look to achieve this by offering voluntary redundancy. Compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort.”
It said recognised unions Accord and Unite were consulted prior to the announcement and will continue to be consulted.
Rob MacGregor, Unite’s National Officer for Finance, said the bank had committed to providing alternative jobs, voluntary redundancy and voluntary job swapping to those employees affected where possible.
“We will make sure the bank keep to these commitments, while continuing to consult and support our members,” he said in a statement.
Lloyds was rescued with a 20.5 billion pound taxpayer-funded bailout during the 2007-09 financial crisis, leaving the state holding 43 percent. The government has since reduced its holding to less than 10 percent, raising around 16 billion pounds for the public purse.
The bank reported weaker than expected third-quarter results last month, and set aside another 500 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, bringing its total compensation bill to nearly 14 billion pounds, more than double that of any other bank.
The government is planning to sell at least 2 billion pounds worth of shares in Lloyds next spring and return the bank to full private ownership. (Reporting By Sinead Cruise, editing by Steve Slater)

Glencore sees Tripoli-based NOC as sole legal seller of Libyan oil,Glencore,0.037,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-libya-oil-glencore-idUKKBN0TF14O20151126,www.reuters.com,Glencore sees Tripoli-based NOC as sole legal seller of Libyan oil,"LONDON (Reuters) - Commodities trader Glencore GLEN.L said on Thursday it recognises Libya's Tripoli-based National Oil Corp. (NOC) as the sole legal marketer of the country's oil, after securing an export deal earlier this year with the state-run company.
The Tripoli-based NOC has said it operates independently of either the rival government that controls the capital city or the internationally recognised government based in the east of the country, which earlier this year set up a separate NOC.
“International oil companies and the international community fully support NOC’s position,” said Alex Beard, head of oil at Glencore.
“They have made it very clear there is no alternative to the NOC at its legal address in Tripoli as the only recognised marketer of Libyan oil,” he said in a statement.
Bloomberg reported last week the government in the east would prevent any tanker operated by Glencore from loading oil at Libyan ports if it did business with the Tripoli-based NOC.
Under the arrangement with the existing NOC, which began in September, Glencore loads and finds buyers for all the Sarir and Messla crude oil exported from the Marsa el-Hariga port near the country’s eastern border with Egypt.
While Libyan oil exports peaked at 1.6 million barrels per day, battles between rival factions seeking to control the country, as well as strikes and blockades by local tribes, have kept production under 0.5 million bpd for most of the past year.
Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of the Tripoli-based NOC, on Thursday reiterated comments told to Reuters in an interview earlier this month, that Libya’s oil partners and the international community fully backed the company, despite attempts by the recognised government in the east to set up a parallel oil payments system.
“The NOC, at its legal address in Tripoli, remains the only legally empowered oil contracting authority of the Libyan state,” Sanalla said.
“It remains the seat of contracts for all the production, transportation and sale of Libyan oil. The board of NOC is committed to protecting the integrity and viability of the NOC.”

The move is part of an “externalisation” drive by the British drugmaker, which is selling non-core products to help it fill a short-term revenue gap caused by older products going off product, while investing in a pipeline of new medicines.
Entocort had U.S. sales of $89 million in the first nine months of 2015.
The deal, which is expected to complete by the end of 2015, follows AstraZeneca’s sale of rights to Entocort outside the United States in July to Tillotts Pharma, part of the Zeria Group.

AstraZeneca, which on Thursday lifted its full-year earnings forecast despite the eroding sales of some of its top-selling medicines, said it would pay $90 a share to secure ZS Pharma’s proprietary technology to develop novel treatments for hyperkalaemia, or high potassium levels.
Actelion revealed in September it had initiated talks with ZS Pharma that could have led to a bid.
“This acquisition complements our strategic focus on Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease by adding a potential best-in-class treatment to our portfolio of innovative medicines,” AstraZeneca’s Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said.
Facing the loss of patent protection for some older products, Astra has engineered several bolt-on acquisitions to help build up its pipeline of new drugs. This year it has also divested certain non-core products to boost its profit line.
Hyperkalaemia is typically associated with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure, AstraZeneca said, adding that peak sales of the company’s ZS-9 potassium-binding compound, which is under review by the FDA, were forecast to exceed $1 billion.
Astra said the deal would not impact its financial guidance for 2015. It is expected to generate Product Sales from 2016, with minimal earnings dilution over 2016 and 2017, before it becomes accretive to core earnings from 2018.

easyJet expects resilient demand to withstand security fears,easyJet,0.165,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-easyjet-results-idUKKCN0T60JQ20151117,www.reuters.com,EasyJet expects resilient demand to withstand security fears ,"LONDON (Reuters) - Heightened fears about travel in Europe are affecting easyJet but appetite for flights should return quickly and resilient general demand will underpin the airline’s growth, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
European travel is reeling from Friday’s attacks that killed at least 129 people in Paris, one of the world’s most visited cities, and a Russian plane crash over Egypt in October which halted flights from Britain to a popular Red Sea resort.
Travel to and from France has dropped off in the last few days and the number of “no show” passengers has risen, easyJet Chief Executive Carolyn McCall said after the airline reported an 18 percent rise in pretax profit for its 2015 financial year.
“You will always see a cooling-off period but you also see quite a quick resumption to travelling again,” McCall told reporters when asked about travel to and from France.
“What our own government and also what governments across Europe are doing is actually very reassuring for passengers. They are actually scrutinising airport security, now, probably after Paris, in a way that they’ve never done before,” she said.
Analysts estimate that France counts for about 20 percent of easyJet’s capacity.
The airline said the British government’s suspension of flights to the Egyptian resort of Sharm al-Sheikh due to concerns over security measures would have a “very, very small” impact on its full-year profits (in 2016)
Overall, for the coming year, the company said customers had continued to buy tickets at the same rate as last year and easyJet was confident profits would rise thanks to a 7 percent boost to passenger numbers this year and cost controls.
Shares in easyJet fell 5.0 percent to 1,695 pence, a decline analysts put down to the airline’s recent strong run. Its shares have climbed 13 percent in the last year while Britain’s blue-chip index which has lost 6 percent.
For the winter, easyJet’s bigger low-cost rival Ryanair has talked of a price war in the cut-throat European market as airlines raise capacity and compete against each other in a lower fuel cost environment.
McCall dismissed the talk, saying easyJet’s main competition was from airlines such as British Airways, Air France-KLM and others. easyJet forecast only a “slight decline” in revenue per seat on a constant currency basis for the six months to the end of March.
“Our airport overlap with Ryanair is between 5 and 6 percent. It doesn’t matter what they’re doing on price,” she said.
easyJet already has slots at major airports, an area where Ryanair is playing catch-up having historically focused on minor airports.
For its 2016 financial year, easyJet said current market expectations were in line with the board’s forecast.
Analysts expect the airline to make a pretax profit of 746 million pounds ($1.1 billion) next year, building on the 18 percent rise in pretax profit in 2015 to 686 million pounds.
The airline also said it would order 36 new planes as part of a decision to exercise rights to 30 A320 NEOs under a 2013 deal with Airbus, plus an order for six more current generation A320s.

* Beer volume down 3 pct in second quarter
* Company cites poor summer weather in China (Adds comments, background, bullet points, changes headline)
LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Poor summer weather in China hit SABMiller’s lager sales in the second quarter, though higher prices and a jump in soft drink sales helped boost revenues at the world’s second biggest beer maker.
The brewer of lagers such as Peroni and Miller Lite has been trying to offset sluggish growth in developed markets with cost cuts, marketing drives and acquisitions, while also putting more emphasis on soft drink sales in emerging markets.
Its strategy is the subject of great interest after an approach to buy Dutch rival Heineken was rebuffed last month, breathing life into long-running speculation SAB could soon be a target for the biggest brewer Anheuser Busch InBev .
SAB said overall revenues rose 3 percent in the three months to the end of September, though the volume of beer sold fell 3 percent, a reversal for its core, high-margin business after a 1 percent increase in the first quarter.
Including soft drinks, such as the ones SAB sells for Coca-Cola, total drinks volume was down 1 percent in the second quarter, with a 9 percent rise in soft drinks partly offsetting the decline in beer sales.
Soft drinks account for 20 percent of SABMiller’s sales volumes, but are far less profitable than beer.
“We wonder whether the underperformance of lager versus soft drink volumes will translate into margin pressure when first-half results are reported on Nov. 13,” said James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
In the Asia Pacific region, overall drinks volume fell 8 percent in the second quarter. Beer volume in China “declined markedly” during July and August because poor weather in most of the central provinces meant people drank less lager.
Total drinks volume in the second quarter also declined 2 percent in North America and 1 percent in Europe. It rose 5 percent in Latin America and 4 percent in Africa.
RBC analyst Edwardes Jones said there was “no sign here of the gradually improving trend we expect for the sector as a whole over the second half of 2014”.
Chief Executive Alan Clark called the results “resilient,” though they trailed estimates from some analysts such as Barclays, which expected lager volumes to fall just 1.1 percent in the second quarter.
“Our total beverage volume growth was impacted by weaker lager volume performance in the second quarter, balanced by strong growth in soft drinks,” Clark said in a statement.
Clark said weaker trading conditions in China and Australia had affected the company’s financial performance, as had adverse movements in foreign currencies.
SABMiller, which reports results in U.S. dollars, has been hurt by the relative weakness currencies such as the South African rand in recent months. The dollar was on a bull run throughout the three months to the end of September, rising nearly 8 percent against a basket of currencies.
SAB’s stock fell to 3,210.5 pence on Tuesday after the results, down 1.2 percent, or twice as much as the FTSE 100 index. The decline was, however, in line with the Stoxx Europe 600 Food & Beverage Euro Price Index.
SAB’s shares had soared to a historic high of 3,857 pence on Sept. 15, the day after the Heineken approach was revealed, as investors saw the move as defensive and a sign that the long-rumoured takeover by InBev might be imminent. SAB shares have fallen 17 percent since then.

UPDATE 2-Pricey beers lift SABMiller's quarterly underlying sales,SABMiller,0.429,https://www.reuters.com/article/sabmiller-results-idUSL8N1371MI20151112,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 2-Pricey beers lift SABMiller's quarterly underlying sales,"* Second-quarter revenue up 6 pct, volume up 2 pct
* Currency depreciation curbed sales, profits
* Says committed to performance, employees during takeover period (Adds comments by CEO, analyst)
LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Demand for higher-priced beers helped SABMiller to report a pick-up in quarterly underlying sales despite currency headwinds, a day after it formally received a $100-billion-plus takeover bid from industry leader Anheuser-Busch InBev.
The maker of beers such as Peroni and Grolsch said on Thursday its performance accelerated in the second quarter, with underlying revenue rising 6 percent and beverage volume up 2 percent from the prior year.
Fueled by strong gains in Africa and Latin America, and success in selling more higher-priced drinks including Castle Lite in South Africa and Cusquena in Peru, the results are an improvement from a 3 percent rise in revenue and flat volumes in the first quarter.
Yet SABMiller is being hammered by the weakness of various operating currencies including the Colombian peso, Australian dollar and South African rand, which make raw materials like barley and aluminum more expensive for local units, and then reduces the value of those units’ revenues.
“It’s a good business, but it’s under an awful lot of pressure,” Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling said, adding that currencies were a major reason for a decline in the share price earlier this year.
Its shares had fallen 18 percent in the four months to mid-September, when SABMiller revealed AB InBev’s approach. Many analysts say that decline had prompted AB InBev to finally launch a takeover offer that had been speculated about for years.
On a reported basis, including the currency impact, revenue fell 12 percent to $10.0 billion and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) fell 11 percent to $2.9 billion in the six months to Sept. 30.
SABMiller said growth would continue to be driven by developing markets and its focus on more premium drinks, though foreign exchange and higher raw material costs would still weigh on results.
It said it planned to deliver more than $430 million in annual savings by the end of its fiscal year, on 31 March 2016. That is ahead of its original target, for savings of $500 million by 2018.
“The SABMiller board does believe that our strategy would have delivered further value to our shareholders over the long term. However, AB InBev’s offer secures that value today, which is why the board unanimously recommended it,” SABMiller Chief Executive Alan Clark said on a conference call.
The takeover of the company, one of the largest in corporate history, is not expected to close until the second half of 2016, due to various antitrust approvals needed.
In the meantime, SABMiller said it was committed to keeping employees motivated, despite what Clark described as a general tone of uncertainty among staff around future job security.
He said the combination of its African soft drink bottling assets with those of Coca-Cola, a deal announced nearly a year ago, was on track to complete in coming months. He declined to say what would happen to the business after the takeover by AB InBev, which serves as a bottler for PepsiCo.
He also told reporters it was too early to talk about SABMiller’s stakes in France’s Castel Group and Turkey’s Anadolu Efes or his own career intentions following the takeover. (Reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by Jason Neely and Susan Thomas)

"Are Aviva plc, Direct Line Insurance Group PLC And Admiral Group plc Set To Soar?",Aviva,0.324,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-direct-line-trading-idUKKCN0SS0HF20151103,www.reuters.com,Direct Line's motor insurance prices beat expectations,"(Reuters) - Direct Line Insurance Group, Britain’s largest motor insurer, on Tuesday reported a bigger than expected rise in motor insurance prices for the third quarter, helping to boost its sales.
The insurer, whose brands include Churchill, Green Flag and Privilege, reported an 8.4 percent rise in risk-adjusted motor prices on Tuesday. It also said it had cut costs by 7 percent in the first nine months of the year.
Shares in Direct Line rose 1.3 percent to 396.4 pence, making the stock one of the top gainers on the blue chip FTSE-100 index.
Strong competition in British motor insurance has put pressure on prices in the past few years, partly because of the growth of price-comparison websites. But in the past few quarters prices have been increasing.
A benchmark survey by roadside assistance firm AA Plc showed a 4.8 percent increase in the third quarter in the Shoparound quote - an average of the five cheapest quotes returned from price comparison sites as well as direct insurers and brokers.
Data from price comparison website Confused.com and consultants Towers Watson & Co showed an 8.1 percent rise in motor premium prices for the period.
Direct Line said gross written premiums rose 3.1 percent to 844.5 million pounds ($1.3 billion) in the third quarter, with a 6.8 percent rise in gross written motor premiums.
“This is a good headline increase, and management indicate this is where they need to be to pricing to meet their target loss ratio,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.
Direct Line, which competes with Admiral Group, RSA Insurance and Aviva Plc, also said it had benefited from the absence of claims due to major weather events and was on track to achieve its 2015 targets.
On the new European capital rules for insurers that come in January 2016, Direct Line said it would use a standard model to measure its solvency levels, but would apply to Britain’s regulator to use a so-called ”internal model,” designed to cut capital costs, from mid-2016.

"EU drops Shell, BP, Statoil from ethanol benchmark investigation",Shell,0.276,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-biofuels-benchmarks-idUSKBN0TQ19720151207,www.reuters.com,"EU drops Shell, BP, Statoil from ethanol benchmark investigation","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have dropped Shell, BP, and Statoil from an investigation into suspected rigging of ethanol benchmarks, focusing instead on three producers of the biofuel.
The European Commission said on Monday it had opened a formal antitrust investigation into the actions of Spanish company Abengoa SA, Belgium’s Alcogroup SA and Lantmännen ek för of Sweden.
In April, EU antitrust regulators raided several bioenthanol companies and at the same time stepped up a two-year investigation into biofuel price benchmarks. In 2013, it searched the offices of BP, Shell and Statoil too.
BP, Shell, Statoil and price reporting agency Platts have been told they are not part of the investigation opened on Monday, two sources familiar with the matter said.
“The Commission’s investigation focuses on behaviors in price benchmarks for the ethanol sector,” the EU competition authority said in response to an email asking if crude oil and refined products were still being assessed.
“The Commission is currently not investigating further behaviors in price benchmarks for the crude oil sector.”
BP was not immediately available for comment, Shell declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Norwegian state producer Statoil said there were no formal charges or accusations against the company.
The Commission said it was concerned that Abengoa, Alcogroup and Lantmännen ek för may have colluded to manipulate ethanol benchmarks published by Platts.
It said this could include agreeing to submit or support bids to hike the benchmark and so drive up ethanol prices, leading to less use of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels, with negative consequences for consumers and the environment.
Platts said it had not been charged with any wrongdoing and was not an addressee of the European Commission’s statement of objections in relation to the bioethanol pricing investigation.
Alcogroup said: “Alcodis and Alcogroup operate their activities in accordance with European law and therefore fully cooperate with the European Commission whilst ensuring their fundamental rights to be respected.”
Lantmännen said it “cooperates fully with the authority”. Abengoa was not immediately available for comment.
In a separate case, the Commission is also investigating several bioethanol producers on suspicion of taking part in a cartel following searches of offices. The sources said the oil majors are not involved in this case either.
Ethanol is made from biomass such as wheat, maize or sugar beet that is mainly added to gasoline and used as a biofuel for certain motor vehicles.

AstraZeneca chases Acerta to secure next cancer drug winner,AstraZeneca,0.519,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acerta-m-a-astrazeneca-idINKBN0TX0P920151214,www.reuters.com,AstraZeneca chases Acerta to secure next cancer drug winner,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday it was in talks that might lead to the acquisition of privately held biotech firm Acerta Pharma, a potential $5 billion-plus deal designed to build up its cancer drug portfolio.
“AstraZeneca confirms that it is exploring potential strategic options with Acerta Pharma BV. There can be no certainty that any transaction will ultimately be entered into, or as to the terms of any transaction,” it said in a brief statement.
Credit Suisse analysts said acalabrutinib’s considerable potential could also encourage other potential buyers. “If Acerta is open to a transaction, we would expect significant interest from multiple other bidders,” they said in a note.
The Wall Street Journal had reported on Friday that the British drugmaker was looking to buy Acerta for more than $5 billion to gain access to its experimental blood cancer drug acalabrutinib.
Acalabrutinib works in a similar way to Imbruvica, which was developed by Pharmacyclics but is now controlled by AbbVie after the U.S. drugmaker bought Pharmacyclics for $21 billion earlier this year. Johnson & Johnson jointly markets Imbruvica.
Both drugs are so-called Burton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target an array of blood cancers and have the potential to become multibillion-dollar-a-year sellers, according to industry analysts. They may also help in autoimmune diseases like lupus.
Given pharmaceutical companies’ current heated interest in oncology, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said it was not surprising that Acerta, based in California and the Netherlands, was an acquisition candidate.
Acerta does not yet have a partner to help develop its leading drug, although it has agreed to test acalabrutinib in combination with Merck’s Keytruda.
Acerta is running a wide range of cancer clinical trials, including two final-stage Phase III studies. Last week it reported positive results in leukemia.
The decision to chase after Acerta reflects a determination by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot to use deals to boost his company’s pipeline as sales of older blockbusters, including cholesterol fighter Crestor, lose patent protection.
Last month he agreed to buy ZS Pharma, a specialist in treating high potassium levels, for $2.7 billion.
The biggest hopes are pinned on oncology, however, where AstraZeneca already has a goal of bringing six new cancer treatments to market by 2020.
Its new lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which it believes could sell $3 billion a year, was approved last month and the company also recently launched Lynparza for ovarian cancer.
Buying Acerta would take AstraZeneca into the less familiar territory of blood cancers and some analysts said the move suggested a bigger commitment to this area of oncology than initially expected.
Earlier this year AstraZeneca signed a deal to co-develop another cancer drug, durvalumab, in blood cancers with Celgene because it said at the time it had limited experience in the field.

LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s AstraZeneca has agreed to buy Takeda Pharmaceutical’s respiratory business, including expanded rights to roflumilast, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
AstraZeneca, which has marketed roflumilast in the United States under the name Daliresp since the first quarter of 2015, said it would pay $575 million to the Japanese company.
“Full acquisition of the global rights will support AstraZeneca’s respiratory franchise and complement the company’s portfolio of treatments for severe COPD,” AstraZeneca said.
Roflumilast, known as Daxas outside the US, is the only oral PDE4 inhibitor, a type of drug that has anti-inflammatory effects, approved for the treatment of COPD.
AstraZeneca acquired the US rights for the drug from Actavis earlier this year as part of a deal that bolstered its respiratory business, one of the company’s three main areas of focus.
Annual global sales of the three core medicines acquired -- Alvesco, Omnaris and Daxas -- were $198 million for the period ending in March 2015, AstraZeneca said.
Earlier on Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it would spend $800 million to expand its presence in China over the next 10 years.
Rothschild acted for Takeda on the deal.

Drugmaker Shire to buy Baxalta for $32 billion after 6-month pursuit,Shire,0.437,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baxalta-m-a-shire-idUSKCN0UP1CF20160111,www.reuters.com,Drugmaker Shire to buy Baxalta for $32 billion after six-month pursuit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Drugmaker Shire Plc SHP.L clinched its six-month pursuit of Baxalta International Inc BXLT.N on Monday with an agreed $32 billion cash and stock offer, catapulting it to a leading position in treating rare diseases.
The London-listed group, which first approached the U.S. company with an all-stock offer in July, won over the maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders after adding a cash sweetener.
Shire's U.S.-traded shares SHPG.O fell 9 percent, however, as investors worry about a potential competitive threat from Roche ROG.VX to Baxalta's critically important haemophilia franchise, and on nerves over the price offered and a cost savings forecast that Jefferies analysts called ""somewhat disappointing.""
The deal marks a strong start to mergers and acquisitions in healthcare in 2016 after the sector had its biggest deal-making streak in history last year, with global transactions totaling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
It also highlights the appeal of medicines for rare diseases targeting small groups of patients for which drugmakers can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
“Together we will have the number one platform in rare diseases with a strong foundation for future growth,” Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told reporters, after unveiling his company’s most ambitious acquisition yet.
Shareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 Shire American depositary share per Baxalta share, implying a total value of $45.57 per share based on Jan. 8 prices. That is 37.5 percent above Baxalta’s price on Aug. 3, before Shire went public with its interest.
Illinois-based Baxalta, which was spun off last year from Baxter International Inc BAX.N, rejected Shire's previous $30 billion all-stock offer in August, arguing it significantly undervalued the company. 
But Ornskov relentlessly pursued Baxalta, seeking to pressure it into agreeing to a deal by meeting with Baxalta’s major shareholders over a period of months.
That enabled it to sidestep a hostile deal in which it would have faced takeover defences including a “poison pill” that stopped unwanted suitors from buying more than 10 percent of the company and a hard-to-replace board.
Shares of Baxalta closed down 2.3 percent at $39.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, giving back earlier gains.
Shire had initially offered only stock due to concerns a cash element might jeopardize the tax-free status of Baxalta’s spin-off from Baxter. However, Ornskov said he was confident that adding $18 in cash would maintain this tax-free status.
“We came out without any doubt that this was not jeopardising the tax-free nature of the spin,” Ornskov said.
Together, the two companies said they expected to deliver double-digit sales growth with more than $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020.
With annual operating cost synergies of more than $500 million, additional revenue synergies and tax benefits from Shire’s Irish domicile, Shire said it expected the transaction to boost non-GAAP diluted earnings from 2017.
Baxalta brings Shire a strong position in haemophilia treatments, although that could face a serious challenge by late 2017 or 2018 from Roche’s experimental antibody ACE910 that received breakthrough designation - given to potentially important advances over current treatments - from U.S. health regulators. The Roche drug has a long half-life that could allow for less frequent dosing.
“A lot of people don’t like the deal” largely due to its dependence on Baxalta’s haemophilia franchise, said John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.
“They believe Shire is buying an asset that is going to be under pressure, so it may not reach the $20 billion revenue by 2020 target,” Boris said.
UBS analysts cautioned that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024.
Thanks to its base in Dublin, the combined company is expected to have an effective tax rate of 16 to 17 percent by 2017, down from around 23 percent for Baxalta, making the deal the latest transaction to result in lower tax rates.
Ornskov has stepped up his acquisition efforts in the rare diseases space after a planned takeover by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc ABBV.N fell through last year. He bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in February and Dyax for $5.9 billion in November.
Shire signed an $18 billion facility to help finance its latest purchase.
Shire was advised by Evercore, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Baxalta was advised by Goldman Sachs and Citi.
According to Freeman/Thomson Reuters estimates, Shire’s advisers could be in line for fees of $50 million-$60 million and Baxalta’s may earn $70 million-$80 million.
Baxalta said the termination fee on the Shire merger was equal to $369 million.

Some Wall Street analysts expressed disappointment with a promise of annual operating cost savings of over $500 million.
However, Flemming Ornskov, chief executive of Dublin-based Shire, said his style is to under promise and over deliver.
“Our internal synergy goals are much higher,” he said at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.
He also said the agreement that ended a six-month pursuit of Baxalta was not driven by cost savings or lower taxes. “This is a growth play,” he said.

By Danilo Masoni and Alistair Smout
MILAN/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday to their lowest since December 2014, hit by losses in commodity-related stocks as BHP Billiton announced a major writedown and oil fell below $30 a barrel.
Some investors said stocks were deeply oversold and flagged hopes of more central bank intervention to help reverse the trend after three straight week of losses.
BHP Billiton shed 6.8 percent, the top faller on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300, after saying it would write down the value of its U.S. shale assets by $7.2 billion. That cemented expectations the company will be forced to cut its dividend for the first time in more than 25 years.
The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index was down 6 percent, with Rio Tinto, Glencore and Antofagasta also among top fallers.
All four stocks also suffered from target price cuts by Japanese bank Nomura. Copper has hit a new 6-1/2 year low this week and was set for its second straight weekly loss.
The oil and gas sector was also under pressure, down 3.7 percent. Brent and U.S. crude both fell below $30 a barrel, as markets braced for more oil supply from Iran.
“Stocks are being driven by oil, and given that the Iranian sanctions are due to be lifted, that’s causing even more nervousness about this glut of oil that we have,” said Zeg Choudhry, managing director of LONTRAD.
Concerns over commodities and Chinese growth have marked a rocky start to the year for global markets. Chinese shares closed at their lowest level since December 2014, rocked again by falling oil.
The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 3 percent at 1,294.69 points by 1514 GMT, set for its third straight weekly loss. It fell 6.7 percent last week when China allowed its currency to devalue and is down another 1.7 percent.
Enrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy’s Consultinvest, said investors were testing central banks to see whether they had ammunition left to prop up markets and the economy.
“There is a symbolic poker match between the market and central banks. I don’t think China and oil are the real problem here,” he said “The market is trying to force the hand of central banks in the hope they unleash more stimulus. So far there has been no answer but at some point it will arrive.”
The European Central Bank holds its next policy meeting on Thursday.
Among other fallers, Brenntag dropped 5.1 percent after the chemicals firm was cut to “hold” from “buy” by Deutsche Bank.
The top riser was Syngenta, up 2.6 percent, following a Bloomberg report saying its board had voted in favour of pursuing advanced takeover talks with ChemChina.
H&M was up 1 percent after it posted a rise in sales in December which beat forecasts.

By Kit Rees and Atul Prakash
LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Britain’s top stock index retreated after hitting a three-week high earlier in Thursday’s session, led lower by Ashtead and commodity-related stocks.
Equipment rentals company Ashtead was the top faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, down over 6.5 percent on a read-across from U.S. peer United Rentals, which reported an underwhelming set of fourth-quarter results.
“Even though Ashtead are listed over here, they are predominantly a U.S.-exposed company,” Manoj Ladwa, head of trading at TJM Partners, said, adding that a slowdown in the U.S. market wasn’t helping the stock.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.9 percent at 6,939.63 points by 1226 GMT after earlier rising over 6,000.00, its highest since early January.
The benchmark index is still down nearly 5 percent following a commodities-led sell off earlier this year.
Also among the fallers was energy supplier Centrica, down 4.9 percent following a downgrade to “sell” by Societe Generale.
Aberdeen Asset Management fell 2.4 percent on a spate of broker downgrades after indicating on Wednesday that more clients pulled cash from its funds in the December quarter due to concerns about economic growth.
After rallying earlier in the session, commodity-related stocks trimmed their gains as the price of oil inched lower and the price of copper fell ahead of China’s New Year holiday, when activity in the world’s biggest consumer of copper and iron ore is expected to slow.
Shares in mining companies BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Glencore turned lower to trade between 0.1 to 2 percent down.
Shares in Anglo American, however, jumped over 9 percent after the company said it produced more iron ore last year. Iron ore is one of the biggest earners for Anglo American, which also produces coal, copper, platinum and diamonds.
The UK Oil and Gas index turned to trade slightly lower, up just 0.2 percent after the price of oil retreated slightly.
The mood remained fragile after the U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it was “closely monitoring” global economic and financial developments, signaling it had accounted for a stock market selloff but wasn’t ready to abandon a plan to tighten monetary policy this year.
Data showing that Britain’s economy ended 2015 on a soft note also didn’t aid sentiment. The annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years.
Among mid-caps, British transport company FirstGroup dropped more than 9 percent after it warned its annual profit would come in lower than it expected, citing wet weather and flooding in Britain and driver shortages in the United States. (Editing by Hugh Lawson)

Castagna said his bank’s choice of possible merger partners would be based in Italy’s north, so a tie-up with UBI, which has a strong presence in Lombardy, would tick that box. “It’s obvious that it is a deal that would make sense,” he said.
Asked about a possible tie-up with state-owned Monte dei Paschi di Siena, he said: “I think the government is working on (M&A options), and within the bank the management and the board are also working.

Shell share price: Standard Life announce position against BG acquisition,Shell,-0.134,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bg-m-a-shell-idUKKBN0UM22720160109,www.reuters.com,Shell's BG bid dealt blow with first shareholder dissent,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's RDSa.L bid to acquire BG Group BG.L was dealt a blow on Friday when a first major shareholder said it would vote against the $49 billion deal (34 billion pounds) due to a weak outlook for oil prices and risks related to BG's assets in Brazil.
Standard Life Investment’s announcement came on the same day influential shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) endorsed the deal, saying the downturn in oil markets did not detract from its strategic benefits.
The first public sign of dissent from a key investor was unlikely to scupper Chief Executive Ben van Beurden’s drive to win the required shareholder support in a Jan. 27 vote.
Few investors or analysts have openly challenged the deal’s strategic benefits for Shell, which will become the world’s top liquefied natural gas trader and a major offshore oil producer.
But with crude oil prices languishing near 12-year lows of around $34 a barrel and forecasts of a slow recovery, investors have raised concerns about the viability of the cash-and-share deal that would increase Shell’s debt burden.
“We have concluded that the proposed terms of the acquisition of BG are value destructive for Shell shareholders,” David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, said in a statement.
“This view is based on the downside risks to Shell’s oil price assumptions plus the tax and operational risks surrounding BG’s Brazilian asset base. Consequently we shall vote against the deal.”
A purchase of BG will increase Shell's exposure to risks in Brazil which is suffering its worse recession in decades. It will also bring Shell into closer partnership with Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, or Petrobras.
The state owned oil company is in the middle of a giant price-fixing, bribery and political kick-back scandal. Its nearly $130 billion of debt is also the largest of any oil company in the world and it faces increasing difficulty paying for massive offshore investments, many of them with BG.
Standard Life is the 11th largest holder of Shell’s B shares with a 1.7 percent stake. Shell B shares make up the share component in the cash-and-share acquisition that is expected to be completed on Feb. 15.
ISS, which advises around 5 percent of Shell’s medium and small shareholders, said they supported the deal “given the compelling strategic rationale, and the significant positive economics to be realised within a relatively short time frame.”
The current low oil price “may be of very little value in assessing the strategic opportunity of a transaction whose benefits will be realised over decades,” ISS said in a report.
Shell remained confident of winning the vote. “We continue to believe we have the broad base of shareholder support we need for the deal to complete,” a Shell spokesman said.
Guy Jubb, head of governance at Standard Life Investments, urged Shell to renegotiate the deal, announced last April.
On Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry told analysts Shell had conducted stress tests that showed it could withstand oil at $50 a barrel over the next two years, its lowest estimate to date as it seeks to secure shareholder support, sources told Reuters.
To weather such an environment, Shell plans to cut capital spending further below the planned $33 billion for 2016, delay share buybacks and extend scrip dividends, where investors are offered discounted shares instead of cash, Henry told analysts.
ISS said that the combination would allow Shell to replenish oil and gas reserves, lower production costs and ensure dividend cover “at what seems an opportunistic point” due to BG’s financial profile and the oil market’s cycle.
“There is credible evidence... that the price Shell is paying is reasonable even considering the decline in oil prices and oil stocks since the deal was announced.”
Royal Dutch Shell B shares were down 5.9 percent at 1757 GMT, compared with a 3.65 percent decline for the broader sector index. .SXEP

Tesco share price down as grocer faces SFO investigation outcome,Tesco,-0.542,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesco-accounts-sfo-idUSKBN0II17920141030,www.reuters.com,Britain's Fraud Office launches probe into Tesco accounting scandal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has opened a formal criminal investigation into accounting errors at Tesco TSCO.L, raising the stakes in a scandal that has hammered the reputation of the country's biggest grocer. 
Already battling challenges on multiple fronts, Tesco said on Wednesday it had been notified of the SFO’s new investigation into the 263 million-pound ($424 million) overstatement of its first-half profits that has led to the suspension of eight senior members of staff.
Tesco is already facing one proposed investor lawsuit in the United States over the accounting irregularities caused by booking deals with suppliers too early.
Britain’s accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, is also examining how the error came about.
Shares in Tesco, which had been up about 2 percent all day, fell initially on the news by half a percent before recovering to close up 2 percent at 172 pence.
When the SFO launches a full criminal investigation against a company or individuals it has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that conduct might involve serious or complex fraud or bribery.
Such investigations can take years to complete.
“The SFO confirmed today that the director has opened a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco plc,” the independent government department said in a statement.
Eight senior members of staff have been suspended by the company since the accounting errors came to light. Tesco said they remain employees and have been asked to step aside while the matter is investigated, adding that there was no suspicion of wrongdoing.
The 95-year-old group, which has dominated the British high street for years, is battling a severe slowdown in trading that has led to a string of recent profit warnings and resulted in a near halving of its market value this year.
Having only recently appointed a new chief executive and finance director and now looking for a new chairman, Tesco revealed in September it had found a 250 million-pound overstatement in its first-half profits, prompting investors to dump the stock.
Then last week the group said in its delayed first-half results that it now believed the accounting hole stretched to 263 million pounds.
Chief Executive Dave Lewis, just seven weeks into the job, also said he could no longer provide a full-year profit forecast because he did not know how much it would cost to rebuild the firm, Britain’s largest private employer.
The SFO probe will replace one already being carried out by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which will now be closed.
The agency will take months sifting through vast quantities of digital data and other evidence, while seeking to identify and trace witnesses.
Some investigations might qualify for a so-called Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA). This is effectively a suspended corporate sentence and a new string to the SFO’s bow that has yet to be tested.
But DPAs, the SFO has said, will only happen where it can persuade a judge that it is in the interests of justice and where a company cooperates fully and can show that it has put any misdemeanour behind it and removed offending personnel.

* Next falls 5.2 pct on weak sales
By Kit Rees
Jan 5 LONDON (Reuters) - British shares edged higher on Tuesday after beginning the year in negative territory, with Royal Mail and grocer Tesco both benefiting from upgrades on their stock.
Royal Mail was the top riser on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, up 2.5 percent after Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded its rating on the stock, citing in-line earnings in November and good progress on cost savings.
The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent at 6,111.09 points by 0939 GMT, having fallen more than 2 percent in the previous session, its worst first trading day of the year since 2000.
The index outperformed the broader European market on Tuesday.
Tesco was up 1.2 percent on the back of an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” from Deutsche Bank.
Shares in rival supermarket operator Morrison, which advanced 0.2 percent, were likewise supported by an upgrade from Deutsche Bank, which increased its rating on the stock to “hold” from “sell”.
After a sell-off in the previous session following weak Chinese manufacturing data, the UK FTSE 350 Mining index recovered some of its losses to trade up 0.3 percent.
Metals prices rebounded after Chinese shares stabilised following a highly volatile session on Monday.
Miners Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto all rose between 0.2 and 2.2 percent. Mid-cap natural resources company Vedanta Resources gained 3.2 percent.
“The general feeling is that they might be approaching the bottom of their current trend, but it’s a brave investor who tries to call (it at) this particular moment in time,” Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargeaves Lansdown, said.
Among the retailers, however, Next dropped 5.2 percent after the company reported disappointing sales in the run-up to Christmas, blaming poor stock availability, increased online competition and unusually warm weather in November and December for a slowdown that could hit the wider sector.
“Holders will be happy to receive another 60p special dividend ... thanks to good cashflow, but sceptics might not like a worse net debt position and what amounts to a challenging environment in which to be a retailer,” Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said in a note.
Fellow grocer Marks and Spencer, which is due to report on Thursday, also declined, by 1.3 percent. (Reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Susan Fenton)

Amazon to attack UK grocery market with Morrisons deal,Morrisons,0.333,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morrison-supermk-amazon-com-idUSKCN0W20NO,www.reuters.com,Amazon to attack UK grocery market with Morrisons deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon has launched its biggest foray into food outside of the United States with a deal with British supermarket Morrisons to offer fresh and frozen goods to customers, in some places as quickly as under one hour.
Enabling the online retail giant to compete with Britain’s biggest supermarket stores and smallest local shops, the deal opens another front on Amazon’s assault on the 178 billion pounds ($247 billion) British grocery market, already hammered by a brutal price war and changing shopping habits.
Amazon will now add hundreds of fresh and frozen products to its existing offering of packaged grocery goods, setting it up to take on Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Wal-Mart’s Asda, as well as online specialist Ocado, in one of the world’s most developed online retail markets.
“The advance of Amazon as a participant in UK grocery is a potential challenge to the whole trade, in time,” Shore Capital retail analyst Clive Black said on Monday. “Any new entrant is, but particularly the American behemoth.”
The tie-up boosted shares of Morrisons, Britain’s fourth largest supermarket, which has been a laggard in online sales. Since 2013 it has outsourced logistics for its own online food business to Ocado.
Morrisons shares rose 5.6 percent. Those of Ocado fell 9.3 percent on fears the deal would increase competition and reduce the likelihood that Amazon could one day buy it. Market leader Tesco’s shares fell by 3 percent.
“Tesco could soon be about to find out what it’s like to be David rather than Goliath,” said Retail Vision consultant John Ibbotson. Amazon has a market cap of $261 billion.
The UK grocery market has been convulsed in recent years by thrifty shoppers turning to discounters Aldi and Lidl, convenience stores and online shops. The British Retail Consortium predicts that 900,000 retail jobs could go by 2025 as the industry moves online.
Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, launched a fresh food offering in Seattle in 2007 and has moved to a handful of other U.S. cities since then, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model, with fresh food proving one of the toughest nuts to crack.
After waiving the membership fee for several years, Amazon finally said last year it would begin charging customers $299 a year for its Prime Fresh membership in the U.S.
Its expansion into food in the rest of the world has focused so far just on packaged goods due to the complexity of delivering fresh and frozen products. However, it is keen to extend its offering, just as supermarkets are increasingly competing on its home turf by selling more non-food products online.
The Morrisons tie-up stops short of replicating its broader U.S. Amazon Fresh service, which offers about 20,000 chilled, frozen and perishable products and items from local shops that analysts have long speculated Amazon was targeting for the UK.
But it gives Amazon a platform to attack a UK online grocery market predicted to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD.
It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November it extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Amazon Prime subscription members in Britain. Last year it added a small range of chilled and frozen items to its Prime Now service which offers one-hour delivery in Britain’s two biggest cities.
Amazon has also begun surveying UK customers about their use of restaurant delivery services, in what analysts said was likely the first step in an international expansion of a business it rolled out in the U.S last September.
Morrisons, with a smaller footprint in the more affluent areas of London and the south east of England than Tesco and Sainsbury’s, may have gambled that it could cope better with the arrival of Amazon which would typically target those areas.
Morrisons makes half of all the own brand and fresh food it sells, a greater share than other British supermarkets, and has spare capacity to service Amazon’s needs.
Morrisons announced separate plans on Monday to extend its own online grocery deliveries to the whole of the UK, in agreement with Ocado. It would take space in a new Ocado London warehouse while Ocado will provide Morrisons with software to fulfill online orders from its own stores.
For Morrisons, a tie-up with outside giants like Amazon might be described as “letting the barbarians in”, said analysts at brokerage Bernstein.
Nevertheless, the deal could be “a convenient divide-and conquer outcome where Amazon and Morrisons specialize where they are best and support each other mutually,” Bernstein said.
“Morrisons may feel that Amazon isn’t really a threat for its smaller stores in the North of England; on the contrary on our recent store visit, we saw a nice new shiny Amazon locker unit for picking up Amazon parcels.”

AstraZeneca share price: Acerta deal pays off with orphan drug status,AstraZeneca,0.495,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-cancer-idUSKCN0VY139,www.reuters.com,AstraZeneca's $4 billion Acerta deal endorsed by orphan drug status,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca's AZN.L bold move to buy 55 percent of privately held biotech firm Acerta Pharma for $4 billion in December has been vindicated, at least in part, by the award of special ""orphan"" status to the key experimental drug involved.
The drugmaker said on Thursday that the European Medicines Agency had recommended acalabrutinib as an orphan product for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
Orphan status is awarded to medicines promising significant benefit in the treatment of rare, life-threatening diseases and the designation provides companies with special development and market exclusivity incentives.
AstraZeneca bought control of Acerta to get its hands on acalabrutinib, which it believes could generate sales of more than $5 billion a year. The drug is currently in the final stages of clinical development for various blood cancers.
Acalabrutinib works in a similar way to AbbVie ABBV.N and Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N Imbruvica. But AstraZeneca reckons it has fewer side effects than Imbruvica and potentially better efficacy. Rival drugs are further behind in development.
Acerta shareholders will have the option to sell the remaining 45 percent of shares in the biotech company to AstraZeneca for approximately $3 billion once acalabrutinib has been approved in both the United States and Europe.
The new medicine is a so-called Burton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets an array of blood cancers and potentially some solid tumors. It may also help in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

"BHP Billiton slashes dividend, posts $5.67 billion net loss",BHP Billiton,-0.341,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bhpbilliton-results-idUSKCN0VV2EJ,www.reuters.com,"BHP Billiton slashes dividend, posts $5.67 billion net loss","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Top global miner BHP Billiton BHP.AXBLT.L slashed its interim dividend by 75 percent on Tuesday, abandoning a long-held policy of steady or higher payouts as it braces for a longer-than-expected commodities downturn.
The end to BHP’s so-called progressive dividend policy came as the world’s biggest diversified miner slumped to a net loss of $5.67 billion for the six months to Dec. 31, its first loss in more than 16 years.
“We need to recognize we are in a new era, a new world and we need a different dividend policy to handle that,” Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said on a media call, warning of a prolonged period of weaker prices and higher volatility.
The dividend cut to 16 cents was more severe than market expectations for a payout as high as 35 cents. BHP pledged a minimum 50 percent payout of underlying profit going forward.
“Given months of anguish and market debate regarding the dividend, we expect that 16 cents while disappointing, is a cash flow positive and therefore will likely be absorbed by the market,” said Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O’Connor.
Mackenzie said the shift was part of a broader strategy to help BHP Billiton manage volatility.
“The financial flexibility we will gain as a company from this move ... will allow us to invest counter cyclically,” he said. “It will allow us to look at tier one assets in distress.”
Standard & Poor’s cut BHP’s credit rating to ‘A’ from ‘A+’ this month and warned it might downgrade again if the company failed to take more steps to preserve cash and review its dividend policy.
“I can’t see (the ratings agencies) downgrading. They probably would have if the commodity outlook was still poor, but I think the outlook is starting to turn in BHP’s favor,” said Fat Prophets mining analyst David Lennox.
Mackenzie also announced a revamp of BHP’s corporate structure in a bid to simplify operations, creating U.S. and Australian mineral divisions in a move that will see its iron ore chief Jimmy Wilson and petroleum head Tim Cutt depart.
BHP shares rose 2.5 percent to $17.62 by early afternoon in a slightly weaker overall market..AXJO
Australian Shareholders Association director Geoffrey Bowd said the dividend cut was “very prudent” in light of the commodities outlook.
Shares in close peer Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L have risen some 9 percent since it swapped its progressive dividend policy for a payout ratio on Feb. 11. 
Underlying attributable profit plunged to $412 million from $4.89 billion a year earlier, missing analysts’ forecasts for around $585 million, as commodities prices plummeted to multi-year lows.
“While the miss looks big in percentage terms, the numbers are quite frankly disappointingly low anyway,” said Shaw’s O’Connor, pointing to BHP’s $100 billion asset base.
Despite the tough outlook, Mackenzie said BHP was still generating EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins of 40 percent, which is ahead of the reported figure of around 34 percent for Rio Tinto.
At today’s spot prices, the company would expect to generate $10 billion in operating cash flow for the year, he said.
BHP's results included an after tax charge of $858 million following a dam disaster in Brazil at its Samarco joint venture with Vale VALE5.SA, which killed 17 people in that country's worst environmental disaster.
A total of $6.1 billion of exceptional items included an impairment charge of $4.9 billion against the carrying value of its U.S. onshore oil and gas assets and $390 million for global taxation matters
Mackenzie said there were no immediate plans to expand shale operations in the United States, but BHP remained committed to the business.

NYSE owner ICE may gatecrash Deutsche Boerse-LSE merger,LSE,-0.2,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lse-m-a-interconti-exc-idUSKCN0W33SQ,www.reuters.com,NYSE owner ICE may gatecrash Deutsche Boerse-LSE merger,"(Reuters) - New York Stock Exchange owner ICE ICE.N said it may make a rival bid for London Stock Exchange LSE.L, raising the prospect of a takeover battle with Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE and lifting LSE shares to a record high on Tuesday. 
The announcement by Intercontinental Exchange Inc is the latest development in a long string of mergers, bidding wars and failed deals among global exchanges.
The industry has been trying to consolidate for years amid weaker trading volumes and shrinking margins. Instead of stock trading, the exchanges have focused on more profitable businesses, such as derivatives trading and selling market data.
But regulatory concerns about the concentration of power in the hands of a few exchanges, along with nationalist wrangling, have hindered many cross-border deals.
LSE Chief Executive Xavier Rolet has been one of the most vocal advocates of consolidation. In December he laid out his vision of global exchange consolidation, saying he expected three to five “exchange powerhouses” in North America, Europe and Asia.
Whether ICE will follow through with a bid for LSE is not certain. The Atlanta-based exchange said it had not yet approached LSE and may not pursue a deal at all. Nonetheless, news of its interest pushed up share prices of exchanges across Europe.
While Deutsche Boerse is interested in combining with LSE to create a full-service trading powerhouse, analysts said, ICE’s interest likely relates to two of LSE’s businesses: Clearing and market data. After acquiring NYSE in 2013, ICE kept the New York Stock Exchange and its mainly European-focused derivatives unit, Liffe, but sold off other substantial parts of NYSE’s business.
ICE had attempted in 2010 to buy NYSE together with Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O. The two exchanges placed a bid to rival Deutsche Borse's, when the German exchange attempted to buy the Big Board. Regulatory concerns ultimately foiled both Deutsche Borse's and Nasdaq's attempts.
Those concerns still carry relevance today.
LSE and Deutsche Boerse are already walking a political tight-rope between London and Frankfurt as they hammer out terms of their agreed merger. Political and regulatory demands may be even more strenuous if a non-European exchange tries to buy LSE.
CME Group CME.O is actively considering doing so, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts suggested that Euronext NV ENX.PA and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 0388.HK may also be interested. All three declined to comment.
“It’s going to force anybody that has been potentially looking at (LSE) to step up or go away,” said Numis Securities analyst Jonathan Goslin.
The proposed tie-up of Deutsche Boerse and LSE, which was announced last week, would be an all-stock merger. It would give Deutsche Boerse shareholders a 54.4 percent stake in the new company. However, rival bidders could force Deutsche Boerse to offer a bigger premium or bow out.
Deutsche Boerse said it had seen ICE’s statement but indicated it was not looking to alter its proposed offer, while LSE confirmed it had not received a proposal from ICE. “The company is continuing its merger talks with LSE with no change,” Deutsche Boerse said in a statement.
Sources familiar with the proposed tie-up said the pair are betting that they stand a stronger chance of winning approval from European governments and regulators, than if a U.S. operator were involved.
“Deutsche Boerse and LSE are banking on political backing from Brussels, Berlin and probably also London for a ‘European deal’ that might support the planned EU capital markets union,” one source said.
The source said Rolet still has faith in the Deutsche Boerse deal, even if a rival comes through with a richer offer, although analysts said an all-cash deal would be difficult to turn down.
“Our suspicion is that ICE or CME will derail the Deutsche-Boerse-LSE love affair only by offering cash,” independent research firm AlphaValue said in a note to clients.
Shares of LSE, which had a market value of $13 billion at Monday’s close, rose as much as 9 percent to 2,918 pence.
ICE shares were down about 3 percent at $231.26 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of CME Group Inc CME.O were up 1 percent at $92.38 on the Nasdaq.
The German company’s shares ended regular trading at 76.87 euros, up 0.9 percent.
ICE must make an offer for LSE no later than March 29. Under British takeover rules, Deutsche Boerse must either make a formal offer or announce it will not do so by March 22, unless it gets an extension from the UK mergers regulator. Rolet plans to retire if LSE’s planned merger with its German rival goes ahead.

LSE-Deutsche Boerse merger would signal end to exchange mega-deals,LSE,0.105,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-exchanges-m-a-idUSKCN0W91V1,www.reuters.com,LSE-Deutsche Boerse merger would signal end to exchange mega-deals,"LONDON (Reuters) - If the merger between London Stock Exchange LSE.L and Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE goes ahead, it could be the final mega-deal in the industry as further combinations of such scale are likely to hit antitrust buffers.
The two companies will seek to overcome the kind of regulatory concerns that scuppered Deutsche Boerse’s attempt to merge with NYSE Euronext four years ago, a deal blocked because it would have created a near-monopoly on exchange-traded derivatives in Europe.
They could argue there is less overlap between certain business lines in any one region, namely Europe, say industry experts; for example while Deutsche Boerse has a big European derivatives trading operation, LSE is largely absent from that business.
If the deal is cleared it would create a ""Big Four"" of trading powerhouses that outstrip rivals in terms of market value and global reach - ICE ICE.N and CME CME.O in the United States, LSE-DB in Europe and Asia's Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 0388.HK.
Each would have such large global operations in shares and derivatives trading, as well as indices and clearing, that any argument that business lines do not overlap could not prevail again, say industry officials and analysts.
“The very big players are already starting to be in danger of running into antitrust anywhere they go,” said Patrick Young, a consultant to exchanges since the days of the first LSE-Deutsche Boerse tie up proposal back in 2000.
“We are coming to the point where the great exchanges merger game is coming to an end, the great powers have been defined.”
Regulators would be unlikely to allow the CME and ICE to merge, for instance, given a combined group would have a near-unassailable position in U.S. securities trading.
It is also unlikely that ICE would be allowed to buy a combined LSE-Deutsche Boerse group as this would create an effective monopoly of listed derivatives trading in Europe, say analysts.
It would also be hard to envisage the Chinese government allowing a foreign exchange take over Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, they said.
If the LSE deal goes ahead, any big exchange looking to expand might instead have to look to hoovering up smaller peers.
“There is no one else left to buy up. It would be a range of mega exchanges buying a couple of selective, medium-sized exchanges,” said Brian Taylor of BTA Consulting, which advises exchanges.
In Europe, smaller exchanges themselves such as Euronext ENX.PA and BME BME.MC would be forced to respond to the increased competition from a combined LSE-Deutsche Boerse to avoid being squeezed out, said Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser in London at Fidessa, which builds trading systems.
“All those medium-sized exchange groups ... will be forced to find an answer,” he said. “If you are stuck in such a position, you either have to start to grow or focus on a niche or specialty areas so that you can differentiate yourself.”
A source close to France-based Euronext, which was split from NYSE in 2014, said continuing with its strategy of maintaining its independence was no longer tenable, even if the LSE-Deutsche Boerse merger did not go ahead.
Euronext and Spain’s BME declined to comment.
A London-Frankfurt merger could also pose problems for U.S. exchange Nasdaq NDAQ.O. It would risk falling further and further behind a Big Four as it does not have the same global reach or a strong presence in derivatives trading and clearing - among the industry's highest-growth and margin businesses. 
“I do think that (LSE-DB) would be pretty much the last of the mega mergers and poses an interesting question for Nasdaq. Do they need to do a deal, what is their focus?” said Rich Daniels, senior analyst at TABB Group in New York.
Nasdaq declined to comment.
Until the slowdown in China’s economy, Asia was seen as a promised land for western exchanges wanting to tap the region’s growth and realize a dream of becoming truly global platforms.
However national political barriers make foreign takeovers in Asia more difficult than elsewhere, BTA Consulting’s Taylor said. In 2011 Australia banned an attempt by the Singapore Exchange to buy the Australian Stock Exchange to avoid a foreign country having too much sway in its financial center.
Analysts say Asian exchanges are more likely to snap up western peers rather than the other way round.
The Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing bought the London Metal Exchange in 2012, while Singapore’s SGX exchange is among the suitors for London’s Baltic Exchange.
“I don’t think any country in Asia is ready to open up to foreign ownership,” TABB Group’s Daniels said. “I don’t think that politically it is time for Asia to be part of truly global consolidation.”
CLEARING & BREXIT
The proposed London-Frankfurt merger has not yet been formally put to regulators, but a major area of competition concern could be derivatives clearing, as LSE’s LCH.Clearnet and Deutsche Boerse’s Eurex Clearing are already the dominant players in Europe.
Industry experts said the British company could spin off the French half of its clearing house in a bid to assuage regulators.
LSE and Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.
A core reform from the global financial crisis is forcing large chunks of the world’s $550 trillion derivatives market to pass through a clearing house to complete the trade even if one side of the transaction goes bust.
The lucrative service becomes mandatory for interest rate swaps in the European Union from June, and ICE and CME have both opened clearing houses in the region in the past five years.
“A DB-LSE tie-up would create a European clearing powerhouse that would pose more challenges for U.S.-based ICE and CME in building a European swaps and futures business,” Benn Steil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank in New York.
But other factors could also shape the industry’s European landscape, such as if Britain, home to the region’s biggest financial center, votes in June to back “Brexit” and leave the European Union.
The EU is putting in place reforms to create a capital markets union to help companies raise more money by issuing bonds and floating on stock exchanges, but exchanges would need to have a presence in the bloc to exploit this.
While the LSE and Deutsche Boerse say their merger would be Brexit-proof, Britain leaving the EU could force other exchanges with European headquarters in London - such as BATS Chi-X, ICE and CME - to review where they should be based.

FTSE edges up as investors cheer Kingfisher results,Kingfisher,0.678,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-stocks/ftse-edges-up-as-investors-cheer-kingfisher-results-idUKKCN0WP109,www.reuters.com,FTSE edges up as investors cheer Kingfisher results,"LONDON (Reuters) - UK shares advanced on Wednesday as Kingfisher, Europe’s largest home improvement retailer, beat profit expectations and investors dipped back into the travel sector.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 .FTSE was up 6.37 points, or 0.1 percent at 6,198.50 points by the close. Trade was quiet, with volumes at just three-quarters of the 90-day average.
Kingfisher KFG.L, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and as Castorama and Brico Depot in France and other markets, gained 5.9 percent on the back of a forecast-beating 0.3 percent rise in annual profit. It had announced a strategy overhaul in January. 
“There was some initial disdain for Kingfisher’s turnaround plan but today’s results confirm the company has gotten a head start over its rival Homebase,” said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets.
Sky Plc SKYB.L also rose 2.4 percent after investment bank Exane BNP Paribas upgraded its rating on the stock to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"".
Investors bought back into travel stocks, which recovered after a sell-off in the previous session following deadly attacks in Brussels.
Shares in cruise operator Carnival CCL.L, International Hotels Group IHG.L, tour operator TUI TUIT.L and airlines easyJet EZJ.L and IAG ICAG.L were all up between 0.7 percent and 1.9 percent.
Mid-cap Thomas Cook TCG.L, which was also pulled lower on Tuesday by news of a fall in bookings in the previous session, regained ground to trade up 2.9 percent.
“You have the usual bit of aggressive bargain-hunting coming through in these sectors, (they were) quite heavily sold down yesterday,” IG analyst Chris Beauchamp said.
Miners and oil & gas stocks fell, as metals and crude prices suffered from a rise in the dollar and concerns about a market oversupply.
Mid-cap William Hill WMH.L slumped 11 percent, its biggest daily loss in 7-1/2 years, after issuing a profit warning for 2016.

Barclays Bonds Rise as Lender Cuts Dividends to Shore Up Capital,Barclays,0.261,https://www.reuters.com/article/banks-dividends-idINL6N0G12MF20130808,www.reuters.com,European banks promise high dividends in low-yield world,"LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - European banks redoubled their commitment to raise dividends this results season, determined to demonstrate to investors that they have put the financial crisis behind them.
The ability to pay a dividend has become a badge of honour among banks since regulators raised the bar on capital requirements in recent months, requiring some lenders to issue equity or bonds or to sell assets to shore up their ratios.
Barclays softened the blow of a 5.8 billion pound rights issue with a pledge to pay shareholders more than 3 billion pounds a year by distributing 30-50 percent of earnings compared with a previous pledge of 30 percent.
“In banking, where having capital is so precious, paying a dividend is far more important as a signal of health than it is in other industries,” said Simon Maughan, analyst at Olivetree Securities.
With interest rates set to remain close to zero in the euro-zone and Britain, any stock paying a dividend that yields 4 percent or more is an attractive option for wealthy individuals, pension funds and retail investors, as well as income investors who pick stocks primarily for their dividend.
Swedbank, HSBC, Standard Chartered , BNP Paribas and Nordea are all expected to deliver a 4 percent or more yield this year.
Shares in Lloyds, UBS and Societe Generale all rallied in the last two weeks on hopes they will ramp up payouts next year.
“We are moving in the direction of capital returns, which is a sign of increasing normality after such a long period of capital injections and state intervention,” said Amit Goel, analyst at Credit Suisse in London.
With loan growth muted, banks have some leeway to increase dividends. Raising payouts is also a way for banks with surplus capital to boost their return on equity, by reducing the capital returns are based on, although few are yet in that position.
Indeed, meeting capital requirements remains the crux of how far and how quickly banks lift payouts.
UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank all said they want to lift dividends, but all stayed cautious in light of tougher leverage ratio rules.
UBS’s strong capital generation got investors excited, however. Its core capital jumped to 11.2 percent from 10.1 percent just three months earlier, and the bank will add up to 90 basis points from buying back a fund of its toxic assets.
It plans to pay out more than half its earnings in dividends when its core capital gets above 13 percent, which could see it pay 1.75 Swiss francs per share for 2015, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, equivalent to a yield of 10 percent.
Several British, French and Scandinavian banks were bullish on payouts, including part-nationalised Lloyds, whose shares surged after progress in its turnaround left it able to start talks with regulators about restarting its dividend, which it has not been able to pay since being bailed out in 2008.
Lloyds could pay a final dividend for this year in early 2014, and should see payouts increase to 4 pence a share for 2015, analysts reckon, which would be a yield of over 5 percent.
That would see it distributing 50-70 percent of its earnings in dividends, higher than most rivals, and is seen as a key selling point to new potential investors as Britain prepares to sell down its 39 percent stake.
Lloyds paid out just over half of its profit in dividends in 2005 and 2006 and the shares yielded 6.5-7 percent.
“Lloyds will be a high dividend bank stock in the future because a small portion of our earnings will be necessary to sustain loan growth, and all the rest ... will be able to flow into shareholders,” Lloyds Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said. “We’ll see how much in due time.”
Buoyant results from France’s Societe Generale pave the way for higher dividends and sparked a jump in its shares. CEO Frederic Oudea said SocGen’s payout ratio was likely to rise from 25 percent this year to 35-50 percent in 2014.
Dividends across the industry slumped during the financial crisis, but analysts at Barclays forecast payouts by 28 of Europe’s top lenders will rise to more than 32 billion euros next year, up 50 percent from last year’s level but almost a third below the peak in 2007.
Some see the dividend optimism as overdone, however. Banks will need to keep lofty capital levels and face ongoing regulatory headwinds and continue to deal with a raft of legacy issues, including Lloyds.
And while the prospect Lloyds could pay out 70 percent of its profits excited investors, not everyone was impressed.
“Payout ratios of around 70 percent suggest the business is ex-growth, because you’re giving almost the entire thing back to your shareholders,” HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver said.

Britain's FTSE gets lift from Prudential results,Prudential,0.582,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-stocks-idUKKCN0WB10Q,www.reuters.com,FTSE gets lift from Prudential results,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index rose on Wednesday, boosted by a rise in insurer Prudential after it announced a special dividend with results that beat expectations.
Prudential rose 2.9 percent, the top FTSE 100 riser, after its profit was lifted by strong performances at its British, U.S. and Asian life businesses.
“Overall Prudential remains in good shape and ... has allayed investor concerns on management’s ability to deliver on strategy,” said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers.
“The announcement of a special dividend and 5 percent increase of the ordinary dividend has been well received.”
Britain’s FTSE 100 index was up 0.3 percent at 6,146.32 points at its close.
British mining company Glencore recovered some of the previous session’s heavy losses to trade up 2.5 percent, with investors citing bargain hunters dipping back into the stock following the sell-off.
“We could find that the bounce today is fairly short-lived and it starts to shift back down again. Around these sorts of levels, you’d think Glencore is probably in no man’s land,” Manoj Ladwa, head of trading at TJM Partners, said.
Shares in energy provider SSE also rose, up 2.3 percent after JP Morgan upgraded its rating on the company to “overweight” from “underweight”, citing a “diversified, defensive, cash-generative business mix”.
Among fallers, luxury goods company Burberry Group dropped 6.7 percent, reversing gains made in the previous session on bid rumours, as HSBC cut its rating to “hold” from “buy”.
Construction equipment rental company Ashtead retreated 1 percent after it was downgraded to “underperform” from “outperform” by Credit Suisse.
“(We) conclude that, independent of the demand outlook, risks are building around rental rates,” analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note, slashing its target price to 770 pence from 1,300 pence. Berenberg and JP Morgan also cut their target price on the stock.
Mid-caps underperformed blue chips, with the FTSE 250 index down 0.4 percent, hit by disappointing updates from Restaurant Group and G4S.
Restaurant Group plunged 22.7 percent to its lowest in two years after providing a disappointing outlook for the forthcoming year.
G4S dropped 12.1 percent after it took an extra charge related to British government contracts.
“Security group G4S failed to woo investors with an increased dividend as attention remained fixed on losses on its government contract to house asylum seekers,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said in a note.
Among risers, Cairn Energy rose 13.3 percent after announcing better-than-expected results from a well in Senegal.

Aviva weighs cash handout after beating profit forecast,Aviva,0.377,https://www.reuters.com/article/aviva-results-idUSL5N16I1KV,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Aviva weighs cash handout after beating profit forecast,"(Releads, adds quotes, details, share price)
LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Aviva chief executive Mark Wilson said on Thursday the insurer could give cash back to shareholders, after it beat forecasts with a 20 percent 2015 operating profit rise.
Aviva reported a solvency capital ratio under new European rules of 180 percent, at the top of its 150-180 percent target range. A ratio of 100 percent shows insurers have sufficient capital to cover underwriting, investment and operational risks.
Wilson said the company’s strong capital position meant it could grow businesses organically, and reiterated it could also make “bolt-on” acquisitions in markets such as Poland.
“Capital returns to shareholders are also on our radar,” he said on a media call following the results.
Aviva’s shares rose 4 percent to 478 pence at 0825 GMT, the top performer in the FTSE 100 index.
Aviva bought rival Friends Life last year in a 5.6 billion pound deal, creating a market leader in life insurance.
The life and general insurer said it would achieve its target of 225 million pounds in integration synergies in 2016, a year ahead of schedule, and that it expected 1.2 billion pounds in capital synergies.
“The key question now is what will Aviva do with the additional cash - we think it will in part be used to hike future dividends,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon, in a note.
Aviva’s operating profit of 2.7 billion pounds came in above expectations of 2.49 billion pounds from a forecast compiled by the insurer.
Its combined operating ratio, a key measure of performance in its general insurance business, strengthened to 94.6 percent, against a forecast of 96 percent. A level below 100 percent indicates an underwriting profit.
Aviva said floods in Britain in December had cost it 132 million pounds.
The company said it would pay a final dividend of 14.05 pence per share and total dividend of 20.8 pence, up 15 percent from 2014 but below a forecast of 21.2 pence. ($1 = 0.7047 pounds) (Editing by Sinead Cruise and Alexander Smith)

"Saudi Aramco, Shell plan to break up Motiva, divide up assets",Saudi Aramco,-0.142,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-motiva-aramco-shell-idUSKCN0WI2XC,www.reuters.com,"Saudi Aramco, Shell plan to break up Motiva, divide up assets","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Saudi Aramco announced plans on Wednesday to break up Motiva Enterprises LLC in a deal that ends a partnership of nearly two decades and hands control of the biggest U.S. refinery to the Saudi state oil giant.
News that the two energy companies will divide assets in their oil refining and marketing joint venture had been expected by many as they navigated an often-frayed relationship where their respective interests sometimes diverged.
An early sign of a pending breakup emerged last summer when Motiva announced plans to set up its own oil products trading operation separate from Shell. The desk started up in January.
The divorce also comes as the Saudi government considers selling shares in the world’s largest oil firm.
Abdulrahman Al-Wuhaib, senior vice president of downstream at Saudi Aramco, said in a statement on Wednesday that the joint venture formed in 1998 served the partners’ downstream business objectives “very well for many years.”
“It is now time for the partners to pursue their independent downstream goals,” he said.
A U.S. spokesman for The Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell said the breakup and split of Motiva’s assets were consistent with Shell’s plans to simplify its global portfolio.
Motiva’s three refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast region have a combined capacity of over 1.1 million barrels per day, located within a 120-mile (195-km) radius of one another. The marketing operations support a network of about 8,300 Shell-branded gasoline stations in the Eastern and Southern United States.
The partners said that under the terms of a non-binding letter of intent, Aramco would take over the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and retain 26 distribution terminals as well as the Motiva name.
It will also have an exclusive license to use the Shell brand for gasoline and diesel sales in Texas, the majority of the Mississippi Valley, the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, it said.
Shell will solely own the Louisiana refineries in Convent and Norco, where it also operates a chemicals plant, as well as Shell-branded gasoline stations in Florida, Louisiana and the Northeastern region.
A Shell spokesman said the company would move forward with Motiva’s plan to integrate the Louisiana refineries to operate as a single 500,000-bpd plant.
While sources close to the situation say the relationship between Shell and Aramco has been troubled, that tension grew after an ambitious $10 billion expansion of Motiva's flagship Port Arthur refinery. The project doubled its size to 603,000 barrels a day and surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N Baytown, Texas, plant as the country's largest.
A disastrous leak of caustic fluid in a new unit crippled the plant shortly after top executives from Shell and Aramco unveiled the expansion in May 2012, upping the cost that already had ballooned from $5 billion.
“That was a continuation of the bad blood,” said a person familiar with the relationship.
In February 2014, Motiva hired Dan Romasko, who had been the top operations executive at refiner Tesoro Corp TSO.N, to replace former top Shell trading executive Bob Pease as chief executive.
Romasko told Reuters in an interview a year ago that Motiva was “coming into its own” after the company announced plans to integrate the two Louisiana refineries.
Sources familiar with the relationship also said Aramco was said to be angry at Shell when refinery workers at the three Motiva plants went on strike in early 2015.
Shell led negotiations with the United Steelworkers union representing the workers, and the strike ended three weeks after the Motiva walkout.

AB InBev to sell more SAB assets as seeks EU deal approval,SAB,-0.079,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sabmiller-m-a-idUKKCN0XQ0SL,www.reuters.com,AB InBev to sell more SAB assets as seeks EU deal approval,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR plans to sell the eastern European assets of SABMiller SAB.L, which could fetch almost $8 billion, as it seeks European regulatory approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of its closest rival.
AB InBev has already lined up Japan's Asahi Group Holdings 2502.T to buy SABMiller's Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime brands for 2.55 billion euros ($2.90 billion), and said on Friday it had put up for sale SABMiller's business in Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.
AB InBev, maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, has barely any business in eastern Europe outside Russia and Ukraine, so analysts say the sale is more about preventing regulatory delays and exiting weak spots than ensuring market competition.
Beer consumption in eastern Europe has been on the decline, due to shrinking populations, weak economies and tighter regulation. That makes the region much less attractive than the growth markets of Africa and Latin America that are driving what will be the biggest deal in consumer goods history.
“The eastern European markets may have provided an unwelcome and unnecessary distraction, and valuation notwithstanding, we regard this asset sale as a net positive” for AB InBev, said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.
He estimates a sale could fetch $7.75 billion, based on a multiple of 11 times expected 2016 operating earnings of $705 million, with Carlsberg CARLb.CO the most likely buyer, though it might face antitrust constraints in Poland. 
Molson Coors TAP.N could have antitrust trouble buying the assets, following its purchase in 2013 of eastern Europe's StarBev from CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL]. Heineken HEIN.AS might also face hurdles from competition regulators.
But SAB’s business could be attractive to a private equity group or Asahi if it wanted further European expansion, analysts said.
AB InBev has notified the European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, which is set to deliver its verdict on the takeover of SAB by May 24.
If the Commission chose to open an in-depth investigation into the SAB deal, it would not receive clearance for up to 90 working days, a delay AB InBev may be keen to avoid.
AB InBev said in a statement the sale included a number of top brands in local markets, such as Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic and Dreher in Hungary. It said it expected considerable interest from potential buyers.
The sale is conditional on AB InBev concluding its purchase of SAB, expected in the second half of this year.

"Despite sales growth, UK's Tesco cautions recovery to be bumpy",Tesco,-0.077,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesco-results-idUSKCN0XA1T6,www.reuters.com,"Despite sales growth, UK's Tesco cautions recovery to be bumpy","LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco TSCO.L, Britain's biggest retailer, said on Wednesday its recovery was gaining pace but warned a supermarket price war meant profit growth would be hard to deliver this year.
The company, hammered by an accounting scandal and the rise of German discount chains, reported a first rise in underlying annual profit growth in four years and its first quarter of underlying UK sales growth for over three years. But it said there was much more work to do.
“We feel like we stabilized the business. We don’t feel that we’re in the crisis that, being candid, we were 16 months ago,” Chief Executive Dave Lewis told reporters.
“More customers are buying more things more often at Tesco,” he said, highlighting fourth quarter UK volume growth of 3.3 percent and a 2.8 percent rise in customer transactions.
However, Lewis warned that profit improvement “won’t be a smooth line” as Tesco cuts prices and invests in the quality of its products to help protect its leading position in Britain.
Shares in Tesco, which controls 28 percent of Britain’s grocery market, have risen 31 percent so far this year on recovery hopes but fell as much as 5 percent in morning trading.
Sales at British stores open over a year rose 0.9 percent in the 13 weeks to Feb. 27, the final quarter of its financial year, building on growth over its six-week Christmas trading period.
Tesco also reported a full year operating profit before one-off items of 944 million pounds ($1.3 billion), ahead of analysts’ expectations of 932 million pounds and the 940 million pounds it made in 2014-15.
That is a far cry from the trading profit of 3.97 billion pounds that Tesco generated in 2011-12 when it could seemingly do little wrong.
Sales, profit and asset values at Tesco have been hammered by changes to shopping habits and the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl, while the accounting scandal severely dented its reputation.
Tesco said price cuts in a “challenging, deflationary and uncertain market” would impact the pace of profit growth in the 2016-17 financial year, particularly in the first half.
Prior to Wednesday’s update, the consensus forecast for operating profit before one-off items in 2016-17 was 1.25 billion pounds.
“If we were to achieve that (consensus) and make all the investments we want to make, that is a significant achievement,” said Lewis.
Former Unilever ULVR.L executive Lewis has impressed investors with his decisive steps since replacing sacked predecessor Phil Clarke in September 2014.
He is trying to revive Tesco with a focus on lower prices, streamlined product ranges, better customer service and new simplified relationships with suppliers, the root cause of the accounting issues that are the subject of a criminal investigation by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office.
Lewis has also sold assets including Tesco’s South Korean business, and cut costs, including thousands of jobs, to reduce the firm’s debt burden. Tesco’s net debt now stands at 5.1 billion pounds, down 40 percent year-on-year.
Tesco’s better performance was broad based, with positive and improving underlying sales also achieved in Ireland, continental Europe and Asia and improved sales across all store formats and categories.
While analysts welcomed the return to UK sales growth, they point out that the discounters continue to open stores and take market share and competition with traditional rivals, Sainsbury's SBRY.L, Asda WMT.N and Morrisons MRW.L, remains intense.
They also note significant cost pressures from the UK minimum wage, business rates and rental costs and uncertainty regarding Britain’s EU referendum in June.
Analyst Clive Black at Shore Capital, who has a “hold” rating on Tesco shares, said Lewis deserved “considerable credit for steering this near retail ship wreck to calmer waters, where the group’s ‘engineers’, can and are now making progress.”

LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group said on Monday it had cut 930 jobs last month, as Britain’s biggest bank continues to reduce costs in an effort to improve shareholder returns.
However, Lloyds said it had also created 465 new roles, meaning a net reduction in headcount of 465.
The job cuts will mainly impact the bank’s commercial bank and chief information office, as well as its risk, community banking and insurance and wealth units.
“This process involved making difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way. All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager,” a Lloyds spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.
Lloyds said in its most recent annual report, released in February last year, that it had a total average headcount of 80,418 in 2016.
In recent years it has laid off thousands of workers and closed hundreds of branches in an effort to deliver dividends to shareholders in an environment of low interest rates and increased regulation, which have crimped bank profits.
The government sold its remaining shares in Lloyds last year, drawing a line under one of the largest bailouts from the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.
Lloyds will lay out a fresh three-year strategy expected to focus on digital initiatives and plans for growth, perhaps centred on its insurance or wealth offerings, when it announces its full-year results, which are due on Feb 21.
In the third quarter, Lloyds reported a jump in pre-tax profit, despite taking higher bad loan charges. (Reporting by Lawrence White and Emma Rumney; editing by David Evans and Alexander Smith)

Reuters was the first to report that AB InBev’s concessions to sell substantial assets would secure the EU green light for one of the largest corporate takeovers ever. [nL5N18H3QO]
AB InBev has already agreed to sell SABMiller’s Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime beer brands to Japan’s Asahi Group Holdings Ltd and to divest eastern European assets, three people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The takeover will give it a third of the global beer market, selling twice as much beer as its nearest rival Heineken.
The European Commission said Europeans bought around 125 billion euros ($139 billion) worth of beer every year so even a relatively small increase would cause considerable harm to consumers.
“It was therefore very important that AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller did not reduce competition on European beer markets,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The deal still needs to be approved by authorities in the United States and China. Australia and South Africa have already given their blessing.
The Belgium-based maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois wants to strengthen its presence in Latin America and Africa to offset weaker markets such as the United States where craft brews and cocktails are gaining popularity at the expense of beers.

"Berkshire discloses unit's ties to Iran, opens probe",Berkshire,-0.288,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-results-iran-idUSKCN0XX2DT,www.reuters.com,"Berkshire discloses unit's ties to Iran, opens probe","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said on Friday it recently learned that one of its foreign units made sales through a third-party distributor to customers in Iran, despite U.S. sanctions against that country.
In its quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said it alerted federal authorities including the Department of the Treasury on Friday about the transactions in question.
It said the customers “include or may include parties that meet the definition of the ‘Government of Iran.’”
The transactions took place from June 2013 to November 2015, and generated about $2,500 of profit on $45,000 of revenue, Berkshire said.
Berkshire did not identify the unit involved or when it learned there might be a problem, but said the unit has stopped shipments to the Iran parties and does not intend to resume them.
It also said it has hired outside lawyers to help it conduct an internal probe, and will cooperate with government agencies.
Berkshire has close to 90 operating units, mostly in the United States. It did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.
In August 2012, President Barack Obama signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, which makes U.S. companies liable for various activities related to Iran, including support for terrorism and human rights abuses, according to the U.S. Department of State.
The law also requires Berkshire and other companies that make periodic SEC filings to disclose various dealings with Iran.
Berkshire also disclosed first-quarter results on Friday.

Australia clears AB Inbev's $100 billion SABMiller buyout plan,AB InBrev,0.437,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sabmiller-m-a-abinbev-idUSKCN0XW00T,www.reuters.com,Australia clears AB Inbev's $100 billion SABMiller buyout plan,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s antitrust regulator on Thursday cleared beer giant Anheuser Busch Inbev SA’s planned $100 billion takeover of rival SABMiller Plc, saying the deal would not adversely affect the domestic market.
“The ACCC considers that the proposed acquisition is unlikely to result in higher beer prices for consumers,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.
The deal would not hurt competition in Australia because AB Inbev sold its beers in Australia only via distributors, “has only a limited direct company presence in Australia and does not brew beer here,” the ACCC said.
The green light from Australia removes another potential antitrust obstacle to the world’s No. 1 beer company’s deal to buy its nearest rival, one of the biggest corporate takeovers on record. AB Inbev has said it expects to complete the purchase by the end of 2016, but still has to secure antitrust clearance in Europe, where both it and its target are headquartered.
AB Inbev is the No. 2 beer supplier in Australia, behind Lion Nathan, owned by Japan’s Kirin Holdings Co Ltd.
The ACCC said AB Inbev has until now had its beers, which include Corona, distributed in Australia by Lion Nathan. It has agreed to distribute the product itself to ease regulatory concerns that the companies may coordinate market activity, the ACCC said.
The European Commission has said it will give its verdict on the deal on May 24. AB Inbev has already offered to sell SABMiller’s Grolsch and Peroni brands to address its potential concerns.
In April, AB Inbev agreed to delay any layoffs by five years and invest 1 billion rand ($67 million) to support South African farmers to secure regulatory approval for the deal in South Africa.

Royal Mail turnaround proving expensive in tough UK market,Royal Mail,-0.057,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-royal-mail-results-idUKKCN0YA0JG,www.reuters.com,Royal Mail turnaround proving expensive in tough UK market,"(Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mail Plc warned on Thursday it faced slightly higher than previously expected costs to modernise its operations in what it said was an extremely competitive domestic postal and parcel market.
Royal Mail’s prospects hinge on its ability to cut costs and modernise operations to gain a larger share of the parcels market in light of declining letter volumes.
“It’s an intensely competitive time in the UK and I don’t see that letting up anytime soon and I see the trends in that regards to be broadly the same this year as they were last year,” Chief Executive Moya Greene told Reuters.
It has also been hurt by the loss of some business from key customer Amazon, which recently started its own delivery network. Other competitors such as UK Mail have added extra capacity, threatening Royal Mail’s dominance at home.
The 500-year-old company, whose red post boxes decorated with the Royal Crest are a feature of landscapes across the UK, forecast costs associated with the transformation of its UK business of around 160 million pounds for the current financial year.
It previously forecast 120 million pounds to 140 million pounds per year until 2018.
Its shares fell as much as 5.8 percent and were down 3.8 percent at 488.8 pence by 1040 GMT, underperforming London’s blue chip FTSE 100 index.
Its shares have gained around 14 percent since the beginning of the year.
Analysts also pointed to uncertainties over the outcome of a review of the company by regulator Ofcom, which is looking into whether Royal Mail breached competition law, and negotiation talks over wages and its pension scheme.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo wrote the higher costs could drag down Royal Mail’s results for the year ending March 2017.
Helped by tight cost control, Royal Mail’s adjusted operating profit before transformational costs rose 5 percent to 742 million in the year ended March 27. Analysts on average had expected 727 million pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Including pensions accounting and other one-off items, however, profit fell 2 percent.

Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the Wall Street bank, a big donor to the defeated ‘Remain’ campaign had planned for either referendum outcome for many months, in a statement issued after Britain voted to quit the European Union on Friday.
“We respect the decision of the British electorate and have been focused on planning for either referendum outcome for many months,” Blankfein said in an emailed statement.
“Goldman Sachs has a long history of adapting to change, and we will work with relevant authorities as the terms of the exit become clear. Our primary focus, as always, remains serving our clients’ needs.”
Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said the outcome of the vote would not affect the bank’s new strategy of being a ‘transatlantic’ bank anchored in the UK and US. “The strategy we announced on 1 March, 2016 was not conditional on the UK remaining in the EU.”
Douglas Flint, Chairman of HSBC, Europe’s largest lender, said Friday marked “a new era for Britain and British business.”
“The work to establish fresh terms of trade with our European and global partners will be complex and time consuming. We will be working tirelessly in the coming weeks and months to help our customers adjust to and prepare for the new environment.”
Britain’s 2.2 million financial industry workers face years of uncertainty and the risk of thousands of job cuts after the country voted to quit the European Union, leaving question marks over London’s status as Europe’s premier financial centre.

Tesco is selling Kipa to Turkish rival Migros Ticaret MGROS.IS, while Giraffe is being sold to an unidentified buyer which already has restaurant assets in Britain, Sky reported, citing sources. 
Kipa said in May there had been confidential talks between Tesco and Migros but the parties had not been able to reach an agreement.
Tesco declined to comment. Migros could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours.
Sky reported in April that Tesco was planning to sell some of its businesses, including Giraffe, to focus on reviving its main grocery business.
Tesco, under Chief Executive Dave Lewis, has been seeking to cut debt and shed its loss-making businesses after its profits were battered by an accounting scandal and British market share losses to rivals.
When Lewis took the helm at Tesco in 2014, analysts had speculated the firm’s stake in Giraffe could be sold. In the first large divestment by Lewis, Tesco sold its biggest overseas unit Homeplus last year.

UPDATE 1-Berkshire applies to boost Wells Fargo stake above 10 pct,Wells Fargo,0.432,https://jp.reuters.com/article/berkshire-wellsfargo-idCNL1N19N1ZO,jp.reuters.com,Berkshire applies to boost Wells Fargo stake above 10 pct,"July 1 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has applied to increase its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co above 10 percent, the Federal Reserve said on its website on Friday.
Boosting the stake above 10 percent could mean increased federal scrutiny over the investment.
As of March 31, Berkshire was Wells Fargo’s largest investor, with a 9.45 percent stake, Reuters data show.
Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, and is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets.
Berkshire’s application was earlier reported by CNBC.
The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes.
In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit bank stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by James Dalgleish)

"UK housing market steadies after Brexit dip, Persimmon says",Perssimon,0.339,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-persimmon-results-idUKKCN0ZL0HI,www.reuters.com,"UK housing market steadies after Brexit dip, Persimmon says","(Reuters) - Britain's housing market has steadied after some deal cancellations immediately after the country voted to leave the European Union, housebuilder Persimmon PSN.L said on Tuesday. 
Chief Executive Jeff Fairburn said it was too early to judge the impact of the June 23 “Brexit” decision, but his company’s focus on lower priced deals involving first-time buyers and first-time movers made it well placed to cope with any turmoil.
“There is some uncertainty among people about what’s happened and that’s natural, but we’ve not seen that translate to any significant change in our trading,” he told Reuters.
Britain's top housebuilders, including Taylor Wimpey TW.L, Barratt BDEV.L and Berkeley BKGH.L as well as Persimmon, saw a combined 8 billion pounds wiped off their market value following the Brexit vote.
Although the stocks have seen some recovery since, they are still trading below their pre-referendum levels, with confidence rattled by the first suspension of a UK property fund since 2008, multiple analyst downgrades of the sector and government warnings over a possible fall in house prices.
At 0900 GMT, Persimmon shares were down 4.6 percent at 1,369 pence, despite the company posting a 12 percent rise in first-half revenue and saying it was on track to meet analysts’ consensus revenue and profit forecasts for the full fiscal year.
Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said investors were likely to “push the sell button first, and ask questions later” until a clearer picture of the housing market emerged.
Retirement home builder McCarthy & Stone MCS.L said last week uncertain market conditions could affect its ability to meet its full-year sales volume target, while London-focused estate agent Foxtons FOXT.L said its earnings could fall.
Analysts said Persimmon was in a good position to cope with any turbulence, with a strong land bank and forward orders of 1.36 billion pounds ($1.79 billion) as of June 30.
It also has a further 5.50 pounds per share to return to investors under a previously announced scheme running until 2021, which Fairburn said remained on track.
Liberum analyst Charlie Campbell wrote in a note that the company’s dividend yield should “at least” support its shares.
Persimmon said legal completions rose 6 percent to 7,238 units in the six months to June 30, adding it had “good levels” of sales in May and June.
When asked what the company would do if Brexit led to a recession, as some economists have warned, Fairburn said it could stop buying land and instead conserve cash.

EasyJet attracts more passengers in June but still lags Ryanair,Ryanair,0.259,https://www.reuters.com/article/easyjet-results-idINL6N0T80VQ20141118,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 3-EasyJet winter bookings rise as competition heats up,"* FY profit up 21.5 pct, in line with expectations
* Ordinary dividend per share up 35.5 pct to 45.4 pence
* Shares down 1 pct after strong recent gains (Adds CEO comments, details from call)
LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - British low-cost airline easyJet reported a small rise in winter bookings on Tuesday, shrugging off concerns about an increasingly competitive European travel market.
The company also posted a 21.5 percent rise in pretax profit to 581 million pounds ($909 million) for the year ended Sept. 30, in line with an upgraded forecast it made last month.
Cheap fares have helped easyJet and rival Ryanair win market share in Europe’s short-haul travel sector from traditional airlines such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, which have recently announced plans to expand their own budget services.
“EasyJet has proved that its profit upgrades earlier in the year were fully justified, whilst its outlook remains defiantly upbeat,” said Hargreaves Lansdown head of equities Richard Hunter.
EasyJet’s shares, however, fell 1 percent to 1,530 pence by 1035 GMT, after soaring 18 percent over the past three months.
“There’s nothing in there for the bulls to keep pushing the share price,” Panmure analyst Gert Zonneveld said.
EasyJet, Europe’s No. 2 low-cost carrier after Ryanair, said its strong position in main airports, where new slots are not readily available, would help it attract more customers.
Almost half of seats were now booked for winter, slightly ahead of last year, it said, adding it would grow capacity, measured in seats flown, by around 3.5 percent in the first half of its new financial year.
EasyJet is facing competition across the board. While Air France, for example, expands low-cost unit Transavia, Ryanair is moving into space traditionally occupied by easyJet -- improving its previously much criticised customer service and expanding into main airports used by business travellers.
That strategy and a surge in winter bookings helped Ryanair raise its profit forecast this month.
EasyJet said it would lift its ordinary dividend per share by 35.5 percent to 45.4 pence, in line with a proposal made earlier this year to reward shareholders with a higher proportion of profit.
Some analysts had suggested the company, which announced a special dividend in 2013 and 2011, could do the same this year.
Chief executive Carolyn McCall told reporters that was under review. “We’re not saying that we won’t do a special dividend, it’s just about the timing,” she said.
