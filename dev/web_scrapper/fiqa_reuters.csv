UPDATE 1-Dairy Crest loses a third of Morrisons milk contract,Morrisons,-0.161,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-dairy-crest-contract-idUKKBN0KT0IT20150120,www.reuters.com,Dairy Crest loses a third of Morrisons milk contract,"(Reuters) - Dairy Crest Group Plc DCG.L lost a third of its fresh milk supply contract with WM Morrison Supermarkets Plc MRW.L, Britain's No. 4 grocer, even as it exits its money-losing milk business.
Dairy Crest is in the midst of selling its dairies operations to a unit of German food group Müller as it battles low milk prices and shifts its focus to cheese and spreads.
“... If they sell the business, then it’s irrelevant for future profit. What’s happening now will be Müller’s problem,” analyst Nicola Mallard of Investec Securities told Reuters.
Dairy Crest, the owner of Cathedral City cheese and Country Life butter, said on Tuesday it secured a three-year extension from Morrisons to provide fresh milk, but supply would be reduced by about a third from March.
The company added that it did not expect the lower volumes to materially affect results for its fiscal year ending March 31.
Peel Hunt analyst Charles Hall said the lost business equalled about 70 million litres, or 10 percent, of Dairy Crest’s supply to retailers.
“The normal rule of thumb is that volume reduction in liquid milk impacts by (about) 5 pence per litre, which would equate to 3.5 million pounds impact on profits in a full year. This may be on the high side as the Morrisons’ contract was already highly competitive on price,” Hall wrote in a note.
Dairy farmers across the UK have been under pressure due to a glut in domestic milk supply, which has resulted in average UK farmgate milk price dropping every month since February 2014.
Dairy Crest cut prices by 1.2 pence per litre late December for farmers on its standard liquid and Davidstow contracts from Feb. 1. Scotland-based dairy cooperative First Milk also cut prices by 2.43 pence per litre earlier this month.
British lawmakers have also called for better protection for dairy farmers from the decline in milk prices.
Dairy Crest buys milk from around 1,100 dairy farmers and also delivers to supermarkets run by Waitrose, J. Sainsbury SBRY.L and Marks & Spencer MKS.L.
The Esher, Surrey-based company has been trying to increase profits by cutting distribution costs, improving its branding and selling property.
Dairy Crest shares were up marginally at 471.3 pence at 1023 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

UPDATE 1-Pearson expects to grow this year after solid end to 2014,Pearson,0.446,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-pearson-results-idUKKBN0KU0JJ20150121,www.reuters.com,Pearson expects to return to growth this year,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pearson PSON.L said it expected to return to earnings growth in 2015, after a solid performance its North American higher education unit helped bring an end to a turbulent two years of restructuring and profit downgrades.
The education and media group said for 2015 it expected adjusted earnings per share to come in between 75 and 80 pence, up from the 66 pence it expects for last year, in what would be the first rise since 2011.
The 66 pence figure for 2014 was at the top of a range Pearson had previously given of 62 to 67 pence, and was higher than a current consensus forecast of 64 pence per share.
Pearson's stock rose three percent to 1,273 pence at 0850 GMT, making the company the biggest gainer on Britain's bluechip index .FTSE.
“A solid update, both from the perspective of the full-year 2014 number and the early full-year 2015 guide,” Jefferies analysts said. “We would expect modest upgrades to follow.”
Having expanded rapidly, the 171-year-old company, a world leader in education, spent 2013 and 2014 restructuring to increase its focus on the faster growth areas of digital services and emerging markets to complement its core U.S. education division.
The process, which coincided with a raft of management changes, has taken its toll, with associated costs coming in higher than expected and the firm’s shares still to recover from an earnings downgrade at the beginning of 2014.
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said it had faced tough market conditions throughout 2014, due to pressures on budgets in North America and Britain, its two largest markets, and weaker demand for textbooks in South Africa.
“Despite continuing challenging market conditions, overall we had a good competitive performance in 2014,” Chief Executive John Fallon said in a trading statement.
“We enter 2015 a simpler, leaner, more cash generative business, well set for long-term growth and success, helping more people around the world make progress in their lives through learning.”
It benefited from strong performances in its online services, its English language learning business in China and by improving the profitability of the FT Group.
Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said while the 2015 guidance looked good, he noted that the figures were boosted by foreign exchange rates and a lower than expected tax rate.

"FDA approves NPS drug, in move validating Shire takeover deal",Shire,0.332,https://www.reuters.com/article/fda-nps-pharma-approval-idUKL1N0V21P820150124,www.reuters.com,"FDA approves NPS drug, in move validating Shire takeover deal","Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s drug Natpara to treat a rare hormone disorder, validating a bet by Shire Plc , which recently agreed to acquire NPS for $5.2 billion.
Natpara is designed to treat hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which the body’s parathyroid gland does not secrete enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). The hormone works with vitamin D to regulate body calcium.
Analysts expect the drug to generate peak annual sales of $542 million by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Shire, which makes Adderall and Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is seeking to expand its position in the field of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders and rare diseases.
About 180,000 people globally suffer from hypoparathyroidism, according to New Jersey-based NPS. In about 40 percent of cases, the condition cannot be controlled with the current treatment of high doses of calcium and vitamin D.
That uncontrolled population is the audience that NPS initially plans to target, which in the United States is about 20,000 patients, the company said.
Low levels of PTH can cause tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle spasms, fatigue, muscle aches, hair loss, dry skin, headaches, mood swings and memory problems.
Natpara is a bioengineered version of the hormone itself.
The condition can be caused by congenital disorders or surgery.
NPS also sells a drug for short-bowel syndrome, Gattex, which analysts on average expect to have peak sales of $526 million by 2019.
Data from a late-stage clinical trial of Natpara showed that 53 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to reduce their calcium and vitamin D supplements by 50 percent or more, compared with 2 percent of placebo-treated patients.
By the 24th week, 43 percent of patients treated with the drug were able to stop vitamin D therapy and required 500 mg a day or less of calcium, compared with only 5 percent of patients treated with placebo.
The drug was approved in Europe in 2006 to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at high risk for fractures, under the trade name Preotact.
But European regulators noted that studies in rats indicated an increased incidence of osteosarcoma with long-term use and said that until further clinical data became available treatment should not be continued beyond 24 months.
The FDA declined to approve the drug for osteoporosis.
NPS withdrew Preotact from the market last year. NPS has filed for approval of Natpara in Europe. (Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler)

Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs,Shire,0.235,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nps-m-a-shire-idUKKBN0KK0QE20150111,www.reuters.com,Shire to buy NPS for $5.2 billion to boost rare disease drugs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shire Plc has agreed to buy NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion in its biggest acquisition yet, as the Dublin-based drugmaker strengthens its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases.
The takeover continues the breakneck pace of deal-making in 2014 in the pharmaceuticals sector, as companies jockey for promising assets amid a wave of new drugs emerging from research laboratories.
Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told Reuters he would keep looking for more deals to grow the company into a biotech powerhouse.
Shire will pay $46.00 per NPS share, representing a premium of nearly 10 percent to NPS’ Friday close, the two companies said on Sunday.
The move will not come as a huge surprise, since Shire was first linked to NPS in May 2014. When plans for Shire to sell itself to AbbVie Inc fell apart in October, Shire said it could look again at earlier deal prospects and reports of Shire’s interest resurfaced in mid-December.
“This is about growth and rare diseases, and it fits hand in glove with our strategy and our franchise,” Ornskov said.
Shire expects the all-cash deal to add to its adjusted earnings from 2016 onward. It believes it can achieve cost savings of approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of consensus forecasts for NPS’ standalone future operating cost base from 2017.
The acquisition of New Jersey-based NPS will give Shire two significant new drugs. Gattex, a treatment for short-bowel syndrome, is already on the market, while Natpara, for hypoparathyroidism, is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA is slated to decide on the Natpara application by Jan. 24. “I am confident that Natpara will be approved on the 24th, however ... there is absolutely no guarantee,” said NPS CEO Francois Nader. “Given our interactions with the FDA, I believe it will be approved.”
Nader called Shire’s decision to conclude a deal before a decision “a calculated risk on their part,” that nevertheless “would provide the joint company the opportunity to deploy the most resources in supporting the launch.”
Consensus analyst forecasts for the two NPS medicines point to annual sales of $509 million and $534 million respectively by 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis, although Ornskov believes they may bring in more.
“Both of them have significant sales potential and some have mentioned the word ‘blockbuster’,” he said. The term blockbuster applies to a drug with sales of $1 billion or more.
“ALWAYS CONSIDERING NEXT DEAL”
Shire, which will tender NPS shares, has secured an $850 million bank loan which, together with cash reserves and an existing $2.1 billion five-year revolving credit facility, will pay for the deal.
Even though NPS is a record acquisition for Shire, Ornskov expects the deal, which could close in the first quarter of this year, to be paid off quickly.
“We are incredibly cash-generative and this will add to that, so this does not prevent us from considering further deals,” he said. “Shire is always considering the next deal.”
Shire’s coffers were boosted to the tune of more than $1.6 billion when it got a windfall break-up fee after AbbVie walked away from its $55 billion takeover bid.
Citigroup and Lazard acted as joint financial advisers to Shire, with Goldman Sachs and Leerink advising NPS.

* Floats 56.5% of business on London exchange
* Shares jump as much as 23% on market debut
* IPO bucks trend for recent lacklustre listings (Updates with details, share price rise)
By Clara Denina
LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Britain’s Trainline bucked a trend of lacklustre European initial public offerings (IPOs) on Friday, as the rail ticketing group’s shares jumped as much as 23% on its London market debut.
The British firm, which sells rail and coach tickets online, floated 56.5% of its business on the London Stock Exchange, valuing it at 1.68 billion pounds ($2.13 billion).
Trainline’s shares, which were priced at 350 pence, opened at 400 pence and quickly climbed to a high of 431 pence. They were trading up 20% at 420 pence by 0720 GMT.
Founded more than 20 years ago, Trainline sells tickets from 220 rail and coach carriers across 45 European and Asian countries on its website and mobile app, generating net ticket sales of 3.2 billion pounds in the fiscal year 2019.
The pricing at the top of Trainline’s targeted range marks a bright spot for London IPOs, which have seen a slow start to the year as uncertainty around Britain’s departure from the European Union has stirred market turbulence.
Despite an improvement in proceeds from European listings over the past two months, compared to a 10-year low of $292 million in the first quarter, recently-listed companies including Finablr and Watches of Switzerland are still trading below their flotation price.
Finablr had to slash its IPO price, blaming jittery markets and weak investor demand.
The company said it will use the proceeds of the IPO, in which fund manager Baillie Gifford has committed to invest 200 million pounds, to raise its profile and tap into growing demand for e-ticketed travel across Europe.
Trainline opted to push on with the IPO despite sources saying private equity firms had expressed interest in buying it.
A previously planned London IPO in 2015 was derailed when U.S. private equity fund KKR bought it for an undisclosed value that sources then put at more than 500 million pounds. ($1 = 0.7883 pounds) (Reporting by Clara Denina Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Alexander Smith)

Breakingviews: IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus,IAG,0.12,https://www.reuters.com/article/aer-lingus-group-ma-iag-breakingviews-idUSL1N0UR13P20150112,www.reuters.com,Breakingviews: IAG can pay more for Aer Lingus,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) can pay more than the 1.3 billion euros it is dangling before Irish rival Aer Lingus. The proposed price barely covers the value of the Dublin-based airline’s fleet, its slots at London Heathrow airport and its net cash. IAG cannot expect to get a decent operating business thrown in for free.
On one view, the improved proposal of 2.4 euros per share - 10 cents more than IAG’s first proposal in mid-December - appears good enough. It’s a 32 percent markup on the target’s share price on the day before the possibility of a bid became public, and an even higher premium to the average share price over the three months before.
But Aer Lingus’ recent market value is not the best benchmark for assessing the take-out price. It is affected by a dispute between main shareholder Ryanair and regulators who want the low-cost carrier to reduce its 29.9 percent stake to below 5 percent. The uncertainty over the when and how of Ryanair’s potential exit weighed on Aer Lingus’ stock. Moreover, the Irish government’s 25.1 percent stake means the free-float is thin and trading illiquid.
A higher premium can be justified on fundamentals. Aer Lingus’ fleet of Airbus aircraft have a book value of 660 million euros. The carrier holds 23 daily starting and landing rights at London Heathrow, British Airway’s main hub, which have an estimated market value of 250 million pounds (320 million euros), based on Breakingviews calculations.
Factor in about 400 million euros of net cash, and the carrier’s inherent value stands at about 1.4 billion euros. Its profitable and growing operations deserve a further markup. The Dublin-based airline boasts strong growth in transatlantic flights, has a lean cost base and eked out an average operating margin of 3.9 percent over the last decade. HSBC analysts expect the margin to rise to 6.8 percent by 2015.
For IAG, the deal is a good strategic fit and a hedge against further delays of Heathrow expansion. Aer Lingus’ board is showing some welcome resolve in rejecting the proposals so far. It can hold out for something between 2.5 euros and three euros a share.
- International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, said on Jan. 9 that Aer Lingus had rejected a revised all-cash takeover proposal that valued the Irish airline at 2.4 euros per share or 1.3 billion euros.
- “There can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming,” IAG said.
- IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, made a 2.3 euros-a-share proposal in December.
- Aer Lingus shares fell about 5 percent to 2.37 euros in early European trading on Jan. 12.

CRH's concrete bid for Holcim Lafarge assets,Holcim Lafarge,0.282,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lafarge-holcim-assets-idUSKBN0L51QF20150202,www.reuters.com,"Ireland's CRH to buy Lafarge, Holcim assets for $7.4 billion","DUBLIN (Reuters) - CRH has agreed to pay 6.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion) for assets from rivals Lafarge and Holcim, in a deal that will transform the Irish company into the world’s third-biggest building materials supplier.
Shares in CRH rose as much as 7 percent on Monday as investors welcomed a move that will expand the company’s global reach, making it the largest building supplier in central and eastern Europe and doubling its presence in emerging markets.
However, some analysts said it was paying a high price for assets Lafarge and Holcim have to sell to win regulatory approval for their planned merger, and that the deal was a big bet on construction markets in a faltering global economy.
“We think they’ve overpaid,” said Merrion Stockbrokers’ David Holohan, pointing to press reports the price for the assets rose 500 million euros in the last week of the auction.
“With two-thirds of the assets in Europe, the deal is going to be dependent on benefiting from any increase in construction activity in Europe,” he added, cutting his recommendation on CRH shares to “sell” from “hold”.
Data last week showed confidence in the euro zone’s construction sector declined in January amid fears of deflation and stagnating economies.
Lafarge and Holcim announced merger plans last year, hoping to cut costs, tackle overcapacity and weak demand by creating the world’s biggest cement maker. The firms said the sale to CRH put their tie-up on track to complete in the first half of 2015.
For CRH, the deal follows a breakneck expansion in the years before the financial crisis that CEO Albert Manifold brought to a halt just over a year ago by putting 2 billion euros -- or 20 percent of net assets -- up for sale.
Manifold said CRH had made some bad deals in the past by buying into market trends, but this time was different because the assets fitted well with CRH’s existing operations.
“This is just one that’s too good to turn down,” he told journalists, arguing the U.S. economy was starting to recover and the worst was behind for Europe.
“What this really does is it creates an opportunity for a whole new wave of acquisitions for the next decade.”
Shares in CRH, whose cement operations represented just 15 percent of earnings before Monday’s deal, were up 5.4 percent to 1,690 pence by 1220 GMT. Holcim’s shares rose 1.7 percent, while Lafarge’s were 0.5 percent higher.
CRH beat a consortium led by Blackstone for the assets, according to people familiar with the matter.
Analysts said the deal gave the assets an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of 8.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), or 7.7 times when adjusted for the savings CRH expects to achieve.
That compares with multiples of more than 10 times paid by Heidelberg in its $16 billion takeover of Hanson and in Cemex’s deal with Rinker, both around the height of the boom.
CRH said the assets, which will add 15,000 employees across 11 countries to its current workforce of 76,000, would boost underlying earnings by about 25 percent in the first full year of ownership if the deal completes by mid-2015.
Around 90 million euros of synergies -- net of implementation costs -- would also be achieved in the first three years post-acquisition, it added.
CRH will fund the purchase with 2 billion euros of cash, new debt and a 9.99 percent equity placing, representing 1.58 billion euros of issued share capital.
The company, which had a net debt of around 2.5 billion euros or 1.5 times earnings at the end of 2014, expects this to rise to 3.2 times earning on the back of the deal, before falling again thanks to its own disposal plan.

Ruling sets lower limit on potential fine for BP,BP,-0.261,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bp-trial-idUKKBN0KT11V20150121,www.reuters.com,BP asks for lower fine in penalty phase of Gulf spill trial,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - BP Plc, citing low oil prices, tried to whittle away at $13.7 billion (9 billion pounds) in potential fines under the Clean Water Act on Tuesday as the penalty phase started in its trial over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
BP said its fine should be modest as it took extensive steps to mitigate the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history and that the defendant named in the case, BP’s exploration and production unit, known as BPXP, cannot afford a big penalty.
“There has been no collapse of the ecosystem,” BP lawyer Mike Brock said in opening statements, contending that the Gulf has been more resilient than thought. Environmental groups say it could take decades for the Gulf to recover.
Brock said the penalties should take into account BPXP’s ability to pay, and not be tied to the balance sheet of its parent company.
He said a 60 percent drop in oil prices since June has slashed BPXP’s value to about $5.1 billion, down from $16 billion just months ago.
The government knows that “BPXP cannot afford a penalty in the range that they are asking for, and so that’s why they are saying look to the parent,” Brock said.
Steve O’Rourke, the government’s lawyer, said BPXP and BP are effectively the same company. He urged a fine of $11.7 to $13.7 billion.
“BP’s litigation position in this phase suggests that it still doesn’t understand the gravity of what’s happened here, they continue to focus on their own hardships rather than the hardships of the environment and the people,” O’Rourke said.
U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier asked during Brock’s opening statements whether the parties believed the penalties could be paid over a period of years given the current state of BPXP’s finances.
Brock said he was not sure, while O’Rourke said such precedent exists.
Clean Water Act rules say when assigning penalties the court must look at BP’s ability to pay, steps it took to clean up the spill, and its history of past violations.
In 2012, one person was killed and two were injured at a BP natural gas plant in Colorado. The Macondo blowout in 2010 killed 11 men on Transocean Ltd’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.
In 2005, 15 died in an explosion at BP’s Texas City refinery, which the company later sold. In 2006, oil spilled from a BP-operated pipeline in Alaska. And in 2005, BP’s Thunder Horse oil and gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico nearly sank because of a design flaw, postponing its startup by three years.
The Clean Water Act penalties would come on top of more than $42 billion the oil major has set aside for cleanup, compensation and fines. About 810,000 barrels were collected during cleanup.
Several billion dollars in potential fines were avoided on Thursday when Barbier put the size of the spill at 3.19 million barrels. That was well below the government’s estimate of 4.09 million barrels, which could have led to $17.6 billion in fines.
The first two phases of the trial, over the degree of negligence and the spill’s size, have concluded. The penalty phase is expected to last three weeks.
Under a “gross negligence” ruling Barbier issued in September, BP could be fined a statutory limit of $4,300 for each barrel spilled, though he has authority to set lower penalties.
BP has also filed motions saying the maximum fine per barrel is in fact just $3,000 because Congress never passed laws to adjust it for inflation.
A simple “negligence” ruling, which BP sought, caps the maximum fine at $1,100 per barrel.

By Sarah Young
LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - British aircraft parts supplier Meggitt Plc said it was on course to meet its guidance for the year after ironing out production problems in the United States, and it lifted its dividend as a sign of confidence in future growth.
The FTSE 100 company, which has a stock market value of about 4 billion pounds ($6.7 billion), reiterated guidance for mid-single digit organic or self-generated revenue growth this year, adding it was on course to deliver at the 6 to 7 percent level on average over the medium term.
The reassurance on 2014’s outlook, coming after a revenue downgrade last November, buoyed its shares which traded up 2.7 percent at 507.75 pence by 0903 GMT, making it one of Britain’s top blue chip risers. The stock had fallen in the previous session to its lowest since mid December.
“This is a bit of relief that the numbers are in line and that the guidance is intact,” Societe General analyst Zafar Khan said.
Meggitt’s stock had fallen 12 percent since Nov. 1, when it warned revenue would grow by a low single-digit percent amount, down from a previous forecast for mid-single digit growth. It blamed a supply issue with a raw material in the United States as it consolidated two factories, plus currency headwinds due to the strength of the pound against the dollar.
“They (the issues) are either sorted or there’s a plan that we’re working through and they’ll be sorted soon,” Chief Executive Stephen Young said in an interview on Tuesday.
Meggitt, which supplies flight displays and wheels to planemakers Airbus and Boeing, reported a 3 percent rise in 2013 underlying pretax profit to 377.8 million pounds, in line with forecasts, and said it would hike its full-year dividend 8 percent
“What it says is we’re confident with our 6 to 7 percent revenue growth forecast in the medium term,” Young said. The final dividend of 8.8p per share takes the yearly total to 12.75p.
Adverse currency movements could impact Meggitt’s profitability this year, however, Young warned, adding that he expected analysts to adjust their 2014 forecasts to account for those headwinds.
Growth this year would be driven by a recovery in the market for aircraft spares, Young predicted, noting customers had been destocking in recent years but the company was now seeing the beginning of restocking.
Meggitt’s energy business which accounts for about 10 percent of its total sales would also drive growth this year, Young forecast.
Demand from oil and gas customers for valves, sensors and heat exchange units produced by Meggitt was expected to rise 10 percent or more this year, Young said. ($1 = 0.5982 British Pounds) (Editing by James Davey and David Holmes)

Slump in Weir leads FTSE down from record high,Weir,-0.827,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-markets-stocks-ftse-idUKKBN0LT0TI20150225,www.reuters.com,Slump in Weir leads FTSE down from record high,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index retreated from the previous session’s record high on Wednesday, with engineer Weir Group leading the market lower after warning about a significant drop in its revenue in the current year.
Weir Group, which makes valves and pumps for the energy and mining industries, fell 8.7 percent to the bottom of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index after saying uncertainty in the oil and gas industry would significantly reduce its revenue despite cost-cutting.
“People have been talking about inevitable cutbacks in oil exploration for quite along time, and you would have thought that those companies with exposure to the sector would have already been on investor radar screens,” Jeremy Batstone-Carr, market analyst at Charles Stanley, said.
“Given that, it’s surprising that there’s been such a sharp reaction to Weir’s outlook statement.”
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed down 14.25 points, or 0.2 percent at 6,935.38 points after setting a new record high of 6,958.89 points on Tuesday. That surpassed its previous high of 6,950.60 set on Dec. 30, 1999.
Among other sharp movers, mid-cap AO World slumped 31.7 percent after the British online domestic appliances retailer cut its full-year earnings outlook as the boost around the company’s flotation faded.
On the positive side, Whitbread rose 2.7 percent after saying it expected to post full-year profit toward the top end of market forecasts, as strong demand at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee chain helped deliver a 5.8 percent rise in fourth-quarter underlying sales.
“Investors will have few complaints on a growth stock where the share price has risen 22 percent over the last year. Despite this rapid appreciation, the market remains committed to the story with the consensus still coming in as a comfortable buy,” Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said.
St James’s Place was also in demand, with its shares rising 4.3 percent to the top of the FTSE 100’s gainers list after it posted forecast-beating full-year cash profits, boosted by a rise in assets that underpinned a surprise increase in the firm’s final dividend.

LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group is paying its first dividend in more than six years after reporting a rise in profit and improvements in its capital strength, a milestone in the bank’s recovery after it was bailed out during the financial crisis.
The bank, which was rescued at a cost of 20 billion pounds ($31 billion) to British taxpayers, said it would pay a dividend of 0.75 pence for the 2014 financial year.
Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said Lloyds, which offered some of the highest dividends in Britain before the crisis of 2007-2009, intended to pay out at least half of its sustainable earnings in the medium term.
Lloyds reported an underlying profit of 7.8 billion pounds, up from 6.2 billion the year before and ahead of market expectations for a profit of 7.5 billion pounds.
The bank said its core Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its financial strength, rose by 250 basis points to 12.8 percent.
“Today’s results are another major milestone in the recovery of the British economy from the great recession and the bank bailouts,” said Britain’s finance minister George Osborne.
The government will receive a dividend of 130 million pounds. It had already raised nearly 8 billion pounds from the sale of shares in the bank, reducing its stake to below 24 percent.
Horta-Osorio said paying a dividend would help the government sell its remaining shares because the stock would now be bought by dividend-seeking funds. Such investors accounted for over a quarter of Lloyds’ shareholder base prior to its bailout.
“We believe that the dividend will be very important in enabling the government to reduce its stake at an even quicker pace,” he said.
Lloyds’ last payment to shareholders was an 11.4 pence per share dividend for the first half of 2008, paid out in October of that year.
Lloyds is further along the road to recovery than its bailed-out rival Royal Bank of Scotland, which on Thursday reported a hefty 2014 loss.
RBS’s turnaround has been hampered by investigations into past misconduct and a sale of the government’s 79 percent stake remains some way off.
Shares in the bank rose 0.8 percent to 79.2p by 1620 GMT.
Horta-Osorio has turned Lloyds around since becoming its chief executive in 2011, simplifying the business and slimming down to focus on lending to British households and businesses and meet tougher regulatory rules on capital.
But Labour lawmaker John Mann, who sits on parliament’s Treasury Select Committee criticised the bank for handing Horta-Osorio a pay package for 2014 worth 11.5 million pounds.
“It’s obscenely high. Why’s he getting so much and the taxpayer so little?,” Mann told Reuters.
Horta-Osorio also said he would accept shares worth about 7 million pounds awarded under a plan set out in 2012, but would not sell them until the government has sold more shares.
Lloyds said it paid staff 370 million pounds in bonuses for 2014, down 4 percent from 2013. Top managers were handed bonuses worth 30 million pounds.
“People will be rightly taken aback by the huge scale of the bonuses being paid,” said Labour lawmaker Cathy Jamieson, the party’s spokeswoman for financial affairs.
Meanwhile, the Treasury on Friday apologised for incorrectly stating in a letter that Britain’s financial regulator had granted Lloyds permission to buy back bonds issued to strengthen its capital in 2009 at face value. In fact, the regulator has yet to make a decision.
The issue is sensitive because the bonds, which currently trade at a premium to their issue price, are held by thousands of private retail investors. ($1 = 0.6479 pounds) (Additional reporting by Steve Slater; Editing by Sinead Cruise, Keith Weir and Susan Thomas)

"Glencore Cuts 2015 Budget, Plans To Divest From Lonmin",Lonmin,-0.314,https://www.reuters.com/article/glencore-restructuring-idCNL5N0VL12B20150211,www.reuters.com,"UPDATE 1-Glencore to divest Lonmin stake, cut expenditure to counter to weak prices","* To cut capex to $6.5 bln-$6.8 bln vs previously expected $7.9bln
* To divest 23.9 percent stake in Lonmin via share distribution (Adds details on share distribution and capex cut)
LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Miner and commodities trader Glencore plans to divest its stake in platinum producer Lonmin and to cut capital expenditure this year in response to market volatility, it said on Wednesday as it reported increased copper and coal output.
Like its peers, Glencore has been hit by a rout in prices of commodities such as copper, coal and oil. The company’s shares have fallen by more than 9 percent so far this year.
On Wednesday it said it would cut capital expenditure for this year to between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion from a previously expected $7.9 billion.
“Responding to the volatile market backdrop, we have comprehensively reviewed the planned level of sustaining and expansionary capex in 2015 ... with reduced spend from across the broad portfolio,” the company said.
Glencore also said it intends to divest its 23.9 percent stake in Lonmin, inherited through the acquisition of Xstrata in May 2013, in the first half this year. It proposes to do so through a distribution of its shares to Glencore shareholders.
The London-listed company said it sees a distribution of shares as a better option than a sale at this point. Platinum prices have been stubbornly low in the last year, weighing on the value of platinum assets.
Lonmin said in a separate statement that it “views Glencore’s proposal as a constructive way forward”. (Reporting by Silvia Antonioli; Editing by David Goodman and David Holmes)

By Tom Bergin and Ron Bousso
LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Big oil companies had a poor record of finding and producing oil and gas last year, according to figures out in the past week - and big cuts in spending in response to falling crude prices could undermine their plans to turn that around.
Four of the world’s six biggest oil firms by market value - Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, BP and ConocoPhillips - released provisional figures showing together they replaced only two-thirds of the hydrocarbons they extracted in 2014 with new reserves.
Combined, those four and industry leader Exxon Mobil posted an average drop in oil and gas production of 3.25 percent last year.
All predict their output will increase and new reserves will be added in coming years. But the 2014 results echo longer-term trends.
Over the past decade, the biggest Western oil companies have seen reserves growth stall, production drop 15 percent and profits fall by almost a fifth - even as oil prices almost doubled, a Reuters analysis of corporate filings shows.
Analysts and industry executives have blamed the sector’s anaemic performance in that period, in part, on companies’ approach to spending on new fields and infrastructure, tending to ramp it up when oil prices rise and cut when prices plummet, such as in the late 1990s and after the 2008 financial crisis.
The latest collapse has seen prices halve since June. In recent months, the biggest oil groups on both sides of the Atlantic have announced sharp cuts in capital expenditure (capex) out as far as 2017, as they seek to preserve cash to maintain dividends.
Investors have largely welcomed the focus on dividends. But some say the cuts could come back to bite the industry.
“Capex can’t be cut forever. Cuts in capex are only storing up problems for the sector down the road,” said Will Riley, fund manager with the Guinness Global Energy Fund, which holds shares in many of the big U.S. and European oil firms.
The ability of oil companies to replace reserves has not been as much of a concern for some executives and investors in recent years due to the shale oil boom.
But the high cost of extracting shale oil makes doing so profitably a challenge where prices are low - making traditional and less expensive reserves more relevant in a downturn.
BP and Chevron have announced around 13 percent cuts in capex for 2015, while ConocoPhillips last week upped its planned reductions in spending for 2015 to 33 percent. Shell and Exxon have not issued budget plans yet.
“We have to prioritise cash flow instead of growth for the time being,” Gerhard Roiss, chief executive of Vienna-based oil producer OMV AG, said last week as he announced an around 30 percent reduction in investment in new projects.
Oil executives play down worries about the sector’s fundamental health. They say lower production reflects an increased focus on returns, rather than output for its own sake, while falling reserves figures can be misleading.
“These (2014) reserve replacement numbers are a little lumpy ... I am not too alarmed about this year’s down(turn),” BP boss Bob Dudley told reporters this week.
However, even executives accept that excessive pruning of investments can cost them barrels and profits in the long term.
“Many of the things that you may do out of excessive prudence basically means that you lose them (the opportunities). They won’t come back anymore,” Shell CEO Ben van Buerden told investors last week.
Van Buerden said he would cut less than rivals to ensure he did not crimp Shell’s long-term prospects. Similarly, Exxon told investors on Monday that while it would monitor spending closely, it would not “forego any attractive opportunities”.
Nonetheless, Shell has shelved projects and put off $15 billion of spending it might have committed to over the next three years. Analysts at Jefferies predict Exxon will announce a 13 percent drop in capex when it presents its strategy plans in March.
Martijn Rats, head of oil companies research at Morgan Stanley in London, said in a research note this week that overly aggressive cuts could have long-term repercussions.
The expertise needed to develop new fields and infrastructure takes long periods to build up, he said. Hence, if companies lose this expertise, they may struggle to expand their portfolios when oil prices recover.
Executives say the risk is not only that companies may lose future growth opportunities but also that existing reserves may not be fully exploited.
Production from oil fields falls over time, because reservoir pressure drops as oil is extracted. Fields on average experience natural depletion rates of around 15 percent per year, industry executives say, but companies generally reduce this to 3-5 percent by sinking additional wells, injecting gas or by using other capital-intensive techniques.
Cutting capex will increase depletion rates, if past experience is an indicator.
“That is a growing risk for the industry. If you go back to the 2008 and 2009 period ... we saw an increase worldwide in decline rates for all companies, basically for the entire industry, increase by a percent or two. And that’s very significant,” Chevron CEO John Watson told investors last week.
Using data going back to the oil drop in the mid 1980s, analysts at Bernstein calculated the rise in depletion rates was 3 percentage points within two years after an oil price collapse began.
Across the industry, this could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil production each day.
Some investors and analysts say companies could yet use the downturn to help build long-term reserves and production.
Paul Mumford, fund manager with Cavendish Asset Management, said lower oil prices and a drop in drilling activity was leading to downward pressure on the prices firms which sell construction and drilling services to oil majors charge. This could encourage some companies to drill and build more, he said.
And Charles Whall, fund manager with Investec, said stronger companies should consider replacing reserves through acquisitions.
Morgan Stanley’s Rats added: “Sometimes, the best projects are done at the bottom of the cycle.”

Standard Life share price: Insurer buys advice firm Pearson Jones,Standard Life,0.364,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-standardlife-m-a-advice-idUKKBN0LA16820150206,www.reuters.com,Standard Life to offer financial advice with Pearson Jones buy,"LONDON (Reuters) - Insurer Standard Life has entered the UK financial advice business by buying British firm Pearson Jones from Skipton Building Society, responding to pension reforms that will boost demand.
Britain’s fourth-biggest insurer, with a market capitalisation of just under 10 billion pounds, said on Friday Pearson Jones had 1.1 billion pounds ($1.69 billion) in assets under advice. It did not disclose the purchase price.
Shock pension reforms announced last year, and due to come into effect in April, give retired people freedom over how to spend their pension pots and remove any obligation to buy an annuity, which gives an income for life.
Standard Life’s entry into financial advice was in response to “fundamental changes that are driving unprecedented demand for advice from customers”, it said in a statement.
Sales of annuities have already fallen at least 50 percent since the announcement of the reforms, and insurers and fund managers are looking at other ways to fill the gap.
“This was a very good move from Standard Life,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon.
“There is a lot of demand for advice, and Standard Life may have stolen a march on others by making this small acquisition.”
Analysts expect similar moves from other insurers, as government reforms drive the demand for more independent financial advice.
A move away from expensive final salary company pension schemes in Britain has also increased the number of employees paying into defined contribution schemes, which produce a retirement pension pot.
Standard Life said it was focusing on the “mass affluent”, typically considered as having up to 1 million pounds to invest for retirement.
Steve Murray, who has developed Standard Life’s UK advice and distribution strategy, would lead the financial advice business, it said.
Pearson Jones has 102 employees and focuses on the north of England. Standard Life said it planned to develop a nationwide advice business.
The deal is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2015, Standard Life said.
Standard Life’s shares rose 0.4 percent to 403 pence.

TRLPC - CRH backs Lafarge Holcim asset buy with 6.5 bln euro bridge loan,Lafarge Holcim,0.365,https://www.reuters.com/article/crh-loans-idCNL6N0VC1XT20150202,www.reuters.com,TRLPC-CRH backs Lafarge Holcim asset buy with 6.5 bln euro bridge loan,"LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Banks have lined up a 6.5 billion euro ($7.37 billion) bridge loan to back Irish building supplies group CRH’s 6.5 billion euro acquisition of assets that rivals Lafarge and Holcim needed to sell ahead of their planned merger, CRH announced.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and UBS are bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers on the senior unsecured bridge loan facility which comprises a 2 billion euro tranche A maturing December 31 2015; a 3.5 billion euro tranche B maturing June 30 2016; and a 1 billion euro tranche C maturing June 30 2018.
CRH can extend the maturity dates of tranche A and tranche B twice, each time by six months. The loan will be taken out by proceeds from assets sales and from new bonds.
In June 2014, CRH raised a 2.5 billion euro, five-year revolving credit facility.
CRH will also use 2 billion euros of cash on balance sheet to fund the acquisition, as well as an equity raising of around 1.5 billion euros.
CRH said it was buying assets mainly in Europe, Canada, Brazil and the Philippines. CRH will not keep sole control of all the assets it agreed to buy and is in talks with private equity firm KKR to partner on investing in the UK assets.
Bankers lined up just over 1 billion pounds ($1.50 billion) of debt financing to back private equity firm KKR’s investment in the UK assets, equating to around 5.5 times the UK asset’s EBITDA of approximately 170 million pounds.
CRH, with annual revenues of 18 billion euros in 2014, beat a consortium led by Blackstone. CRH was in a stronger position than the buyout firms because it could integrate the assets into its own business, and so offer a higher price, a source said.
In a conference call with reporters, the chief executives of the merging firms said the CRH deal price included the assumption by the Irish firm of about 1.3 billion euros of debt. CRH, which had a net debt of around 2.5 billion euros or 1.5 times earnings at the end of 2014, is also embarking on a disposal plan of its own.
Lafarge and Holcim announced merger plans last year, hoping to cut costs and tackle overcapacity and weak demand. Their new company will be the world’s biggest cement maker with $44 billion in annual sales.
Holcim and Lafarge initially received more than 60 tentative bids from industry and private equity firms for some or all of the assets. ($1 = 0.8814 euros) ($1 = 0.6656 pounds) (Editing by Christopher Mangham)

"Buffett's Berkshire builds Deere stake, dumps Exxon",Deere,0.316,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investments-funds-buffett-idUSKBN0LL28220150218,www.reuters.com,"Buffett's Berkshire builds Deere stake, dumps Exxon","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N on Tuesday disclosed a 5 percent stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co DE.N and said it shed a $3.74 billion investment in oil company Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N as oil prices plunged.
The changes were among several that Berkshire made in its common stock investments in the fourth quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the conglomerate’s domestic equity investments as of Dec. 31.
Berkshire began accumulating the bulk of its 17.1 million-share stake in Deere, worth $1.51 billion at year end, in the third quarter of 2014, but had not previously disclosed it. The SEC often lets Buffett quietly accumulate large stakes to deter copycats.
Deere shares rose 1.2 percent in after-market trading.
Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.
Deere declined to comment.
Berkshire’s decision to dispose of its entire 41 million-share stake in Exxon Mobil was unusual for Berkshire because the stake had been recently acquired, dating only to 2013.
Exxon shares have outperformed many peers in recent months, losing only about 15 percent of their value from June through January as oil prices slumped by more than half.
It is unclear why Buffett appeared to have soured on Exxon, or whether Berkshire made money on the investment.
Buffett “is of course a value investor, and the fact of the matter is that Exxon shares held up extremely well during the oil price meltdown,” said Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov in an interview.
Exxon Mobil declined to comment.
Berkshire also reported a new stake of 4.7 million shares in Rupert Murdoch's media company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O.
It further reported a new 8.4 million-share stake in Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.NQSR.TO, the parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Berkshire helped finance Burger King's purchase of Tim Hortons last year and got Restaurant Brands shares through the merger.
Berkshire also added to holdings in IBM Corp IBM.N, General Motors Co GM.N, Phillips 66 PSX.N, Suncor Energy Inc SU.TO and DirecTV DTV.O, among others, and shed stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips COP.N and pharmacy benefits management company Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O.
U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter.
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns more than 80 businesses ranging from Dairy Queen ice cream to Geico insurance to the BNSF railroad.

AstraZeneca's patent on asthma drug invalidated by US court,AstraZeneca,-0.656,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-astrazeneca-outlook-idUKKBN0LK01L20150216,www.reuters.com,AstraZeneca's patent on asthma drug invalidated by U.S. court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled late on Friday that AstraZeneca PLC's AZN.L patent on its Pulmicort Repsules treatment for asthma was invalid, opening up the market to a second, cheaper generic version.
Actavis Plc ACT.N said that the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruling prompted it to release a generic version of the lung drug. Another generic version of Pulmicort Respules from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.N, under a previous agreement with AstraZeneca, has been on the market for some time. 
Total branded and generic sales of Pulmicort over the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 were approximately $1.1 billion (714 million pounds), according to Actavis.
Paul Hudson, president of AstraZeneca’s U.S. operations, said that the company strongly disagreed with the court’s decision and that it is considering legal options, including an appeal.
In April 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey invalidated AstraZeneca’s patent on its Pulmicort treatment, but that ruling was reversed and remanded in October 2013 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
AstraZeneca said the decision would not have an impact on its 2015 guidance of a mid single-digits percent decline in sales revenue and a low single-digit percent gain in core earnings per share, assuming currency exchange rates remain constant.

New Credit Suisse boss faces stiff challenge in Asia,Credit Suisse,-0.181,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-creditsuisse-ceo-investmentbank-idUSKBN0M70UI20150312,www.reuters.com,New Credit Suisse boss faces stiff challenge in Asia,"HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Incoming Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam is expected to focus on private banking in Asia while aggressively cutting jobs at its investment bank, as he aims to repeat the success in the region of his old employer, Prudential.
Thiam could slash 3,000 jobs from Credit Suisse’s investment bank, or 15 percent of staff globally, and cut 150 billion Swiss francs ($149 billion) of assets from the bank’s fixed income, commodities and currencies business as part of that shift, analysts at JPMorgan said.
That may include Asia, where the former insurance executive will find a fiercely competitive landscape, dominated by cross-town rival UBS in the wealth management space and increasingly crowded with aggressive local players in investment banking.
“Prudential’s markets in Asia have been green-field, high-growth and not over-competitive,” said Keith Pogson, senior partner for Asia-Pacific financial services at consulting firm EY.
“But in the banking system low-cost local players are becoming stronger and stronger competitors. It’s a very different landscape.”
Thiam takes over after current CEO Brady Dougan leaves in June.
UBS - which shifted its focus to the region earlier - has nearly twice the assets under managements in Asia, though Credit Suisse is starting to make significant strides there.
Last year, Asia Pacific accounted for 63 percent of all net new wealth Credit Suisse attracted, bringing total wealth management assets managed in the region to 143.5 billion Swiss francs, confirming Asia as a main driver of growth.
By contrast, UBS’s wealth management division had 269 billion Swiss francs of invested assets in the region at the end of 2014.
“Asia as a subsegment, it’s been a very important area of growth for Credit Suisse. Even though margins tend to be lower, from a growth point of view, it’s still highly attractive,” said Jon Peace, a banking analyst at Nomura in London.
Credit Suisse’s investment banking division in Asia Pacific, is also lagging UBS, according to Thomson Reuters data. In advisory rankings Credit Suisse has fallen every year since 2010, from 4th place then to 15th last year and 17th in the year to date.
In equity capital markets rankings, where Swiss rival UBS has consistently been the top-ranked player in Asia since 2010, Credit Suisse ranked 6th in 2014 and 4th in 2013, the data show.
And in debt underwriting, Credit Suisse again ranked outside the top 10 advisors every year since 2010.
Thiam, who contrary to Dougan has no experience of investment banking, may be sufficiently detached from the business to make some tough choices, bankers say.
“Asia has been a fairly difficult area for European investment banks to make money. The investment bank is the main question over the new CEO strategy,” said Simon Adamson, European banking analyst at CreditSights.
“If they do decide to scale back, that would also include their Asia business.”

Sainsbury's says to outperform rivals in tough market,Sainsbury,0.536,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sainsbury-outlook-idUKKBN0MD0LD20150317,www.reuters.com,Sainsbury's says to outperform rivals in tough market,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Sainsbury’s expressed confidence in outperforming its supermarket peers and played down the threat posed by recovering rival Tesco on Tuesday, although it said no quick improvement in tough trading conditions was expected.
Sainsbury’s in common with rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, is grappling with food price deflation and an intensifying price war launched to counter discounters Aldi and Lidl.
They are also having to adapt as consumers shop more frequently, buy more online and shop locally rather than at out-of-town stores.
Sainsbury’s posted a fifth consecutive quarter of declining underlying sales but it said measures laid out in November’s strategic update were working, enabling it to combat the discounters’ threat and Tesco, whose turnaround under new boss Dave Lewis appears to be gathering pace.
Shares in Sainsbury’s, down 14 percent over the last year, were up 1.3 percent at 272 pence at 0952 GMT. Tesco shares were down 0.9 percent.
Sainsbury’s is cutting costs, dividends and new store openings to fund an extra 150 million pounds ($222 million) in lower prices. It is also investing in improving the quality of its products and expanding its non-food, online and convenience business.
“I’ve competed with Tesco my entire career. The important thing for us is to focus on doing what we do,” CEO Mike Coupe told reporters.
“We’re confident in the plan that we set out to execute. And the stuff that we’ve done so far seems to be pointing in the right direction.”
He noted that where the firm has cut prices it has seen average volume growth of more than 3 percent. Sales at convenience stores were up 14 percent, while online grocery order numbers and sales were up 14 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
However, some analysts remain unconvinced.
“It feels to us that it could be particularly negatively impacted by a sustained better out-turn from Tesco UK, making Coupe’s assertion that Sainsbury will outperform its peers all the more interesting,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
Sainsbury’s sales at stores open more than a year fell 1.9 percent, excluding fuel, in the 10 weeks to March 14, its fiscal fourth quarter. That was in line with company guidance and follows a third-quarter fall of 1.7 percent.
“We expect the market to remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Food deflation is likely to persist for the rest of this calendar year, and competitive pressures on price will continue,” Coupe said.

* UK’s biggest listing since Royal Mail, by market value
* UK’s largest-ever private equity-backed listing (Updates share price, adds comment, context, detail)
LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Shares in online car marketplace Auto Trader Group rose more than 16 percent on their debut in London on Thursday after Britain’s largest ever private equity-backed listing.
The flotation gave the company a market value of 2.35 billion pounds ($3.5 billion), making it also Britain’s biggest listing of any kind since the government sold shares in Royal Mail in late 2013.
The company, which started out in the 1970s as a weekly magazine, went fully digital in 2013 under private equity owner Apax Partners after magazine circulation slumped.
It operates Britain’s leading website for buying and selling new and used cars. The firm has focused its efforts on appealing to smartphone and tablet users, who run over 400,000 Auto Trader searches daily.
Auto Trader shares rose as much as 16.5 percent from the offer price of 235 pence to almost 274 pence, and at 1515 GMT were up 15 percent.
The company raised about 437 million pounds in the offer, while Apax reaped proceeds of 926 million pounds from a sale of 59 percent of the company.
Including an over-allotment option for up to 15 percent of shares, Apax would be left with a holding of around 25 percent. The size of the offering is larger than usual, and far above Britain’s listing requirements of 25 percent.
“They took the opportunity to reduce their overhang. They could have priced higher but they chose instead to do the bigger deal,” said a source close to the deal, referring to the unusually large proportion of shares that the fund is selling.
Apax acquired 49.9 percent of Auto Trader from the Guardian Media Group in 2007 in a deal that valued the business at 1.35 billion pounds. It subsequently bought the rest of the company in 2014 for 619 million pounds.
The listing follows an approach by U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman earlier this year with a potential 2 billion-pound takeover offer.
Analysts raised questions about next steps for the brand, which focuses chiefly on the UK and Ireland. It generates 250 million pounds of revenue a year and employs 830 people.
“It’s an online business that really does only one thing. Competitors such as eBay and Gumtree could impact that,” said Mike Butler, analyst at data provider Eagle Alpha, adding that Auto Trader is seen by some car dealerships as expensive.
“One option would be a bolt-on business in the UK, like an insurance arm, to build the brand here. A new territory is a bigger undertaking,” Butler said.
Money raised from IPOs is down 16 percent globally as of March 12 this year compared with the same period of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data, although the number of offerings is on a par.
Last year saw a spate of private equity-backed offerings, including British retailers Poundland and Pets at Home , as funds took advantage of surging stock markets to exit investments made before the crisis.

LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis said on Monday they had completed a series of asset swaps worth more than $20 billion that will reshape both drugmakers.
GSK is forming a consumer health joint venture with Novartis, while at the same time buying the Swiss company’s vaccines business and divesting its cancer drugs portfolio to Novartis.
The two companies originally announced the transactions in April 2014 to bolster their best businesses and exit weaker ones as the drugs industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and increased generic competition.
GSK, which now plans to return 4 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) to shareholders, said it would provide an in-depth view of its prospects at an investor meeting to be held when it reports first-quarter results on May 6.
The complex deals are more significant for GSK than for Novartis, reflecting the fact that the British group’s market value is less than half that of its Swiss rival.
After holding off from providing financial guidance for this year when it reported annual results last month, GSK said it would provide 2015 earnings guidance and “profile the medium and long-term shape and opportunities” of the group on May 6.
The transactions come at a critical time for the British drugmaker, which will see new chairman Philip Hampton take over on May 7.
Hampton, who chairs Royal Bank of Scotland, takes the reins following a tough year at GSK, which was hit by a record fine of nearly $500 million in China for bribing doctors and has disappointed investors with weak lung drug sales.
The poor performance resulted in the bonus paid to Chief Executive Andrew Witty for 2014 being cut by 51 percent.
GSK is receiving net after tax proceeds from the Novartis transactions of $7.8 billion, the majority of which will be distributed to shareholders through a so-called B share scheme.
For Novartis, the asset swaps will boost the company’s already substantial presence in oncology and are expected to lift core margins immediately.
The Swiss drugmaker now has a portfolio of 22 oncology and haematology medicines, with the GSK deal providing new therapies in melanoma, kidney and blood cancers.
Novartis is paying $16 billion for GSK’s cancer drugs, although up to $1.5 billion of this may have to be returned to Novartis if GSK’s melanoma drugs fail to meet expectations. GSK believes the necessary conditions will be satisfied, after recent positive clinical trial results.
On top of the transactions with GSK, Novartis also sold its animal health business to Eli Lilly.

"Aviva, Friends Life top forecasts ahead of 5.6 billion pound merger",Friends Life,0.39,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-aviva-results-idUKKBN0M10KM20150305,www.reuters.com,"Aviva, Friends Life top forecasts ahead of 5.6 billion pound merger","LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers Aviva Plc AV.L and Friends Life Group Plc FLG.L reported forecast-beating yearly profits on Thursday, lifting their shares to multi-year highs ahead of a 5.6 billion pound agreed merger due to complete next month.
Aviva is acquiring Friends Life as changes in the UK pensions market put pressure on life insurance companies, leading to a drop in their sales of income-bearing annuities.
The deal is expected to bring 225 million pounds in annual savings, Aviva reiterated on Thursday, and material capital savings, without giving further detail.
Aviva Chief Executive Mark Wilson, appointed two years ago from Asian rival AIA 1299.HK with the task of restructuring the company, told reporters: ""The proposed acquisition of Friends Life accelerates our turnaround and our ability to deliver our investment thesis.""
Aviva reported a 6 percent rise in operating profit to 2.17 billion pounds, a touch higher than forecasts of 2.15 billion in a company-supplied poll. Friends Life’s operating profit jumped 38 percent to 556 million, beating forecasts of 352 million in its company poll.
Aviva shares hit their highest since Sept 2008 and were trading at 557.5 pence at 0850 GMT, up 4.6 percent. Friends rose to April 2009 highs and were trading at 424p, also up 4.6 percent and an 8 percent premium to their close on Nov. 20, when the two announced merger plans.
“Aviva’s results represent a small beat compared to consensus on pretty much every key metric,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon in a client note, reiterating his “buy” recommendation.
Holders of Friends stock will receive 0.74 new Aviva shares for each Friends share. Investors, who vote on the merger on March 26, have said the deal makes sense as a way to cope with UK pension changes.
The reforms, to be implemented next month, allow retirees to use their pension pots as they choose, rather than forcing them to buy an income-bearing annuity.
Aviva said the value of new business for its UK annuity business fell 16 percent, as bulk annuity sales, or taking on the risk of company final-salary pensions, failed to outweigh a drop in individual annuity sales.
Friends also reported a 15 percent drop in annuity sales.
Aviva’s fund management arm is looking to an increase of up to 70 billion pounds in funds under management with the Friends acquisition, boosting total funds under management above 300 billion.
The company said a 16 percent rise in Aviva Investors’ operating profit “remains inadequate”. It signed a deal in January with Virtus Investment Partners in the United States, which Wilson said would help distribution.
In emerging markets, Wilson said Aviva was considering options for its Indian joint venture with Dabur Group following a rule change increasing foreign investment limits. Options could include selling the business, Wilson said.
Aviva will pay a final dividend of 12.25p per share, up 30 percent, making a total of 18.1p. Friends will pay a total 31.15p, subject to completion of the merger.

UK's FTSE has worst day so far in 2015 as BG and Prudential fall,Prudential,-0.651,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-markets-stocks-ftse/ftse-has-worst-day-so-far-in-2015-as-bg-and-pru-fall-idUKKBN0M60T720150310,www.reuters.com,FTSE has worst day so far in 2015 as BG and Pru fall,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top share index suffered its biggest decline so far this year on Tuesday, hit by drops in insurer Prudential PRU.L and energy stocks such as BG BG.L.
Prudential fell 3.1 percent as the loss of its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, to Credit Suisse CSGN.VX took the shine off a 14 percent rise in 2014 operating profits.
Energy stocks also slumped as oversupply and weak demand pushed Brent crude oil futures down. BG dropped 7.4 percent, Tullow Oil TLW.L 7 percent. [O/R]
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index .FTSE ended down 2.5 percent at 6,702.84 points. The FTSE has retreated from the record high of 6,974.26 points it reached on March 2. It remains up by 2 percent since the start of the year.
Engineer Weir Group WEIR.L fell 3.3 percent, reversing some recent gains. It had rallied nearly 12 percent since last Thursday on speculation that Weir, hurt by cutbacks in by oil firms, might attract interest from U.S. private equity firms.
On a brighter note, shares in financial services group Charles Stanley CAY.L -- which is not in the main FTSE 100 index -- rose 5.4 percent after the group said it might sell its Charles Stanley Securities arm.
Some investors have said uncertainty leading up to Britain’s general election in May may hinder the FTSE and prevent it from reaching record highs around 7,000 points.
Gerren O’Neill, senior trader at Thames Capital Markets, said the FTSE could drift lower in coming weeks but find support around 6,700 or 6,600 points.
“We continue to see further downside from here, but any pullback should be relatively short-lived,” he said.

Credit Suisse poaches Prudential's Thiam for Asian push,Credit Suisse,0.125,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-gp-ceo-dougan-idUKKBN0M601320150310,www.reuters.com,Credit Suisse poaches Prudential's Thiam for Asian push,"ZURICH/LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has swooped on Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam to lead the Swiss bank in a push to manage more of the wealth held by Asia’s fast growing club of multi-millionaires.
Thiam, a 52-year-old former Ivory Coast government minister, will replace American chief executive Brady Dougan, who has drawn fire for failing to reform the bank and scale back its risky investment banking business fast enough.
In a sign of Thiam’s standing with investors, news of his move added almost $3 billion to Credit Suisse’s market value on Tuesday and cut Prudential’s by nearly $2 billion.
As Prudential PRU.L boss - and the first black head of a FTSE 100 company - Thiam has built up a strong Asian track record, expanding the British-based insurer's sales in the region since 2009 and trebling its share price in the process.
While Thiam has never run a bank, shareholders and analysts regard his experience in dealing with financial regulators as a strength while lenders must implement a blitz of new rules imposed following the global financial crisis.
Dougan, 55, had been criticized for not paring back Credit Suisse's CSGN.VX investment bank enough after the introduction of global regulations forcing banks to hold more capital so that they could survive another crisis.
Chairman Urs Rohner said the bank would press on with its current strategy under Thiam, a multi-linguist whose private interests range from soccer to Russian literature.
“As you know, we have a strategy of growing the wealth management business,” Rohner said, adding that he wanted a more balanced allocation of the bank’s capital between the wealth management and the investment banking businesses. “It is not about a fundamental redirection,” he told a news conference.
Thiam was guarded on his plans. “Credit Suisse has been successful but I don’t know an organization that doesn’t need change,” he said. “There are things that need to be improved. I’m not in a position to go any further in the answer.”
Credit Suisse’s shares closed up 7.76 percent, adding $2.93 billion to its market value, while Prudential’s lost 3.1 percent, wiping $1.99 billion from its capitalization.
He was hailed as a star by the Swiss media, with tabloid Blick dubbing him the “Obama of Credit Suisse” whose appointment was a sign of Switzerland’s openness to the world.
Tages Anzeiger said Thiam might be much better suited to lead Credit Suisse than Dougan, an outsider in Switzerland whose departure was “long overdue”.
Under Dougan, Credit Suisse survived the crisis without resorting to a taxpayer-funded bailout. But he faced calls to quit last year when the bank reached a $2.5 billion settlement with U.S. authorities for helping Americans to evade taxes via secret bank accounts.
He will leave at the end of June after 25 years at the bank and eight as CEO, when he was one of the world’s highest-paid bankers with his salary topping 90 million Swiss francs ($91 million) in one year. More recently, he had embarked on several rounds of cost-cutting.
“Thiam has no banking experience but it could be that an outsider can make some of the decisions they were not able to make internally,” said one investor in Credit Suisse, who asked not to be named.
Thiam left Ivory Coast in his early 30s following a coup and joined consulting firm McKinsey & Co in Paris - making him now the third ex-McKinsey member on Credit Suisse’s 10-strong executive board. People who have worked with him said he has a sharp intellect and deals well with regulators and colleagues.
While at Prudential, Thiam failed in an attempt to take over Asian-focused insurer AIA 1299.HK in 2010 after a shareholder rebellion. Nevertheless, he successfully concentrated on Asia to drive profits.
His recruitment raises expectations that he will cut Credit Suisse's investment bank hard at last. Its European rivals such as UBS UBSG.VX have been faster to shrink this business and focus on other areas of strength.
“Thiam’s background in insurance and asset management suggests Credit Suisse’s focus is moving increasingly away from investment banking,” said a UK-based fund manager, who was reviewing his position after selling the bank’s shares on concerns about capital requirements.
Dougan's departure leaves JP Morgan's JPM.N Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs's GS.N Lloyd Blankfein as the only two global banking CEOs still in place since the 2008-09 crisis. 
The Credit Suisse board backed Dougan over the U.S. settlement, under which the bank pleaded guilty to criminal charges but kept its New York license. However, he was criticized by some politicians and media in Switzerland.
Thiam has the languages to help build bridges with Swiss politicians wary of bankers after having to bail out UBS. He addressed his first Credit Suisse news conference in German and French as well as English.
A fan of English football club Arsenal, he lists “The Brothers Karamazov” by 19th century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky as his favorite book and his top song is Tadieu Bone by Ismael Lo, a guitarist from Senegal, his father’s country.
Asked on a BBC radio show two years ago how he felt leading people, Thiam said: “It’s a bit like walking a tightrope because you feel all these expectations around you and it’s rarely comfortable. If you really believe in what it is you are trying to achieve it helps you go through a journey and walk without looking down.”
Prudential, Britain’s largest insurer by market value, confirmed Thiam’s departure as it reported a 14 percent rise in operating profit in 2014.
The firm said a successor has been identified and would be announced after the regulatory approval process. Thiam is expected to remain in place until after first quarter results are released in May. The insurance group declined to comment on media reports that its U.S. business head Mike Wells would get the job.

Randgold profit hit by poor gold price but dividend still increases,Rangold,-0.052,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-randgold-rsrcs-results-idUKKCN10F0VH,www.reuters.com,Strong gold price could hike Randgold dividend by year-end,"(Reuters) - Randgold Resources Ltd RRS.L could hike its dividend payout by the end of the year, it said on Thursday, as strong gold prices improve its cash position, although second-quarter profit was flat after its gold output fell short of forecasts.
Investor uncertainties including Britain's vote to leave the European Union spurred spot gold XAU= to a two-year high early in July.
At the end of its second quarter, Randgold’s net cash reached $273 million and cash reserves should rise to $500 million by the end of the year, Chief Executive Mark Bristow said.
“We don’t want to sit on a growing, lazy balance sheet... we have always said once we get to half a billion we will re-look at the pace of that dividend increase,” Bristow told Reuters on the sidelines of a results briefing.
The firm paid $52 million in dividends in the second quarter, flat on a year ago.
Randgold on Thursday reported flat second-quarter profit from mining, as lower production and a rise in costs offset higher gold prices.
Gold production during the quarter was hit by mechanical breakdowns at a mill in its Ivory Coast mine and technical problems at its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the company said.
But Bristow said the flagship Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali should ensure it met its full-year production target of 1.25-1.3 million ounces.
The firm's stock fell as much as 12 percent early on Thursday, but later recovered to trade around 4 percent lower, compared with a roughly 1 percent fall across the sector. .FTNMX1770
Analysts were cautious after Randgold’s output undershot forecasts.
“Given that the gold price is rising right now they could increase the dividend sooner than the market had expected. But whatever they lift the dividend has to be sustainable,” Investec mining analyst Hunter Hillcoat said.
Investec had forecast second quarter production of 295,000 ounces at cash costs of $653 per ounce. Randgold reported production of 281,494 at cash costs of $661/oz.
The company reported a $150.6 million profit from mining for the three months to June 30.

"FDA panel backs safety updates for AstraZeneca, Takeda drugs",AstraZeneca,0.143,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-onglyza-fda-idUSKBN0N51U920150414,www.reuters.com,"FDA panel backs safety updates for AstraZeneca, Takeda drugs","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc’s diabetes drug Onglyza and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s rival product Nesina should carry information about the risk of heart failure, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday.
Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The panel reviewed safety data on AstraZeneca’s Onglyza and Takeda’s Nesina. The drugs belong to a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors which also includes Merck & Co.’s Januvia. Januvia data from a trial known as TECOS will be presented at a scientific meeting in June.
The studies were requested by the FDA as part of a broader investigation into the safety of diabetes drugs. In December 2008, the agency issued guidance requiring companies to conduct studies to show the drugs did not increase cardiovascular risk.
The panel found that neither Onglyza nor Nesina increased the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack. But data showed a statistically significant increase in the risk of heart failure with Onglyza and an increased risk with Nesina that did not reach statistical significance.
Some panelists said that even though the heart failure risk seen with Nesina was modest, they suspect the risk will turn out to be a DPP-4 class effect and therefore worth including.
The panel did not recommend any restrictions on prescribing the drugs. AstraZeneca’s U.S. shares rose 3.2 percent. Takeda’s shares closed down 0.67 percent before the vote was announced. Merck’s shares rose 1.8 percent.
“Given the absence of a serious safety issue for either Onglyza or Takeda’s Nesina suggests that, barring an overtly negative signal in TECOS, growth of the DPP-4 class is likely to continue without a meaningful change in current prescribing trends,” Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.
A preliminary FDA review of Onglyza published on Friday found an increase in the rate of death from all causes. Panel members said they were moderately concerned about the signal but said their concern was muted by the fact that the causes of death were varied and lacked any common theme.
Onglyza, known also as saxagliptin, was approved in 2009. Nesina, or alogliptin, was approved in 2013. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.

Germanwings disaster will not affect image of budget air travel - easyJet,Germanwings,-0.046,https://www.reuters.com/article/easyjet-ceo/germanwings-disaster-will-not-affect-image-of-budget-air-travel-easyjet-idINKBN0MR1XR20150331,www.reuters.com,Germanwings disaster will not affect image of budget air travel - easyJet ,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The disaster at budget airline Germanwings which killed 150 people will not harm the image of low-cost air travel in Europe, easyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said on Tuesday.
Airlines across the world were left reeling after investigators said they believed the co-pilot of a Germanwings flight locked himself alone in the cockpit and deliberately steered it into a mountain, killing everyone on board.
Germanwings, founded in 2002 as a budget carrier, was acquired by full-service airline Lufthansa in 2009, and the parent company has expanded it into its main short-haul operator to battle competition from low-cost carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair.
McCall, in Amsterdam to open a new base for the airline, said the Germanwings crash was a matter for all airlines.
“This is not a budget airline issue. This is an airline issue. This is an industry thing,” she told Reuters in an interview.
EasyJet moved swiftly to change its cockpit policy as details emerged of what had caused the crash, requiring two crew members to be on the flightdeck at all times.
Under European regulations, pilots were permitted to leave the cockpit temporarily at certain times and under certain circumstances, leaving the other pilot alone. Since the crash, the EU has advised airlines to have two crew members on the flightdeck at all times.
“I think that every airline will be looking at everything they do in light of what’s happened,” McCall said.
After German prosecutors said Lubitz had hidden an illness from his employers, strict German laws on doctor-patient confidentiality have come under the spotlight.
Any changes to a pilot’s right to medical confidentiality would be an issue not just for the airline industry, but on a wider scale, McCall said.
“That’s an ethics issue. It’s something that the government will have to address. If they don’t do it in the Army, the Navy, there are equally sensitive areas that have the same levels of confidentiality. It would be a much bigger deal than just an airline thing.”
EasyJet, she added, has for years done more than is required by legislation to ensure the well-being of its pilots through its fatigue-reporting management system, which is used to keep a check on pilot tiredness.
Budget airlines have a reputation for pushing for the lowest pilot pay and the most flexible working arrangements to keep a lid on costs.
EasyJet, unlike some other carriers, said it employs staff directly on permanent contracts and aims to pay a median salary for the country where staff members are based, plus performance and company-related bonuses which can take pay higher.
But for McCall safety is about culture, not wages.
“I don’t think safety has anything to do with pay,” she said. “No one doubts that safety is the number one priority of the airline. I think that’s embedded in our culture.”
“Safety is entirely to do with the culture of an airline, with the professionalism of people that you employ, and that comes down to new recruits, how you recruit how you treat people and how the safety culture permeates the airline,” she said.

LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L) upgraded its annual net sales outlook on Friday thanks to higher client spending, but shares in the world's largest advertising group slid nearly 8% as the news failed to excite investors expecting stronger forecasts.

The results come as investors and analysts look to gauge how advertising will perform against a backdrop of high inflation and slowing global economic growth.

Shares in WPP fell 7.8% to 822.60 pence on the London Stock Exchange by 0845 GMT. The stock has climbed 17.2% over the past month, compared with a 6% advance for the FTSE 100 (.FTSE).

WPP now expects like-for-like net sales to grow 6%-7% in 2022, up from an already upgraded forecast of 5.5%-6.5%. It left its headline operating margin outlook unchanged.

Analysts and traders said WPP's results and outlook, while strong, failed to reflect the momentum seen in much more upbeat results from rival ad group Publicis last month.

""Market participants were unimpressed ... because they were somewhat expecting more for such a firm with strong prospects,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at Tradition.

WPP, owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies, also said the travel sector was also rebounding strongly, with 23% growth in the first half, although sales still remained below pre-pandemic levels.

Chief Executive Mark Read said he was not particularly worried about a forecast recession in Britain, pointing to client spending holding up across industries and markets. The UK accounts for 13% of WPP's overall business.

""We're yet to see any major impact on advertising spend,"" he said in an interview. ""We are in very close contact with our clients on spending patterns and their investments and consumer spending has held up around the world surprisingly well."""
LONDON MORNING BRIEFING: HSBC And Standard Chartered Shares Rise,Standard Chartered,0.556,https://www.reuters.com/article/hongkong-protests-hsbc-hldg-stanchart-idUKL4N2DH0RU,www.reuters.com,"HSBC, StanChart shares rise in Hong Kong after backing China security law","HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered rose on Thursday after the banks backed China's imposition of a national security law on the city, even as a pro-democracy and newly formed financial workers’ union criticized the move.
Some staff at the Asia-focussed British banks and analysts said HSBC and Standard Chartered’s stance on the law would help them protect their businesses in their single most important market of Hong Kong.
HSBC shares were up 1.6% at noon, after having risen as much as 2.8% earlier, and StanChart jumped 2.3%. The broader Hang Seng market index was down 0.1%.
In a break from their usual policy of political neutrality, both banks on Wednesday backed the national security law that has drawn global condemnation and revived anti-government demonstrations in the former British colony.
“Investors should welcome these statements,” said Hao Hong, Hong Kong-based head of research at brokerage BOCOM International. “It could get shitty if you are in the city and don’t support the law.”
The Global Times, which is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, said, citing a Chinese expert, that HSBC’s move should have come earlier, but can also be seen as “never too late”.
HSBC was caught up in Hong Kong’s months-long anti-government protests that started in 2019, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march at the start of this year.
Some protesters accused HSBC of being complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support protesters, accusations the bank has denied.
Some of HSBC’s corporate peers including Cathay Pacific Airways have faced retribution from Beijing for perceived support for the anti-government protesters.
“The reason for the statement is white terror, forced action to protect the bank’s business,” Wong, an HSBC staff in Hong Kong who declined to give his full name, told Reuters.
“When (these) two banks started to take stand, it will be no surprise that other banks will start to follow suit.”
But the Hong Kong Finance General Employee Union, formed in September to bring together the local financial professionals amid pro-democracy protests, has criticised the move.
“HSBC and Standard Chartered should clarify if they are betraying Hong Kong people while most of the governments from the western world are against this evil law and supporting Hong Kong people,” union Chairman Ka-Wing Kwok said.

Ninety-eight percent of BP shareholders supported the plan proposed by a group of investors and non-governmental organisations at its annual general meeting in London.
“This resolution is about disclosure, it’s not about setting targets,” said BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg at the event. BP did not specify what shape the disclosures will take.
A number of shareholders at the meeting, including a representative of the $300 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, said voting through the resolution was fundamental to them retaining BP stocks.
Some of BP’s top 20 shareholders including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Schroders and AXA Investment Managers had declared their support ahead of the vote.
“I suspect that these will be the first of many board-supported shareholder resolutions on this topic during the critical 2015-20 climate policy making window,” said Helen Wildsmith, head of ethical and responsible investment at CCLA, who lead the group’s engagement with BP.
Outside the meeting, protesters displayed banners and posters against BP’s involvement in Canada’s tar sands oil exploration.

Shell challenges Exxon dominance with 47 billion-pound bid for BG,Exxon,-0.196,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bg-group-m-a-shell-recommendation-idUKKBN0MZ0CU20150409,www.reuters.com,Shell challenges Exxon dominance with 47 billion-pound bid for BG,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell agreed to buy smaller rival BG Group for 47 billion pounds ($70 billion) in the first major energy industry merger in more than a decade, closing the gap on market leader U.S. Exxon Mobil after a plunge in prices.
Anglo-Dutch Shell will pay a mix of cash and shares that values each BG share at around 1,350 pence, the companies said. This is a hefty premium of around 52 percent to the 90-day trading average for BG, setting the bar high for any potential counter-bid by a company such as Exxon, which has said it would also use the downturn in oil markets to expand.
The third-biggest oil and gas deal ever by enterprise value will bring Shell assets in Brazil, East Africa, Australia, Kazakhstan and Egypt. BG has some of the world’s most ambitious projects in liquefied natural gas (LNG), where demand is growing as consumers turn away from more polluting fuels such as coal.
Shell is already the world’s leading LNG company and it would get BG’s capacity in LNG logistics - complex infrastructure that includes terminals, pipelines, specialised tankers, rigs, super coolers, regasification facilities and storage points.
“We are seeing a gasification of energy demand. Shell clearly recognise this,” said Richard Gorry, director at JBC Energy Asia. “That said, Shell is still taking a big gamble because if the price of oil and gas doesn’t go back up (in the next 24 months), I would imagine this might put them in a difficult position in terms of cash flow.”
Shell said on Wednesday the deal would boost its proven oil and gas reserves by 25 percent.
Stitched together by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden and BG Chairman Andrew Gould, the tie-up follows a halving of oil prices since last June, putting a premium on access to proven assets rather than costly exploration. Record low interest rates have made it easy to raise cheap funding for big deals.
“We have been scanning quite a few opportunities, with BG always being at the top of the list of the prospects to combine with,” Van Beurden told a conference call. “We have two very strong portfolios combining globally in deep water and integrated gas”.
Britain’s BG had a market capitalisation of $46 billion at Tuesday’s close, Shell was worth $202 billion and Exxon, the world’s largest energy company by market value, was worth $360 billion.
BG’s bonds traded up strongly on the deal and its shares closed up 27 percent at 1206 pence. Shell shares fell 5 percent to 1982.5 pence. They were the most traded stocks across Europe on Wednesday, with $1.6 billion of BG shares changing hands and $3 billion of Royal Dutch Shell shares.
BG stock has tumbled nearly 28 percent since mid-June, when the slump in global oil prices began. The agreed price is around 20 percent above BG’s share price of a year ago.
“In buying BG, Shell is making a bold strategic bet that oil prices will recover towards the $70-90 level in the medium term,” said Henderson Global Investors. Brent crude was trading below $57 a barrel on Wednesday.
Barclays bank said Shell would have to persuade its shareholders that it can control capital spending at the new company and show BG’s portfolio can deliver the promised growth options beyond Brazil, “something that, in our view, has been far from evident of late”.
One source close to the deal said a counterbid was unlikely. The source said a U.S. company such as Exxon may be doubly wary of getting into a takeover battle after the failure of drugmaker Pfizer’s attempted takeover of AstraZeneca last year.
The deal represents a windfall for Shell’s adviser Bank of America Merrill Lynch. BG’s advisers are Goldman Sachs and the smaller Robey Warshaw.
BAML has underwritten a 3.025-billion-pound bridge loan that will be syndicated to other banks and is expected to be taken out by a capital markets raising, according to the offer documents.
With BG, Shell would be the leading foreign oil company in Brazil. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies said they now expected Shell to surpass Exxon as the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Global LNG production was 246 million tonnes last year. The new Shell-BG group would have 18 percent of world output.
Van Beurden said the presence of two large players in Australia, Brazil and China and the European Union might require a detailed conversation with anti-trust authorities, but was unlikely to lead to forced asset sales.
The halving in crude prices has created an environment similar to the turn of the millennium, when large mergers reshaped the industry. Back then, BP acquired rivals Amoco and Arco, Exxon bought Mobil and Chevron merged with Texaco.
“A deal of this size would certainly be getting everyone interested in running the ruler over potential combinations in the natural resources sector,” said Paul Gait, an analyst at Bernstein Research.
But some industry watchers were reluctant to predict another flurry of mega-deals, saying many oil majors cannot afford to put stretched balance sheets under further pressure.
“If you’re looking to the next big deal, Exxon Mobil stands out as most likely to pull the trigger,” said Wood Mackenzie. “But don’t expect a wave of late ‘90s-style consolidation.”
Shell has long been seen as a potential buyer thanks to its healthy cash flow and relatively low oil price breakeven.
The deal, which should generate pretax synergies of around 2.5 billion pounds per year, will result in BG shareholders owning around 19 percent of the combined group.
Last year, BG Chairman Gould hired CEO Helge Lund from Norway’s Statoil to turn around the company. Gould said on Wednesday Lund would remain the CEO through the transition.
However, it was evident the deal was driven by Van Beurden, who took over as the CEO last year, and Gould, a veteran executive who previously ran oil services giant Schlumberger.
“I called Andrew up and we had a very good and constructive discussion about the idea and it very quickly seemed to make sense to both of us,” Van Beurden told a conference call. “What has happened in the last month, apart from it being a logical deal, it has also become a very compelling deal from a value perspective,”

Rolls-Royce Wins $9.2 Billion Order From Emirates Airline,Rolls-Royce,0.777,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-rolls-royce-order-emirates-airline-idUKKBN0N80QC20150417,www.reuters.com,Rolls-Royce wins $9.2 billion order from Emirates for A380 engines,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce has won a $9.2 billion (6.12 billion pounds) deal to supply engines for 50 A380 aircraft for Dubai’s Emirates airline [EMIRA.UL], the largest order in its history and giving it a boost after a torrid year of profit warnings.
Shares in the British company rose an initial 2 percent after Friday’s announcement, which Rolls-Royce said was the biggest order placed with a British company outside the defence sector.
It is the first time the Gulf carrier has ordered Rolls-Royce engines for its superjumbo fleet, the rest of which is powered by Engine Alliance, a joint venture of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.
Announcing the deal at a press conference attended by Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rishton and Emirates President Tim Clark, the companies said the aircraft in question would enter service from 2016.
Though a shift in engine supplier is rare, the deal had been flagged by Clark in March, when he said he was considering Rolls-Royce engines for the aircraft. The selection could raise hopes that Rolls will win more orders from Emirates.
Emirates, the leading buyer of the A380 jet with 140 orders, has said that if Airbus goes ahead with a revamp of its A380 superjumbo it would place a big order for that model.
Clark has said he expected any so-called A380neo to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines based on its Trent XWB engine.
“As far as the neo is concerned, we await the deliberations from Toulouse,” Clark told reporters on Friday, referring to Airbus headquarters.
Rolls-Royce was also awaiting Airbus’s decision on the A380 upgrade, the CEO said. “We have said that if they do, we will support that. We think that we can find a business case for it.”
The contract signed on Friday for the classic A380 includes a long-term “Totalcare” package, which means Rolls-Royce will also provide service and maintenance to Emirates.
Rolls-Royce is the world’s second-largest maker of aeroengines after GE, but its outlook has been hit by cancelled orders in other parts of its business, where it makes power systems for the oil and gas, marine and industrial sectors.
It warned in February that profits this year could fall by as much as 13 percent, on top of an 8 percent drop last year, saying the low oil price had increased uncertainty.
In its aerospace division, the company is in the throes of a cost-cutting programme, aiming to shed 2,600 jobs to try to improve profitability. Rishton said the new order would help secure jobs but the 2,600 planned cuts would still go ahead.

Tesco sales rise shows tentative recovery continues,Tesco,0.256,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-grocers-kantar-idUKKBN0MZ0O020150408,www.reuters.com,Tesco sales rise shows tentative recovery continues,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sales at Britain's biggest retailer Tesco TSCO.L edged higher over the last three months, industry data showed on Wednesday, adding to signs of a tentative recovery in the supermarket's fortunes under its new boss. 
Market share figures from researchers Kantar Worldpanel also showed discounter Aldi overtaking upmarket chain Waitrose to become Britain’s sixth-largest supermarket by sales.
The rise of Aldi and fellow discounter Lidl has been a major thorn in Tesco’s side in recent years.
Since joining in September, new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis has been fighting back by cutting prices, increasing product availability, cutting queues and improving stores.
Kantar Worldpanel said Tesco’s sales rose 0.3 percent in the 12 weeks to March 29.
That increase, which followed data last month showing Tesco’s strongest sales performance in 18 months, helped the supermarket to almost halt its market share decline. Its share was down only two tenths of a percentage point to 28.4 percent compared with last year.
Shares in Tesco are down 11 percent year-on-year, but are up a third so far this year on recovery hopes. The stock was down 1.3 pence to 250 pence at 1003 GMT, valuing the business at 20.5 billion pounds ($30.6 billion).
Lewis is also cutting costs and selling assets to mend Tesco’s finances and fight back from years of declining market share, debt-rating downgrades and an accounting scandal.
The firm reports 2014-15 results on April 22 when it is expected to post a third straight fall in annual profit.
Of Tesco's major rivals, Sainsbury's SBRY.L saw a sales increase of 0.2 percent in the three-month period, its first growth since August 2014.
However, Asda and Morrisons MRW.L recorded sales declines of 1.1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.
Asda, the British arm of U.S. group Wal-Mart WMT.N, in particular appears to have been affected by Tesco's improvement.
Aldi and Lidl’s sales rose 16.8 percent and 12.1 percent respectively, taking their market shares to 5.3 percent and 3.7 percent.
Aldi’s growth has been fuelled by over half a million new shoppers choosing to visit this year and average basket sizes increasing by 7 percent, Kantar said, though it added that sales growth for the discounters had slowed in recent months.
Aldi has an expansion plan which will see it double in size, reaching 1,000 stores by 2022.
Britain’s overall grocery market grew 1.0 percent over the period, Kantar said. Grocery inflation was down 2.0 percent, reflecting the impact of Aldi and Lidl and the market’s competitive response, as well as deflation in some major categories including vegetables, milk, eggs and bread.

"Whitbread Profit Up As Sales Continue To Rise, Looking For New CEO",Whitbread,0.385,https://www.reuters.com/article/whitbread-results-idUKL5N0VZ17F20150225,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Premier Inn owner Whitbread upbeat on profit as sales climb,"(Adds detail, comment)
LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Britain’s Whitbread expects to post full-year profit towards the top of market forecasts after strong demand at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee chain helped to deliver a 5.8 percent rise in like-for-like fourth-quarter sales.
The group, which also runs pubs such as Brewers Fayre, said on Wednesday that strong demand throughout the country had pushed like-for-like sales up 8.6 percent at Premier Inn, with group revenue per available room -- a key industry measure -- up 8.9 percent and occupancy for the year at a record high.
Same-store sales at UK Costa stores rose 6.9 percent in the 11 weeks to Feb. 12, Whitbread’s financial fourth quarter.
“Premier Inn and Costa continue to grow rapidly, winning UK market share, with Premier Inn also benefiting from the recovery in the UK regional hotel market,” Whitbread Chief Executive Andy Harrison said.
Analysts had forecast Whitbread’s 2014/15 pretax profit in a range of 437 million pounds ($679 million) to 495 million pounds, with the average estimate at 472 million pounds, according to Reuters data.
Shares in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which have risen 22 percent over the past year, gained 2 percent to 52.05 pounds in early trade on Wednesday.
Whitbread has grown rapidly in recent years on demand from cost-conscious customers for affordable hotels and a trend for takeaway coffee, with an improving British economy now providing added momentum.
To capitalise, the group wants to expand Premier Inn to 75,000 rooms by 2018, up from about 56,700, and to double Costa’s sales to 2 billion pounds through expansion at home and abroad, particularly in China.
Whitbread said that 5,500 hotel rooms would be added this financial year, against 4,500 in 2014/15, with net new Costa stores rising from 230 to 250 worldwide.
The company said that capital investment would rise to 700 million pounds, from 575 million pounds in 2014/15, as it strengthens its freehold hotel pipeline, particularly in London.
Some analysts expect Whitbread to demerge Costa, which has about 1,750 British stores and 1,100 more overseas and has been valued at around 3 billion pounds. However, Harrison told Reuters that the group remains focused on expanding the chain.
“Costa will continue to create very substantial shareholder value through profitable growth, and that’s what we are concentrating on,” he said. ($1 = 0.6440 pounds)

Glencore blames rivals for creating metals glut,Glencore,-0.331,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-glencore-agm-idUKKBN0NS1BJ20150507,www.reuters.com,Glencore blames rivals for creating metals glut,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of global mining and trading company Glencore GLEN.L said rivals were to blame for an oversupply of metals which depressed its share price.
Despite a partial recovery in the last few months, Glencore’s shares are down about 6 percent from a year ago, under pressure from a rout in prices for most of the commodities it produces and trades.
“Unfortunately our competitors in the world have produced more supply than demand and commodity prices are down for that reason,” Glasenberg said at the company’s annual meeting.
“I am doing my level best to convince my competitors we should understand the words demand and supply,” he added in response to a question from an investor about the share price.
Glasenberg has criticised rivals such as Rio Tinto RIO.L and BHP Billiton BLT.LBHP.AX at various times, blaming them for oversupplying the market, particularly in iron ore, a commodity Glencore has little exposure to.
Glasenberg said he was optimistic about the outlook for its key products: copper, nickel and zinc.
Coal, another main commodity for Glencore, also “looks good going forward”, Glasenberg said, as Indonesia exports taper off with the country consuming more coal domestically.
Coal prices have been battered by a large supply overhang in the last couple of years.
Glasenberg has said unlike his rivals he would not aim to “cannibalise” his own market by adding to the glut.
The world’s largest exporter of thermal coal said in March that its 2015 coal output was expected to fall by around 6 percent on the year after production cuts at some of its coal operations.
But London-listed Glencore’s coal output rose by 4 percent in the first quarter this year from the same period a year ago.
In January the company said it could shut down production destined for export from its Optimum Coal Mines in South Africa, which would put 1,070 jobs at risk.
In reply to a shareholder who asked the company to prevent such a blow to the country, South Africa-born Glasenberg said if the company goes ahead with the Optimum closure it would expand capacity at another lower cost South African mine.
“So the net net effect should be the same but (would) just provide more benefit for shareholders, more benefit for the country, larger taxes being paid,” he said.

* Cash return was planned after Novartis asset swap deal
* GSK to showcase reshaped business at May 6 investor day
LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline may ditch a plan to return 4 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) to investors, some analysts believe, as the drugmaker prepares to set out its vision for the reshaped group and a new chairman takes the helm.
Instead, Britain’s biggest drugmaker could use cash flowing in from its far-reaching asset swap deal with Novartis to support its dividend, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs and Berenberg Bank.
GSK said last year it intended to return 4 billion pounds to shareholders in 2015 through a so-called B share scheme, following its $20 billion-plus transaction with Novartis, which was finalised two months ago.
But with the drugmaker’s dividend under pressure following several years of stagnant growth, some believe it might make more sense to cancel the programme.
“Momentum behind this capital return seems to have stalled,” Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note on Friday. “With the dividend commitment under pressure, we think there is now a credible possibility the company will cancel the capital return in favour of supporting the dividend.”
Scrapping the cash return could cut earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 3-4 percent. But this would be offset by renewed confidence in the dividend, which offers a fat yield of 5 percent.
While the company has promised that this year’s dividend will be held at 2014’s level of 80 pence a share, there are concerns about the outlook for 2016.
“Importantly, in the context of dividend yield, we believe that if GSK were to sacrifice the B share scheme, greater certainty on the dividend in 2016 and beyond might be well received by investors,” Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.
A GSK spokesman said it was company policy never to comment on market speculation.
The debate comes as Chief Executive Andrew Witty prepares to detail prospects for the new-look GSK at an investor day on May 6, when it will also announce first-quarter results. The company’s annual meeting a day later will see new chairman Philip Hampton take over.
GSK has sold its cancer drugs portfolio to Novartis, while at the same time boosting its consumer health business through a joint venture with the Swiss company and buying Novartis’s vaccines.
This reduces GSK’s reliance on risky drug development and increases its exposure to more stable consumer and vaccines operations, both of which have long-lasting products but, in the case of consumer health, lower margins.

* Appetite for equities knocked by global bond sell-off
* Airline easyJet sees disappointing Q3 outlook
EDINBURGH, May 12 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index fell sharply on Monday, led lower by a slump in easyJet, with the appetite for equities knocked by a global bond sell-off, ensuring that optimism after a decisive British election result was short-lived.
Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 64.64 points, or 0.9 percent, at 6,965.21, but remained up 1 percent since the start of Friday, when markets rallied after an unexpected Conservative majority in the election.
Although the market remains well clear of recent lows, focus has switched away from domestic politics, with markets across Europe all more than a percent lower as a global bond sell-off resumed.
The sell-off has surprised investors and puzzled analysts since the end of April. While analysts have said the sell-off was partly triggered by an uptick in inflation expectations, yields continue to rise despite oil prices dipping and renewed worries over Greece.
“This is having a major impact on the other asset classes, and the volatility spills over into equity futures ... Risk managers are looking at decreasing their levels of risk, given the moves,” Ioan Smith, managing director of KCG Europe, said.
“When you’ve got this sort of volatility in something like the Bund, which is considered a safe haven asset, you have to question the functioning of the market more broadly.”
The sell-off on the FTSE was broad based, with 92 out of 100 stocks in negative territory.
Leading the fallers was easyJet after the low-cost airline struck a cautious tone over outlook, dropping 7.8 percent.
The airline warned it would take a hit from air traffic strikes in April, and said that revenue per seat would fall in the third quarter despite turning a profit in the weaker winter seasons for the first time.
“There are pluses and minuses in the statement but we are trimming our full year PBT forecast from 691 million pounds to 660 million pounds, primarily to reflect 25 million pounds of disruption costs in April (French air traffic control),” analysts at Numis write in a note.
“We would expect the share to give up a little of its recent performance today, but strategically we believe that easyJet continues to be well placed for growth.”

Imperial Tobacco Adds Quarterly Dividends After Profit Rose,Imperial Tobacco,0.336,https://www.reuters.com/article/imperial-tobacco-results-idUSL6N0SU11L20141104,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 2-Imperial Tobacco pledges 10 percent dividend increase,"* Raised dividend by 10 pct, pledges same or better in 2015
* Revenue, profit miss analysts’ average estimates
* Shares up 3 pct (Recasts with analyst, background, byline)
LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Imperial Tobacco Group said it would raise its dividend by at least 10 percent in the next year, signalling confidence that cost cuts will help it to cope with weak consumer spending and higher taxes that weighed on its annual profit.
Like all tobacco companies, Imperial has been grappling with declining sales in a number of markets, as more people cut back or quit smoking. In addition, weak economies and government tax increases are making cigarettes less affordable, leading to lower-priced brands gaining in popularity.
Imperial, whose brands include Davidoff and Gauloises, has tackled this by cutting costs, including closing factories, resulting in more than 60 million pounds ($95.95 million) of savings in the year to Sept. 30. It said it was on track to save 300 million pounds each year by 2018.
The company also recently floated a portion of its logistics business, Logista, on the Spanish stock exchange, raising 395 million pounds which it used to pay down debt. At the end of its financial year, its net down was down 11 percent to 8.1 billion pounds.
Imperial Tobacco said it expected to raise its dividend by at least 10 percent for its new financial year (2014/15), following a 10 percent increase for the year to September 30.
RBC Capital Markets analysts said the dividend goal was “a signal of Imperial’s confidence in its debt trajectory.”
The company’s shares were up 3 percent at 2,747 pence at 1116 GMT on Tuesday, the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index , illustrating the attraction of large tobacco firms and their generous dividends in times of choppy markets.
Shares of larger rival British American Tobacco were up about 1.3 percent, while the FTSE 100 index was about flat.
The world’s fourth-largest international tobacco company said net revenue in its tobacco business fell 6 percent to 6.58 billion pounds in the fiscal year. As of Oct. 10, analysts on average were expecting 6.97 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Excluding foreign exchange rates and the impact of a stock optimisation programme that intentionally reduced inventories in several markets, underlying revenue rose 2 percent.
Volume, which measures the amount of tobacco sold, fell 4 percent, which the company said was in line with that of its overall markets.
Adjusted earnings per share fell 3 percent to 203.4 pence on a reported basis in the year, also missing analysts’ estimates of 214.2 pence per share, according to the consensus.
“Trading conditions remain tough in many territories but the actions we’ve taken to enhance the quality and sustainability of the business have put us in a stronger position to drive growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders,” Chief Executive Alison Cooper said.
The company is set to acquire the Maverick and Salem brands, and blu, the leading U.S. e-cigarette brand, for $7.1 billion to ease passage of Reynolds American’s $27.4 billion purchase of Lorillard. (1 US dollar = 0.6254 British pound) (Editing by Mark Potter and Jane Merriman)

SABMiller buys Meantime to quench thirst for craft beer,SABMiller,0.296,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-meantime-m-a-sab-idUSKBN0O016320150515,www.reuters.com,SABMiller buys Meantime to quench thirst for craft beer,"LONDON (Reuters) - SABMiller SAB.L is buying Britain's Meantime Brewing Company, swallowing up one of the pioneers of the country's craft brewing movement to give the owner of big brands such as Peroni and Grolsch exposure to a fast-growing part of the drinks market.
A surge in demand for craft beers in recent years has stolen market share from the world's two biggest brewers, SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR, as drinkers seek new tastes and support niche, local suppliers.
Sales volumes of Meantime’s beers including London Pale Ale and London Lager soared 58 percent in 2014, compared with a 1 percent rise in Britain’s beer market as a whole. The more richly flavored craft beer also sells at a premium to standard lager, another draw for SABMiller.
However, some supporters of craft beer say brands such as Meantime, which was founded in 1999 with the backing of a group of friends in a former tramshed in Greenwich, south London, risk losing their appeal if they sell out to a global brewer.
“I probably won’t be drinking Meantime anymore,” said Jeff Rosenmeier, founder of the Lovibonds craft brewery in Henley-on-Thames, southern England, though he conceded most drinkers wouldn’t notice and only “beer geeks” would turn away from it.
“Lame, lame, lame,” wrote one craft beer fan on Twitter, while another said “Goodbye to a indie brewery success story”.
Meantime chief executive Nick Miller, who joined from SABMiller in 2011, rejected the criticism.
“Why would Meantime suddenly not become a craft beer just because it’s got a different set of shareholders?” he asked on a call with reporters.
“Are you telling me that shareholders determine whether you’re craft or not? Surely it’s about the liquid, the beers that you produce, and the passion that you have for producing beer?”
Meantime’s founder Alastair Hook, its brew master, and Miller will continue to be part of Meantime following completion of the deal, expected in early June.
SABMiller said it aimed to grow sales of Meantime’s beers across Britain and use its distribution networks to export it to other markets in Europe.
AB InBev bought Goose Island, a U.S. craft beer brand, in 2011, and in the past year acquired craft names Blue Point and 10 Barrels, prompting a backlash on social media, with the three brands featuring on the website “Craftbeerblacklist”.
SABMiller’s U.S. joint venture with Molson Coors, MillerCoors, already sells Blue Moon in that country, another beer that plays in the craft beer category, although it has also faced some criticism.
Despite that, analysts welcomed SABMiller’s expansion into a fast-growing market.
“The variety of styles added to SAB’s extensive local and heritage beer menu should serve it well,” Accendo Market’s Mike van Dulken said.
SABMiller shares were up 1.2 percent at 3,644 pence at 1120 GMT (7.20 a.m. ET), within a UK blue-chip index up 0.3 percent .FTSE.
The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but will be small in the context of SABMiller’s market capitalization of 58 billion pounds ($91 billion). SABMiller sold 245 million hectolitres of lager in 2014, compared with Meantime’s annual capacity for production of 120,000 hectolitres.

* Kingfisher and Sports Direct reports bolster retail
* Miners weaker as Goldman sees cartel as unlikely
LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index edged higher on Thursday, led by retailers after Sports Direct raised its full-year earnings and profit outlook and Kingfisher reported a rise in retail profit.
Britain’s biggest sporting goods retailer Sports Direct rose 4.6 percent, the top gainer in the FTSE 100 index , after raising its outlook, citing lower interest charges and what it described as a prudent depreciation policy.
Europe’s biggest home retail company Kingfisher followed, up 3.3 percent after reporting a rise in first-quarter retail profit, helped by a strong performance at Screwfix which lifted sales at the group’s British arm.
“UK wage growth has started to pick up and shopping has been boosted by low inflation. Consumers now have more money in their pockets to spend on general merchandise,” said Edmund Shing, global equity fund manager at BCS Asset Management.
Adding to the bullish picture, British consumer confidence surged this month to its highest level in a year as more households expected their finances to improve in the coming 12 months, a survey showed on Thursday.
The FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent at 7,046.37 points by 1050 GMT. Gains were capped by weaker miners, which fell 0.4 percent.
The sector is down 9 percent since May 5 as copper prices have dropped to a four-week low. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said overnight that major iron ore miners were unlikely to create a cartel and agree on output cuts to shore up prices.
“Goldman Sachs said that they don’t see a cartel in the sector ... so in the grand scheme of things, metal prices are weak, (and) without a cartel look set to remain weak,” said David Madden, market analyst at IG.
“Demand for the underlying minerals looks weak, and the supply side looks set to keep the pressure up on these stocks as well.”
Product-testing firm Intertek Group was the blue-chip index’s top loser, falling 1.5 percent to 2,538 pence, after Deutsche Bank cut its stance to “hold” from “buy” and lowered its price target to 2,654 pence from 2,725 pence. (Additional reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Catherine Evans)

"GlaxoSmithKline targets growth across units, scraps ViiV IPO",GlaxoSmithKline,0.229,https://www.reuters.com/article/gsk-results-idUKL5N0XX31Y20150506,www.reuters.com,"GlaxoSmithKline targets growth across units, scraps ViiV IPO","LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline laid out growth targets for its biggest businesses on Wednesday, hoping to convince investors that focusing on consumer health and vaccines would return the drugmaker to long-term growth.
It also scrapped plans to float its HIV drug business ViiV Healthcare, citing its strong outlook.
Chief Executive Andrew Witty is under pressure to prove to investors that a $20 billion-plus asset swap with Novartis can revive GSK’s fortunes, following a damaging slide in lung drug sales and a major corruption scandal in China.
Britain’s biggest drugmaker said it expected group sales to rise by a low-to-mid single digit percentage rate annually to 2020. Its pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer health businesses would increase annual sales by low single digits, mid-to-high single digits and mid single digits respectively, it added.
In a bid to protect its dividend, GSK also said it was scaling back plans to return 4 billion pounds ($6 billion) of cash flowing from the Novartis transaction to investors and would instead pay 1 billion as a special dividend.
GSK is showcasing its new divisional structure at an investor day, alongside first-quarter results, which showed a fall in earnings per share, hit by declining sales and prices for its profitable Advair lung drug in the United States.
Quarterly sales were 5.62 billion pounds, unchanged from a year earlier in sterling terms. Core earnings per share (EPS) - the measure followed most closely by investors - were down 18 percent at 17.3 pence.
Analysts, on average, had forecast sales of 5.62 billion pounds and core EPS, which excludes certain items, of 17.4 pence, according to Thomson Reuters.

LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - Anglo-South African financial services firm Old Mutual said first-quarter gross sales rose an above-forecast 18 percent to 7.3 billion pounds ($11.50 billion), but net client cash flows came in below forecast.
Analysts in a company-supplied forecast had expected a 7 billion pound rise in sales for the quarter ending March 31, on a constant currency basis.
Net client cash flows were 500 million pounds, however, against a 1.8 billion pound forecast, the company said in a trading statement on Thursday.
Funds under management rose 10 percent over the quarter to 351 billion pounds, in line with forecasts.

"UPDATE 3-BP settles oil spill-related claims with Halliburton, Transocean",BP,-0.121,https://www.reuters.com/article/halliburton-bp-oilspill-idINL3N0YB5AA20150521,www.reuters.com,"UPDATE 3-BP settles oil spill-related claims with Halliburton, Transocean","(Adds statement from plaintiffs’ attorneys)
May 20 (Reuters) - BP Plc has settled with oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and contract driller Transocean Ltd cross claims related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history.
BP still faces a potential fine of up to $13.7 billion under the U.S. Clean Water Act.
Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig, had settled its Clean Water Act liability for $1 billion. The U.S. government never sued Halliburton under the Act, one person familiar with the case said.
“We have now settled all matters relating to the accident with both our partners in the well and our contractors,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in an email.
Transocean said BP would pay the company $125 million in compensation for legal fees it incurred, adding the companies will mutually release all claims against each other.
The company added BP will also discontinue its attempts to recover as an “additional insured” under Transocean’s liability policies that will accelerate the company’s recovery of about $538 million in insurance claims.
Transocean also said it would pay about $212 million to a fund set up to pay out claims to people and businesses harmed by the spill, subject to the approval by U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
“We applaud Transocean for adding to the settlement funds established in the Halliburton settlement to help compensate people and businesses for their losses,” said co-lead plaintiffs’ attorneys, Stephen Herman and James Roy.
Transocean said it intends to make the payments using cash on hand.
In September, a U.S. judge ruled that BP was mostly at fault and that Transocean and Halliburton were not as much to blame.
Halliburton, which did the cementing work for BP’s well, had earlier blamed BP’s decision to use only six centralizers for the blowout that spilled millions of barrels of oil for 87 days.
Halliburton said in September that it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in the oil spill.
London-based BP has already taken $43.8 billion in pretax charges for clean-up and other costs. (Reporting by Anannya Pramanick and Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru and Terry Wade in Houston; Editing by Don Sebastian and Lisa Shumaker)

UPDATE 1-Cypress Semiconductor offers to buy Integrated Silicon Solution,Integrated Silicon Solution,0.461,https://www.reuters.com/article/integrated-silic-ma-cypress-semicond-idUSL3N0Y47K120150513,www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Cypress Semiconductor offers to buy Integrated Silicon Solution,"(Adds details, analyst comment, shares)
May 13 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor Corp said it offered to buy Integrated Silicon Solution Inc for $19.75 per share in cash, trumping an offer by a Chinese consortium led by Summitview Capital.
Cypress’s cash offer values Integrated Silicon Solution at $627.3 million, based on about 31.8 million shares outstanding as of May 1, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The offer is at a 5.4 percent premium to the stock’s Wednesday close.
If the deal goes through, it will help Cypress continue to shift focus to automotive customers.
The company agreed to buy peer Spansion Inc for $1.59 billion in stock in December to help it shrug off weakness in the smartphone market.
Spansion’s microcontroller chips are used for everything from controlling airbag deployment in cars to rolling down windows.
“Cypress bought Spansion partly due to an explosion in the automotive sector and ISSI has about half its revenue coming from automotive today,” Craig Hallum analyst Richard Shannon told Reuters.
The Chinese consortium had agreed to buy Integrated Silicon for $19.25 per share in cash in March.
Integrated Silicon said in April that it would hold a special shareholder meeting on June 3 to consider the consortium’s proposal.
Integrated Silicon Solution’s shares rose 6.7 percent to $20 in after-market trading on Wednesday, while Cypress’ shares rose nearly 2 percent to $12.89. (Reporting by Kshitiz Goliya in Bengaluru; Editing by Joyjeet Das)

"UPDATE 1-Nomura, RBS must pay $806 mln in mortgage bond case-US judge",RBS,-0.69,https://www.reuters.com/article/fhfa-nomura-hldgs-idUKL1N0Y62ML20150515,www.reuters.com,"UPDATE 1-Nomura, RBS must pay $806 mln in mortgage bond case-U.S. judge","(Adds details on order, comment from Nomura)
NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday ordered Nomura Holdings Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to pay a collective $806 million for making false statements in selling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan entered the judgment after finding the banks liable on Monday following a non-jury bench trial in a lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over securities sold ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.
Under the order, Fannie Mae will receive $26.6 million while Freddie Mac will be paid $779.4 million by the two firms.
The damages amount was in line with an estimate given to Reuters on Tuesday by a lawyer for the FHFA, which has acted as conservator for Fannie and Freddie since their 2008 government takeover.
While RBS was ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, Nomura has agreed to an indemnify the bank, a person familiar with the matter said.
The banks also under the order will receive back the mortgage bonds the FHFA sued over, which a defense expert witness at trial estimated were worth $434 million to $479 million as of March 26.
Nomura in a statement said it will appeal, saying it “takes this situation very seriously and strongly disagrees with the outcome of the case.”
Representatives for the FHFA and RBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit was the first of 18 to reach trial filed by the regulator in 2011 over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The FHFA has obtained nearly $17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG. Those deals followed adverse rulings by Cote.
Following a non-jury trial, Cote ruled against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals.
“The offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans,” Cote wrote. “The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous.”
