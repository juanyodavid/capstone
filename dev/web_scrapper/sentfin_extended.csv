Mid caps now turn into market darlings,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tide-turns-as-midcaps-become-brokerages-darling-again/articleshow/68350992.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Tide turns as midcaps become brokerages' darling, again","Mid- and small-cap shares are back on brokerages’ radar after remaining out of favour for over a year. A key reason behind it is that the current government's chances to come back to power after elections have improved following India’s military standoff with Pakistan. That is why the broader market has seen buying. As a result, midcaps have rebounded strongly. 

The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices have gained 4.4 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in the past two weeks, compared to the Sensex which is up 2.2 per cent during the same period. In 2018, BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices had fallen 13.4 per cent and 23.7 per cent, respectively. Also, there were macro headwinds and concerns about corporate governance and liquidity issues and there was lack of pick-up in earnings growth. Analysts believe the tide seems to be turning in favour of the broader market again. 

“Typically, the spread between large-cap and mid-cap returns has peaked out at 15-20 per cent. Post hitting this peak range, the performance has reversed in the past. Currently, this spread stands at 18 per cent,” said Motilal Oswal in a note. ET takes a look at midcap picks of top brokerages and their outlook going forward.


CLSA



SADBHAV ENGINEERING
CMP: Rs 223.35
Change in last one year : -41.8 per cent

Despite the recent 44 per cent rally since its low, Sadbhav Engineering’s stock trades at 7 times FY20 adjusted earnings and its valuation appears attractive, said foreign brokerage CLSA. The brokerage has added the midcap stock to its portfolio.


SOBHA
CMP: Rs 438.7
Change in last one year : -20 per cent

Sobha is another midcap in CLSA’s model portfolio. The foreign brokerage said the launch of Sobha’s second affordable project should help drive sales in the near term. “Sobha’s timely new launches amidst tough liquidity conditions for developers should help it gain market share significantly. ” said CLSA in a recent report, while retaining buy rating with a target price of Rs 628.


GODREJ PROPERTIES
CMP: Rs 699.55
Change in last one year : -6.7 per cent

Godrej Properties delivered good operating performance in the third quarter and this performance comes amidst tight liquidity for the sector, demonstrating Godrej’s strength and ability to gain from the ongoing sector consolidation, said CLSA. Access to cheap liquidity, a good delivery trackrecord and its timely expansion make Godrej well poised to gain market share, said CLSA.


MOTILAL OSWAL


INDRAPRASTHA GAS
CMP: Rs 293.35
Change in last one year : -5.5 per cent

Indraprastha Gas is one of Motilal Oswal’s preferred midcap ideas. The brokerage said in a recent report that Indraprastha Gas’ consistent operational outperformance, the government’s thrust on gas usage, and sustainable high-growth market warrant premium valuations. The recent Supreme Court ruling for Indraprastha to take over the assets of Haryana City Gas Distribution is another positive from the short- to medium-term volume growth perspective, said Motilal Oswal.


FEDERAL BANK
CMP: Rs 87.65
Change in last one year : -5.8 per cent

Federal Bank has maintained strong business momentum and it is reporting a gradual improvement in operating earnings. Strong capitalization levels and a robust liability franchise will enable market share gains in both corporate and retail segments, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 115.


SUN TV NETWORK
CMP: Rs 596.35
Change in last one year : -33.4 per cent

Motilal Oswal expects 12 per cent compounded growth in advertisement revenue over FY19 -FY21 on the back of new launches and increasing share of commission model-based shows. This, coupled with a foray in the Bangla genre, augurs well for the company, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report on Sun TV. Burgeoning IPL revenue is also expected to provide a fillip to overall revenue, it added.


CITIGROUP
SRF
CMP: Rs 2,351.85
Change in last one year : 27.3 per cent

SRF is among Citi’s top midcap ideas. SRF’s unique fluorine chemistry skills, history of innovation and operational management track-record, along with its proven ability to extract profits from even commoditized businesses, provide a long growth runway, said Citi.


SHRIRAM TRANSPORT FINANCE CO.
CMP: Rs 1,220.30
Change in last one year : -8.1 per cent

Shriram Transport’s niche focus on used vehicle segment and diversified borrowing profile positions it better to navigate through the liquidity challenges and tide over the cyclical nature of vehicle industry, said Citi. Whole the gross nonperforming asset ratio remains elevated at around 9 per cent, higher provision coverage ratio alleviates any major asset quality concern, it added. The stock trades at 1.7 times adjusted price-to-book on March 2020 estimates versus long term average of 2.1 times, said Citi.


EMAMI
CMP: Rs 383.1
Change in last one year : -29.3 per cent

Emami has underperformed the sector given its weak performance in multiple quarters. However, revenue trends are improving and three of its four segments are recovering as well, said Citigroup Global Markets. Valuations at 29 times FY20 adjusted EPS is well below sector peers and group leverage has reduced after promoters divested 10 per cent stake in the company, added Citi.

Infosys: Will the strong volume growth sustain?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-will-the-strong-volume-growth-sustain/articleshow/21033072.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys: Will the strong volume growth sustain?,"MUMBAI: A stronger business volume growth and sustained momentum in new client accounts are brighter spots in the performance of Infosys in the first quarter of FY14. However, the management's stance to keep dollar denominated revenue guidance unchanged at 6-10% growth for the fiscal reflects that caution is still the buzzword. 

 Infosys, the second largest among the IT exporters that are listed on Indian bourses, reported 7.8% sequential growth in revenue at Rs 11,267 crore for the June 2013 quarter, surpassing the analysts' average estimate of 5.5% growth. The ET Intelligence Group (ETIG) had predicted 6.7% sequential increase in revenue. 

 Operating profit or earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) however lagged the ETIG's estimation of Rs 2,778.4 crore. The company reported Rs 2,664 crore in EBIT, a sequential growth of 8.2%. 

 The company was able to retain the operating margin calculated as the proportion of EBIT in the revenue at 23.6% compared with the previous quarter. For the September 2013 quarter, however, its CFO Rajiv Bansal has cited a negative impact of around 300 basis points on profitability due to the salary hikes of average 8% initiated at the beginning of July. 

 The stock market has reacted positively to the results. At Rs 2,810, the stock has gained over 11% in the morning session on Friday. The big jump can be attributed to a sharp increase in the rupee denominated revenue guidance by the company to 13-17% for the fiscal from the earlier forecast of 6-10% growth. 

 The company has been finding it difficult to report meaningful growth since the past few years. Against the backdrop, what could offer some relief to investors is the fact that it reported a strong 4.1% volume growth for the quarter, which is the largest since the September 2011 quarter when it had reported 4.5% jump. In addition, it continued to show momentum in new clients. It added 66 clients during the June 2013 quarter. 

 But, any major increase in the stock valuation from the current levels looks limited. This is because the company still faces pressure on its growth and margin, which is reflected from its stance of not revising the dollar denominated revenue guidance of 6-10% growth for the fiscal. 

 Also, it will be challenging to retain the strong volume growth amidst clouded outlook for IT demand. The management has iterated about the slowing offtake in the high-end, high-margin, discretionary projects. A rerating of the stock would require the company to show a sustained growth scenario in the coming quarters.
