The empire strikes back: Why gold will matter in 2014,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/the-empire-strikes-back-why-gold-will-matter-in-2014/articleshow/31356898.cms,m.economictimes.com,The empire strikes back: Why gold will matter in 2014,"MUMBAI: The year 2013 was a forgettable one for gold investors as they watched the precious metal sink 27% after a remarkable bull run lasting nearly a decade. When prices reached $1,200 levels some time last year, most experts predicted that the gold rally was over.

So far this year, those predictions have not turned out to be exactly right. Gold has managed to buck the trend, rising 10.4% year to date as emerging market economic weakness combined with rising geopolitical tensions revived its status as a safe haven.

Gold investor and strategist Eric Sprott, who has steadfastly refused to buy the theory of erosion of investor faith in precious metals, and has instead alluded to central bank manipulation as the reason behind the 2013 price fall (read his post at www.zerohedge.com on January 17), is today more bullish than ever about gold. “The price of gold and silver will both hit new highs in 2014,” he said in a blog post on January 9. “The price of gold goes north of $2,000, and silver will quickly go over $50. When it does, it will get a little crazy.”

Gold’s rise this year, which has not been as spectacular as its proponents think, has been aided by strong demand and geopolitical spats in the Pacific Ocean and Crimea.

Russia sent troops into Crimea over the weekend and appears to be slowly increasing its stranglehold on the strategically located peninsula. China and Japan are locked in a standoff over islands and in comments that reverberated around the world in January, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese PM, compared the face-off to UK-Germany rivalry before the world war.

These tensions could keep gold on the boil in the next few months but what is really causing concern among economists and traders is the weakness in the Chinese economy and signs of an apparent softness in the US economy. Bloomberg reported on Monday that hedge funds increased the bullish gold wagers to the highest in 14 months on worries that the US recovery may be stumbling. China, it is feared, is possibly in the midst of a sharp slowdown and the government appears to have its hands full, fighting fires on all fronts including currency and local demand. The yuan is weakening and growth is slipping.

So where does this leave India, one of the biggest gold importers? Not in a very good position from the looks of it. Finance minister P Chidambaram fought off a current account deficit crisis last year by slamming the door shut on gold imports. Those restrictions (an increase in duty to 10% and a ban on imports of gold coins) have served their purpose well and the rupee has been remarkably stable so far.


	 
Many experts have said that the time has come to remove those restrictions.

The government is playing it cautious so far, afraid that it will be swamped with imports despite the recent price increase. This government is unlikely to take a call on the issue. The new government, to be sworn in by end of May, will probably have to bite the bullet on this one. The trouble is they will be damned if they do and damned if they don’t.

Cut duties back to pre-May 2013 levels and you risk increasing demand, widen the deficit and possibly spook the rupee. They can’t afford that. Maintaining those levels beyond the next few months will serve no purpose at all except to increase smuggling and the misery of thousands of families dependent on gold for their livelihood.

Those who thought that the tyranny of gold ended with its slide last year, think again. This will be the year of gold."

Ujjivan Financial has received the licence for a small bank and is planning an IPO to raise `1,500 crore in order to meet Reserve Bank of India’s shareholding norms. 

 At present, about 90% of the company is owned by foreign investors. It has given the mandate to Axis Capital and IIFL for the IPO.

UTI AMC shortlists 3 names for Chairman and MD position,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/uti-amc-shortlists-3-names-for-chairman-and-md-position/articleshow/15396675.cms,m.economictimes.com,UTI AMC shortlists 3 names for Chairman and MD position,"NEW DELHI: UTI AMC, India's oldest asset management company with assets of around Rs 61,000 crore, could finally have a permanent boss after being headless for the last 18 months. The AMC's board has recommended to its shareholders names of three candidates for the position of chairman and managing director, two persons familiar with the development told ET. The shortlisted candidates are AIG India chief executive and country head Sunil Mehta, senior advisor at McKinsey & Co in India Leo Puri, and Punita Kumar Sinha, former senior managing director of Blackstone Group's India-focused mutual fund. 

 A final decision will be taken by the five shareholders of UTI AMC - LIC, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and T Rowe Price. The four Indian shareholders hold 18.5% each while the US-based T Rowe Price owns a 26% stake. 

 The board has also recommended the name of an internal UTI AMC executive as a fallback option if the shareholders do not agree on the three external candidates. 

 UTI Mutual Fund director Sachit Jain, who is part of the three-member search committee constituted by the board, said the board had sent the names of shortlisted candidates to the shareholders but declined to disclose their names. The UTI board chairman, PR Khanna, refused to comment and the three candidates, Puri, Mehta and Sinha, too, declined to comment. 

 Puri, the former head of McKinsey India, rejoined the consulting firm in December 2011 as senior advisor after serving a four-and-a-half-year stint as managing director of private equity major Warburg Pincus. He serves on the boards of Max India and Max Healthcare. 

 Mehta has been the country head and chief executive of AIG India and is responsible for all of its Indian businesses, including life and general insurance, financial services and investments. Prior to joining AIG, he was with Citibank for over 18 years. 

 Sinha, the daughter-in-law of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, was in-charge of Oppenheimer's India-focused fund which was subsequently taken over by Blackstone. The fund with asset under management of about $1.22 billion was sold to Aberdeen Asset Management in December 2011. 

 UTI AMC, which runs India's fifth largest mutual fund, has not had a full-fledged chairman since UK Sinha left UTI to become the head of market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India in February 2011.
 
 
  

 Sinha's departure was followed by an unseemly row between the finance ministry and T Rowe Price over the choice of his successor. While the finance ministry pushed for the appointment of Jitesh Khosla, a 1979 batch IAS officer and brother of Omita Paul, the powerful advisor of former finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, as the UTI AMC chairman, T Rowe Price insisted that a professional should be appointed. 

 Several permutations and combinations, including splitting the CMD's post into two, were discussed, but the deadlock could not be broken. A few board members also quit as UTI AMC slipped from fourth to fifth position in the mutual fund league table. Finally, earlier this year, Imtaiyazur Rahman was appointed interim CEO. 

 Once shareholders select and approve the name of the CMD, it will be ratified by the trustees of UTI."

The company is currently trading at a EV per ton of $35, which is nearly 30% lower than the average valuation of small and mid size peers. 

 Owing to higher dispatch volumes, the company has been able to report an EBIDTA margin of over 16% since the last three quarters. In the quarter ending June 2012, Mangalam Cements reported an EBIDTA per ton of Rs 765, which is in line with its mid size peers. Due to lower coal costs, cement manufacturers are likely to maintain this EBIDTA margins in the coming months. 

 The company is in the process of expanding its capacity by 1.25 million tons per annum (MTPA). With this, the total capacity of the company would reach to 3.25 MTPA by FY14. The total capex for the expansion is nearly Rs 500 crore. Due to a healthy balance sheet (Debt-to-Equity of 0.05), the company would not have any trouble in incurring the capex. In addition, with a higher capacity, the company will have better control on its input cost, which will in turn result in stable earnings."

Here's what Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst, Swastika Investmart Ltd. at recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Hindustan Unilever: BuyThe counter is coming out from a long consolidation channel on the daily chart while on the weekly chart, it has witnessed a breakout of bullish Inverse head & shoulder and retest to its neckline support at around Rs 2,462 level.

Reliance Industries: BuyThe counter is in a descending triangle formation on the longer time frame. It is also facing a trend line and 200-DMA resistance at around Rs 2,500-2,550 zone.

To continue this momentum for upside, the counter has to break out of this Rs 2,500-2,550 zone. Above this, we can expect Rs 2,700 level in the near term.

Bajaj Finserv: BuyIn Friday’s trading session, the counter formed a bearish engulfing candle formation with long channel consolidation on the daily chart.

The overall structure of the counter is remunerative as it trades above its all-important moving averages.

Who is buying defunct Kingfisher Airlines' shares on the bourses?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/who-is-buying-defunct-kingfisher-airlines-shares-on-the-bourses/articleshow/46831063.cms,m.economictimes.com,Who is buying defunct Kingfisher Airlines' shares on the bourses?,"MUMBAI: The prospects of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines making a comeback seem remote with the government cancelling its licence and lenders declaring founder Vijay Mallya a wilful defaulter. But, some on Dalal Street appear to be hoping otherwise. In the last couple of months, the market capitalisation of Kingfisher has jumped 40% to Rs 131 crore.
 
 The stock rose 4.9% to Rs 1.71 on Monday. Kingfisher shares are actively traded every Monday — the only day in the week when the stock is allowed to be transacted. Kingfisher was suspended from trading by stock exchanges for violation of listing agreement including non-disclosure of shareholding pattern or results. But exchange sources said Kingfisher Airlines shares were allowed to trade once a week as regulations provide for a six-month trading window to suspended companies.
 
In the last two weeks, about 10 lakh shares of Kingfisher Airlines have been traded on the special trading day. So, it boils down to the question: Who is buying these shares? Stock exchanges have said that no official data is available with them as the company has stopped filing its shareholding pattern since September 2014. Then, the promoter holding led by Vijay Mallya was 8.54% and domestic institutions held close to 10%.
 
 In 2010, Mallya-led promoter group held over 66% and institutions had more than 15%. Market sources said it is the socalled ‘friendly circles’ active in the stock. They have been selling a portion of their stakes in the last few weeks, while the buyers have been retail and some affluent investors. Brokers said retail investors are speculating that the company could make a comeback which has resulted in the recent activity in the stock. The high net-worth investors may be punting for some quick gains or taxation purposes, brokers added. ""It is a pump-and-dump operation,"" said a Mumbai-based broker. ""The friendly circles have large holdings in it and are rigging the share price to gain attraction of small traders. These operators then dump their shares.""
 
 So, is there any hope of Kingfisher's revival? Unlikely, said brokers. Set-up in 2003, Kingfisher Airlines never saw a single year of profit since it got listed in 2006. The stock had hit a high of Rs 280 in mid-2007 — the peak of the previous bull run. The company is among India’s top non-performing assets as it has failed to repay loans of over Rs 4,000 crore, mostly borrowed from state-owned banks. Its net losses in stood at Rs 822.42 crore for the third quarter of financial year 2014. As part of the recovery process, banks in February 2014 last year decided to sell a portion of the collateral with them, including shares of its group companies United Spirits and Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers, Mallya's Goa villa, Kingfisher House in Mumbai and the Kingfisher brand, which was valued at over Rs 4,000 crore at the time it was pledged.
 
 Brokers said investors who are still holding the shares should use the weekly window to sell as the possibility of Kingfisher Airlines starting operations is dim."

MUMBAI: It is clear from investors' behaviour in recent weeks and months that worries about a setback to the bull run are probably the last thing on their minds. 


	Since mid-January, the news for the Narendra Modi-led NDA government has been uniformly bad. The rate cut apart, there were the Delhi elections where the BJP was whipped badly. The GDP data revisions were greeted with widespread scepticism and the core sector and PMI manufacturing data have disappointed. The Budget, universally, expected to deliver big bang reforms, has ended up doing exactly the opposite: a number of small, but important measures aimed at putting together a framework, a structure in place for faster decision-making, growth and reforms.


	Corporate sector earnings growth is showing no sign of picking up. If the third quarter was bad, the fourth quarter is not expected to be much better. Investment is trickling in but there are no bigticket bets as yet thanks to weak demand and debt-laden balance sheets.


	Despite all this, investors are continuing to buy. In January, offshore funds bought Rs 17,689 crore worth of equities. In February, this figure Rs 8,793 crore. Domestic institutional investors purchased Rs 9,592 crore of shares in the two months. The index has gained 9.92% so far this year, outpacing most of its emerging market peers. In the past one year, India's market cap has grown 49.1% just lower than China's 63.9% and far bigger than South Africa's measly 9.8% growth. The less said about Russia and Brazil the better.


	Much of the growth has been about sentiment. The prospects of a BJP-led victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections fuelled a sharp rally which swept in its wake stocks of capital goods and power companies in the hope that the Modi's emphasis will be on triggering a revival in heavy investment and manufacturing. It is now clear that such investments will take a long time. But investors, especially those of the long-term variety, don't appear to be unhappy . They appear to be extremely pleased by the attention to longterm reforms and the building of a framework needed to spur investment and earnings rate growth. Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai is among the most bullish. ""We estimate a 24% CAGR in Sensex earnings in the coming two years compared with 17% estimated by the bottom-up consensus. We continue to be bullish on Indian equities with our key overweight positions being private sector banks, industrials, discretionary consumption and technology ,"" he wrote in a piece for ET a day after the Budget.


	Three key decisions of the government stand out in this regard in the Budget. First, the setting up of the bankruptcy court with its own rules and regulations, the infrastructure thrust with the increased outlays on roads and railways and the clarity on direct tax and treatment of MAT for FIIs. If you add to this, the monetary policy framework agreed with the RBI, and the formation of a committee to prepare a draft legislation for faster project implementation, it is clear that the government is moving fast towards putting in place the necessary structure needed to speed up growth. The bankruptcy court is important for clearing up the NPAs in the banking system, some of which may not be recoverable at all and for speeding up decisions on sick companies; the plugand-play projects will ease the doing business with the government promising projects that have all clearances in place.


	A hybrid public-private-partnership model, proposed for road projects by the transport minister Nitin Gadkari, could solve some of the problems for road and other infrastructure companies though issues such as debt burden will still play a part in kick-starting private sector participation. The monetary policy framework with RBI provides clarity on inflation targeting.


	 

	
	Some fund managers and experts are worried about valuation. Since much of the growth has come from PE expansion and not from earnings growth, there is understandable nervousness at rising prices. But are the fears justified? It is interesting to note that much of the gains in market cap and PE expansion have happened in large-cap and mid-cap companies with strong growth potential. For instance, the biggest gains in BSE 100 since January 2012 has been in Bharat Forge, United Spirits, HCL Tech, Kotak Mahindra, Sun Pharma, Maruti Suzuki, Shriram Transport, Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints and Tata Motors. A similar exercise from May 16, 2014, the day of the election results, also shows that the biggest PE expansions have happened in the frontline stocks. The big losers have been Reliance Communications, Jaiprakash Associates, GMR, Tata Steel, Cairn India and other commodity-oriented stocks.


	Clearly, investors are picking out winners and losers and seem to have avoided the heavy debt-laden companies who have issues of project execution and fund-raising.


	No doubt, there will come a time when the PE expansion will stop. Without earnings growth it will be silly to expect prices to keep moving up continuously. But with EBITDA margins inching up for large-cap companies and price-toearnings ratios still below the 24 year-average, the risk of a catastrophic collapse in equity share prices appear remote."
Wipro likely to sell water business; Focus more on core,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/wipro-likely-to-sell-water-business-focus-more-on-core/articleshow/8156228.cms,m.economictimes.com,Wipro likely to sell water business; Focus more on core,"BANGALORE: Soaps-to-software major Wipro is evaluating the options to sell off its water business and sharpen its focus on the existing revenue streams, at least two people familiar with the internal discussions said.
  
  Wipro entered the water business in 2008 through the acquisition of water treatment firm Aquatech and executes water treatment projects for large industrial customers, including United Breweries, PepsiCo and Coca Cola.
  
  “Investment in this business started with the sustainability theme but in the past few years the company has seen significant competition with several large, established players in this field. So, it is now focusing on other areas,” the first person said.
  
  While there is no formal proposal with the Wipro board yet, and discussions with potential buyers have not reached a final stage, the deliberations are part of the group’s strategy to streamline businesses and ensure focus on growing units.
  
  “I wouldn’t call it a wild speculation, have heard discussions on this subject several times,” said a person who has advised Wipro on M&A transactions in the past.
  
  Though IT services makes up for over 75% of Wipro’s revenues, the balance comes from several other business, including Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, eco-energy and hardware products. Spreading itself too thin and entering too many non-IT related areas may not pay off in the long run, industry watchers said.
  
  “An IT company being in these completely unrelated businesses is not very convincing,” an analyst with a Mumbai-based brokerage house said.
  
  Wipro has also restructured its IT business in the past few months after it disbanded its joint CEO model and announced a more verticalised structure that would make it swifter and more agile.
  
  In the past three years, Wipro has often articulated its ambition of becoming a “one-stop shop” in the water purification and treatment business and counts global majors like GSK Pharma and Coca-Cola among customers. The company provides complete solutions, including providing the process, designing and manufacturing plants,
  commissioning plants and if the customers want, running the plant. The company also gives solutions to reduce usage of fresh water for customers.
  
  Wipro’s water business is a part of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, a division that also delivers precision-engineered hydraulic cylinders, components and solutions and truck hydraulics components to original equipment manufacturers globally in the infrastructure and related industries. The division, headed by Pratik Kumar, contributes less than 10% to Wipro’s revenues at present.
  
  The company sees this division growing to a billion dollar in revenue in the next 3-4 years and it is placing its bets on hydraulic cylinders and manufacturing components for aviation and defence contractors. The company has identified Brazil and China as new manufacturing hubs for its hydraulics business."

  Once again intraday try to breach 5400, is that a cue that we could possibly see a much significant downside in the next few days to come?
   
  We have already seen three consecutive days of downside from 5600 down to 5400. 5400 was a fairly key level, which historically has provided quite a bit of support. Now we are at fairly low levels in the market, we have fallen about 600-700 points, so now the falls are not as sharp as before. 
  
  You are seeing these pullback rallies, so you can say right now the range for the next two or three days is 5400 to say about 5470 but slowly we are trying to go down, maybe not immediately but 5330-5350 seems like a possibility over the next few days."

 Those bonds have been priced at 210 basis points over and above the 10-year US Treasury bond yields, which would offer a final rate of 4.37 per cent, two persons associated with the deal told ET. A basis point is 0.01 per cent.
 
 ""Amid competing supply from several other Asian issuances this issuance managed to garner interest of high quality investors from US, Asia and Europe,"" said Pushkaraj Gumaste, head of client coverage, Barclays India. ""This has enabled Bharti Airtel to achieve the tightest ever price on its bond offerings.""
 
 Last year the company obtained a spread or gap of 270 bps when they had sold 10-year bonds offering 5.35 per cent.
 
 Bharti Airtel has approached investors for issuance of debt instruments in the form of dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes with 10-year maturities, the company said in a notice to the stock exchanges. It will use the bond proceeds for its capital expenditure.
 
 Three rating companies — Moody’s, S&P and Fitch — have rated the issuance with Baa3, BBB- and BBB- grades, respectively. These offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within US investors only.?
 
 ""As the company has committed to applying excess cash flows to debt reduction, this will not result in an increase in leverage,"" said Annalisa Di Chiara, vice-president and senior analyst, at Moody's. ""At the same time, this transaction will extend Bharti's debt maturity profile, which is credit positive.""
 
 Six banks are arranging the bond issuance — Deutsche Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered.
 
 The company which reported a net debt of $10.68 billion for the year ending 2014-15 has so far raised close to $4 billion through bonds in the past two years. Airtel currently hold a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.08.
 
 Airtel clocked revenue of Rs 92,039 crore growing by 7.3 per cent over the previous year for the full year ending March 31, 2015.
 
 ""We believe that its net debt for the financial year to 31 March 2016 will reduce as we expect it to use its available cash and equivalents of $2.2 billion and expected proceeds of $2 billion from the sale of African tower assets to repay part of its $10.6 billion in net debt,"" rating agency Fitch said while rating the company’s bond offering as BBB-."
Alkem Labs May Inspire Other Pharma Cos to Take IPO Path,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/alkem-labs-may-inspire-other-pharma-cos-to-take-ipo-path/articleshow/50038507.cms,m.economictimes.com,Alkem Labs May Inspire Other Pharma Cos to Take IPO Path,"Mumbai: India's IPO (initial public offering) market could see a flurry of activity this financial year with several promoters wanting to cash in on increasing investor appetite for new issues, according to investment bank Nomura Financial Advisory. 
 
 From the capital market perspective this is possibly the best year in the last three to five years.The quality of IPOs that is coming is spectacular“ said Utpal Oza, managing director and head of investment banking for Nomura Financial Advisory , which is one of the lead advisors of Alkem Laboratories, which will hit the market with an IPO next week. 

 Alkem's IPO will be watched by other players in the sector as the drug maker is listing on the bourses after almost a decade. 

 According to Oza, from the capital market perspective, this is possibly the best year in the last three to five years. “The feedback from investors for Alkem is also exciting. So from capital market perspective, we are in a great place,“ he told ET in an interview. 

 Oza is betting big on the Alkem IPO as he feels the success of this issue will inspire other pharma companies of Alkem's size to hit the market. “If you look at the top 20 domestic pharma companies, you still have lot of unlisted companies. You got Emcure where Bain Capital is the investor, we have Intas which went down the IPO path but put that on path but put that on hold, you have Macleods, Micro Labs, and Aristo Pharma. So, we are hoping this will spur a lot of entrepreneurs to think that this is the right way to go,“ Oza said. 

 According to the investment bank, the inter est in Alkem is mixed with domestic investors taking a lead. It expects a 60:40 mix of domestic and foreign investors. 

 On mergers and acquisitions, Oza said the coming year will witness domestic consolidation across sectors, unlike earlier times when promoters were not keen on selling to other Indian buyers. “I think the speed with which Indians can move, the knowledge of the environment, the ability to take a call on diligence is appreciated. And we see this not only in distressed sectors, but across domestic industries,“ Oza added. He further expects that in defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer, stock as a currency would be used as a key instrument in mergers. 

 “The eagerness of Indian companies looking at cross border deals is also growing, Oza said.“We never had it so good in last three years.“"
Alok Sinha takes over as new Airports Authority of India chief,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/alok-sinha-takes-over-as-new-airports-authority-of-india-chief/articleshow/29311356.cms,m.economictimes.com,Alok Sinha takes over as new Airports Authority of India chief,"NEW DELHI: Alok Sinha, a Joint Secretary in the Civil Aviation Ministry, today took over as the new Chairman of Airports Authority of India (AAI) replacing V P Agrawal who headed the state-run airports body for five years. 

 Sinha, who handles airport-related matters in the Ministry, has been given additional charge of the post till a new Chairman is found, official sources said. 

 Agarwal, whose term ended in December, was asked to continue in the post from January one till further orders. 

 The sources said the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) declined to allow him an extension. Agrawal, who still has one-and-a-half years of service left, had risen from the AAI ranks to become the Chairman. 

 His tenure saw the modernisation of a large number of major airports as also that of several non-metro ones, besides the joint development of India's satellite-based navigation system GAGAN, which would be operationalised by June-July. 

 Agrawal's sudden exit came at a time when the government was on a fast-track mode to privatise six airports, recently modernised by the AAI at a cost of several thousand crore rupees from the public exchequer. 

 Government had last September allowed private parties to pick up 100 per cent equity in operation and management of these airports at Chennai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Lucknow through public-private partnership. 

 Several meetings of an Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) have been taking place on a regular basis in the past few weeks to take the privatisation process forward at a break-neck speed. The IMG is understood to have suggested the creation of a Group of Ministers to take the process forward. 

 This is being apparently done to conclude the privatisation process before the Model Code of Conduct for the general elections becomes effective. 

 The privatisation move has not only been opposed by AAI employees but also by the parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture, headed by senior CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury."

 The incumbent CEO, Lalit Jalan, has been switched to group level operations as director of corporate strategy. ""He will steer future growth initiatives and efforts of the group with this new responsibility,"" the company said. Three group executives, on condition of anonymity, said that Anil Ambani wanted his Wharton classmate Jalan to focus on group-level strategy.
 
 The plan to change Jalan's profile was in the making for a while but was put on hold until the launch of the Mumbai Metro 1 project. Jalan did not respond to ET's calls or emails. Reliance Infrastructure also did not respond to ET's queries.
 
 But the sources cited earlier said that Anil Ambani wants to build a new team to lead Reliance Infrastructure as well as group company Reliance Power. They said there is also a possibility that the two companies could have a common leadership team though no final decision has been taken.
 
 The CEO's position in Reliance Power has been lying vacant for nine months after JP Chalasani, another trusted lieutenant of Ambani, quit citing a desire to pursue entrepreneurial ambitions. However, he joined Punj Lloyd as CEO after a three-month break.
 
 Before his resignation, Reliance Power had lost its chief financial officer Deepak Maheshwari and Ashwin Kumar. President of business development. Maheshwari joined Essar Energy, while Kumar is now with L&T's power arm.
 
 ""Jalan has been hand-on trying to resolve problems in projects. But R-Infra's challenges continue as big ticket development project like the second phase of Mumbai Metro is stranded and the order pipeline in the contracting business has been very weak,"" an executive from the company said.
 
 Reliance Infrastructure, which acts both as a developer as well as a contractor for projects in sectors such as roadways, metro rail, and airports, has suffered from the economic slowdown.
 
 A high-profile project, the extension of Mumbai's Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which it had bagged through a bidding process, was eventually scrapped as it could not agree on terms with the state government. It has also pulled out of the agreement with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for operating the Airport Metro Express line, while the second phase of Mumbai Metro project that it was to develop faces cancellation.
 
 Company and industry sources said that the Reliance Group will now focus only on operational projects for the time being at least until new projects start taking off. Reliance Infra's new CEO Mehta was with the Vedanta group for 14 years, of which in the last five years he was Group CEO of Vedanta Resources.
 
 Prior to taking over as the Group CEO of Vedanta, he was the CEO of Hindustan Zinc. The company is banking on his project execution and value unlocking skills to drive Reliance Infrastructure's growth.
 
 While Mehta could not be reached for comments, industry sources said that his key mandate could be to expand Reliance Infrastructure's engineering, procurement and construction business and tapping opportunities to divest projects under development."

 Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are currently allowed to invest up to Rs 129,900 crore in central government securities under the auction route. This limit will be increased by Rs 5,500 crore from January 1 next year. 

 As of December 30, limits available for investment by FPIs stood at Rs 1,858 crore. 

 ""The final bidding amount i.e new incremental debt limit of Rs 5,500 crore, along with the free limit as on January 1, 2016 within the Rs 129,900 crore limit shall be informed via separate circular,"" BSE said. 

 The auction will be conducted on BSE's ebidxchange from 1530 hours to 1730 hours, after the close of market hours on Monday, January 4, the exchange said in a circular.

 Consequently, exchange would conduct an auction for the allocation of unutilised debt limits on August 31. 

 A mock bidding session was conducted on Friday to check the system performance, BSE (formerly known as Bombay Stock Exchange) said. 

 During earlier auctions, government bonds have always been subscribed multiple times, given the huge interest among foreign investors, while the demand for corporate bonds remains less. 

 Earlier this month, National Stock Exchange (NSE) conducted an auction for government bonds worth Rs 556 crore, which attracted bids worth Rs 974 crore. 

 Foreign investors are allowed to invest up to $25 billion (Rs 1,24,432 crore) in government debt securities through auction while an investment of up to $5 billion (Rs 29,137 crore) is permitted 'on tap'.

 This target is almost 13 times the index’s close of 8,537.65 on Tuesday.
 
 Jhunjhunwala told a news channel that the Nifty has grown 10 times in the last 15 years and can jump 10-12 times in the next decade. “With the outlook for India, which is much better for the next 10 years than the growth in the past 10 years, and with increasing investor participation, don’t you think the next 10 years should not be 10 but 15 times Nifty?” the investor told the channel, declining to give a target for 2015.
 
 He said the market will be surprised by the country’s growth in the coming years with Narendra Modi at its helm.
 
 “Modi is an instrument. He is an instrument of change; he is not the change. The most remarkable thing of his first 180 days is that he has decided to do things at a measure and pace which is possible,” said Jhunjhunwala. “The pace of change which he is bringing about is the one which the country and the situation and circumstances can absorb,” he said.
 
 He said the government’s Swachh Bharat programme is the best investment this country can make. “It is five times more dividend than spending on health. So, you have to look at the completeness of the picture,” he said.
 
 Jhunjhunwala said a year later, Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan will regret not having cut rates in the policy review meeting on December 2. “This is because inflation will be 4% in India next year. We have had an unprecedented fall in oil prices,” he said. “The worst is behind us and now we are importing 7% of gross domestic product as commodities. That benefit is yet to percolate down,” he said."

Top five trading bets,"By Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com


	The Nifty opened the week with a subdued note and traded with a negative bias. The index registered an intra-week high of 6358.30 levels. 


	Since then the index witnessed selling pressure which led it to register an intra-week low of 6171.25 levels. Eventually the Nifty closed at the 6211.15 levels with a loss 102.65 points for the week ended 3 January.


	The Nifty has been trading in the crucial trading range for the past couple of days. In this week the index registered an intraday breakout from the above-mentioned range, but could not sustain at higher levels and witnessed heavy selling pressure. 


	On the weekly chart the Nifty has formed double top near the resistance trend line of the trading zone. Currently, the Nifty has taken support from the lower end of the zone. Going forward, the Nifty is likely to trade in the same trading range of 6190 -- 6320 levels.

	
	
					
	
	A close on the either side of this trading range would lead the Nifty to accelerate momentum in the direction of a breakout.


	Sustaining above 6,320 levels, the Nifty can head towards 6370/6415 levels. On the downside the Nifty has support at 6260/6230/6190/6130 followed by 6000/5960 levels.

UBS and HSBC also lowered their equity index targets recently.
 
 The US firm has reduced the Sensex target to 32,000 from 33,000 for December. UBS cut the Nifty target to 9,200 from 9,600 and HSBC reduced the Sensex target to 26,900 from 30,100 by the year-end.
 
 The US firm caveated its estimate by saying that investors should keep their faith in Indian markets, although many are turning fickle over a slowdown in earnings growth, foreign fund outflows and underperformance of benchmark indices against other markets.
 
 
The Sensex and Nifty were both marginally down on Thursday, the first ended at 27,809 points and the second at 8,421 points. The markets should pick up pace significantly next year, according to Citi, which expects Sensex to surge to 35,000 and Nifty to 10,600 by June 2016.
 The global investment firm has become more bullish on bank stocks and retained its overweight rating on sectors such as auto, cement and pharma, while moving telecom to overweight from neutral.
 
 The year has seen Indian stocks losing some of their edge. The MSCI India has gained 2% so far this year, underperforming the MSCI EM Index, which has gained 8.1% over the same period. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled Rs 10,500 crore out of Indian equities since mid-April.
 
 Citi has recommended Adani Ports, Aurobindo Pharma, Axis Bank, Bharti Infratel, Coal India, Dr Reddy’s, HCL Technologies, HDFC Bank, Mahindra and Mahindra and State Bank of India as top picks in the largecap space. Top picks in the midcap sector are Apollo Hospitals, Bharat Forge, Container Corp., Emami, Exide, Info Edge, JSW Energy, Petronet LNG, Titan and YES Bank.
 
 The firm said investor concerns about the market include the sluggish economy, expensive market valuations, foreign fund outflows and high expectations from the government being unmet. But these concerns can be addressed as growth is showing signs of revival, interest rates are heading lower, domestic flows have strengthened and there is no easing of the government’s resolve to deliver on reforms, it said.
 
 The brokerage said there may be concerns about the pace of economic changes but the government has delivered on policies that include diesel price deregulation, successfully implemented the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana to broaden financial inclusion besides launching social security schemes that provide life insurance, pension and accident cover to greater numbers than before. It also cited the move to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in railway infrastructure, defence and raise the limit on this in insurance.
 
 It also mentioned the Make in India campaign to drum up FDI, the auction-based allocation of mining leases and the attempt to improve the ease of doing business. Apart from lowering the Sensex target last week, HSBC has downgraded India to underweight from overweight.
 
 The brokerage house cited disappointing corporate earnings, the diminished scope for interest rate cuts, concerns about a poor monsoon and the stalling of economic reforms for the downgrade.

Corporation Bank to raise Rs 500 crore from Tier I bonds,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/corporation-bank-to-raise-rs-500-crore-from-tier-i-bonds/articleshow/46017752.cms,m.economictimes.com,Corporation Bank to raise Rs 500 crore from Tier I bonds,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Corporation Bank has launched an issue of Tier I bonds to raise Rs 500 crore for funding its growth plans. 

 The fund would be raised from unsecured subordinated Additional Tier I Basel III compliant non-convertible taxable bonds, a senior official of the bank said. 

 Under the Basel-III norms, AT-1 bonds come with loss absorbency features, meaning that in case of stress, banks can write off such investments or convert them into common equity if approved by the RBI. 

 The bond issue, which opened on January 20, carries a coupon rate of 9.51 per cent have a face value of Rs 10 lakh. 

 The issue would close on February 5 and bonds would be issued on February 6. 

 AT-1 bonds, which qualify as core or equity capital, are one of the means of raising capital by public sector banks that require Rs 2.40 lakh crore by March 2019 to meet global norms on capital adequacy (Basel III). 

 The bonds would be listed on the National Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the bank has bagged MSME Banking Excellence Awards. It has bagged two awards under the categories 'Best MSME Bank Award for Other Bank (Winner)' and 'Best Bank Award (Runner Up)'. 

 The award was received by S R Bansal, Chairman and Managing Director of the bank at the benign hands of Kalraj Mishra, Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Minister."

This would be in addition to such details being disclosed by listed companies through the stock exchange platforms for the benefit of investors.
 
 
Sebi has decided to tighten its corporate disclosure norms for listed companies, including by asking them to disclose board decisions within 30 minutes and details of other 'material' developments within 24 hours.
 
 
""The listed entity shall disclose on its website all events/information which is material and such information shall be hosted for a minimum period of 5 years and thereafter as per the archival policy of the listed entity, as disclosed on its website,"" Sebi said.
 
 
Under the new norms, the listed entities will also be required to regularly update information with respect to 'material' events. This would be in addition to the current requirement of making disclosures at the time of occurrence and after the cessation of the event.
 
 
""In addition to current requirement of making disclosure at the time of occurrence and after the cessation of the event, updation of disclosure on material developments shall also be made on a regular basis till such time the event/ information is resolved/closed with explanations wherever necessary,"" Sebi said.
 
 
The new disclosure requirements are aimed at checking a widespread practice among the Indian companies of selectively leaking the information, including through media and without informing the investors first, for personal gains by promoters and management by way of inflating the valuations in the stock market and before merger and acquisition deals.
 
 
To bring in these changes, which puts the disclosure requirements in India at par with many developed markets, Sebi's board had approved the norms in its meeting yesterday.
 
 
Last year in a discussion paper, Sebi had proposed periodic disclosures on the associated material developments till such time the event is closed.
 
 
Among others, Sebi board also approved amendments wherein companies would have ""to disclose all events or information with respect to subsidiaries which are material for the listed entity"".
 
 
Under the new disclosure guidelines, the listed entity will have to provide specific and adequate reply to queries of stock exchanges with respect to rumours.
 
 
""It may on its own initiative also, confirm or deny any reported information to the stock exchange(s),"" the regulator added."

The company plans to raise more than Rs 1,000-1,500 crore from the bond market to repay a portion of its high-cost loans, two senior bank executives told ET. 

 Money raised through this route will be 150 to 200 bps lower than the bank rates. ""The company has approached banks for a no-objection certificate to raise money through private placement of bonds,"" said an executive. The bank pays an annual interest of 11.5 per cent to its lenders. 

 A DIAL spokesperson said, ""The points raised are speculative in nature and as a policy we do not comment on speculative news."" While banks have lowered their base rate in recent weeks by 25 to 40 basis points, the bond market continues to be a cheaper source for borrowing. For instance, a triple-A-rated corporate can raise money at 8-8.25 per cent from the bond market, lower than State Bank of India's base rate of 9.30 per cent. 

 Even SBI MD B Sriram had said soon after the RBI announced a 50 bps rate cut last week ""the rates in the corporate bond market will be lower than whatever banks will pass on to customers. But the point is only better-rated customers can tap the bond market."" 

 DIAL, which commenced operations in 2010, is a joint venture of the GMR Group that holds a 64 per cent stake through GMR Airports, AAI (26 per cent) and Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (10 per cent). 

 Care upgraded the rating of the company from A to AA recently on the ground that it derives strength from the presence of a structured payment mechanism (SPM) ensuring collection of development fee receipts and servicing of rated debt through designated escrow accounts."

"D-St upset with AAP populist measures, sees no threat to BJP",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/dalal-street-upset-with-aaps-populist-measures-sees-no-serious-threat-to-bjp/articleshow/28450148.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Dalal Street upset with AAP's populist measures, sees no serious threat to BJP","MUMBAI: Stock market investors do not yet regard the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a serious threat to BJP's chances of assuming office for the third time despite the spectacular surge in fortunes for the debutant party following its stunning victory in the Delhi assembly elections.

Traders and brokers ET spoke to criticised AAP's economic policies but said that its insistence on clean candidates untainted by corruption would change the way politics is played out in the country. They were worried that AAP's reliance on freebies and subsidies would harm the country's finances while its anti-corruption plank could potentially slow down the pace of decision making. ""AAP has started on a wrong note, and if its surge continues, it could be a disaster for the economy and stock markets,"" said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares and Securities. ""Markets are wary of AAP. The party must give a clear road map on how and where it will fight corruption.

How is Kejriwal different from other populist governments?"" he wondered. Others were willing to give the newbie outfit a chance. ""The anti-corruption plank by AAP is positive for stock markets to the extent that it would force other political parties to choose candidates with clean record,"" said Samir Arora, fund manager, Helios Capital.

The day AAP won the trust vote, stock markets fell the most in one and a half months. Some dismissed it as profit booking after the Modi rally but others were not so sure. Shares of Reliance Infrastructure, which supplies power to Delhi, have dropped over 3% since January 1 while the Tata Power scrip has fallen 7.7%.

The fall was largely due to an audit of power discoms ordered by Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, and a 50% cut in electricity tariffs for households consuming up to 400 units of power per month in Delhi. Brokers believe that subsidies will worsen finances and create a domino effect with politicians in other states demanding similar doles.

Audit of power discoms in Delhi is likely to increase conflict between government and the private sector and lead to politicians resorting to similar measures as a way of punishing private sector companies.

""AAP's policy moves in Delhi has perplexed and puzzled investors,"" said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO (institutional equities), Ambit Capital, which caters to large foreign institutional investors.

AAP MAY NOT IMPACT BJP Helios Capital, the Singaporebased FII, said that it was not sure about the impact of AAP on the BJP's electoral fortunes. But it credits Kejriwal with raising the bar for selection of political candidates, something that augurs well for financial markets.

Rashesh Shah, Chairman, Edelweiss Financial Services, also lauded AAP's anti-corruption initiative. ""AAP has certain set of socialist policies that markets may not like. But the party has given a positive feel to the markets that it may curtail corruption. It may emerge as a force to reckon with in the next 5-10 years,"" he said Billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprise, often called India's Warren Buffett, said that Narendra Modi will be good for the economy.

Speaking to ET NOW, Jhunjhunwala said that if Modi becomes Prime Minister, it will generate ""a lot of confidence"".

Jhunjhunwala doesn't see regional parties performing ""very well"" in the 2014 elections. ""They have lost vote share in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi. I feel it will be an election where the regional parties will not perform very well. I personally do not see the non-NDA, non-UPA parties getting more 150 seats,"" he said.


	 

Another market expert Ramesh Damani said that despite the prospect of AAP eating into BJP votes in urban areas, the saffron party would still emerge as the singlelargest party in the 2014 general elections.

""Markets are certain that BJP would still emerge as the singlelargest party,"" said Damani.

""AAP's intention seems noble, but it's too early to judge the party. Also, elections are five months away and markets would watch what AAP does in Delhi.""

AAP has already sounded the Lok Sabha poll bugle, announcing that it will put up candidates for the May 2014 polls. Political experts believe that AAP will pose a threat to the BJP in many urban seats and could possibly eat into some of its votes. Shankar Sharma, chief global strategist, First Global, is bearish on the stock markets ahead of the elections.

""Any party to the 'left' or 'right' of 'centre' (Congress) will do poorly in up-coming elections. Markets are entirely positioned on the long side as of now,"" he said.

	ET Now: These are clearly dark days for markets irrespective of the global environment. It has been a one way street for Indian markets what is your sense do you think in the near term Indian markets will continue to underperform global markets?


	Pankaj Pandey: Well, it does look like that there are no triggers from the domestic market perspective. If you look at the current earnings, it is going to be quite dull and boring. 


	What we are expecting is that the top line growth would be about 4.7% compared to about 9.5% growth what we have seen in the past four quarters. 


	Even for Sensex companies excluding oil and gas and banks the top line growth is about 6.5% and bottom line growth of 5.5%. So if you take this growth and compare to above 14 multiples which we are trading. The earnings are definitely quite subdued and which is why we really do not see the markets heading anywhere over the next one year at least in terms of upside. 


	In case the growth does not pick up at least if we do not see any kind of a progressive recovery, so in that sense we are headed slightly lower or probably a much lower levels than the current levels. So in that sense the upside looks capped and probably would depend on the kind of growth which will deliver.


	In terms of triggers, probably in case the crude corrects big time then that could sort of limit the downside or in case if we are going for early elections that would provide some positiveness to the market otherwise for the next eight to 12 months really not expecting much from the markets.


	ET Now: Infy is slated to come out with its earnings on Friday do you think it could turn out to be a market moving event?


	Pankaj Pandey: Well, if you look at from the defensive side what we are expecting largely is about double digit top line and bottom line growth. From the IT if you look at we are expecting Ko1 companies to deliver about 2.6 to 3.9% US dollar revenue growth, and Infy would be about 3.9%. If you exclude the loadstone it will be about 2.6-2.7% kind of a growth. 


	 


	But what would be important is that the Infy guidance would set the tone for the next year and that is where we would look at. Within defensives IT still better. So in that sense it is good. Another positive is that if you look at last quarter the commentary was a lot on how the deal pipeline would shape up and a lot of deals have been signed so in that sense that is also one big positive. 


	So in that sense this year’s guidance would have a crucial role and that the entire IT sector is shaping up well and probably had declines or in case of any kind of crack one should look at these stocks.


	ET Now: But what if Infosys on 12th morning indicates that in the near term there are multiple challenges and they are not confident of FY14 growth, will that spook the market because bear in mind most of the IT stocks at least in one quarter at least the large ones they have appreciated by 20% plus so the majority of the market men either they own IT or they are hiding in IT?


	Pankaj Pandey: Well, you are right. If you look at from year to date the IT index itself has settled about 18% kind of returns and if you look at TCS should be about 22 times and Infy would be about 17 times so in that sense there is no easy money which one can look at. 


	But in case if the company does because of NASSCOM is guiding for about 12% to 14% kind of a growth and if Infy is sort of delivers or sets the tone closer to these range I do not see a big crack in any of the IT stocks. Going forward over the next one year the challenge is more towards safety because rather than return because I do not think we are in a situation where one should be chasing returns big time. 


	It is better to be safe. Last year if you look at TCS actually did not do anything in terms of price performance but then you had this air where it has done  substantially well. Similarly we are expecting that the price crack even in case of the growth turns out to be slightly subdued will not be much, so in that sense I am more seeking towards safety rather than returns at this point in time."

ET Now: A sharp drop has been observed by shares of Eros International Media's NYSE-listed parent after some question raised by the investment bank Wells Fargo. The NSE-listed stock duly corrected on Monday. Have valuations become attractive or would you be wary because of all the negative news flow surrounding the stock?
 
Deven Choksey: On one side, the company has extremely high potential. So, one would like to look at the company with the long-term investment point of view. On the other side, the this particular subject of parent-related issues, for which the company is having some amount of impact, needs to be studied in detail.
 
 Only thereafter one could probably analyse how much impact it could have, if at all, going forward. Till that point of time, I would like to reserve my view on this particular company.

 The Ontario-based company, a unit of the Ruias-controlled Essar Steel, had reported a net loss of $30.65 million in the same quarter last year. 

 ""The gain is attributable to higher shipments coupled with higher selling prices and lower costs,"" Essar Steel Algoma said in a statement. 

 Shipments for the quarter were 6.18 lakh tonnes, up 4.7 per cent as compared to the same period last year. Average realised sales returns improved in the quarter by 15.8 per cent. 

 The company said it had completed a comprehensive recapitalisation and refinancing during the quarter, resulting in a deleveraging of the balance sheet by more than $200 million and an approximate $47 million reduction in annual cash interest expense. 

 ""While we are seeing some near-term softening in market fundamentals we are confident our balanced product mix and low cost position provide a sound foundation for strategic reinvestment in optimisation and growth in the months and years ahead,"" Essar Steel Algoma Chief Executive Officer Kalyan Ghosh said."
ETFs based on MSCI Index set to hit the market soon,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/etfs-based-on-msci-index-set-to-hit-the-market-soon/articleshow/46634809.cms,m.economictimes.com,ETFs based on MSCI Index set to hit the market soon,"NEW DELHI: Two mutual fund houses will soon launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the MSCI India Domestic Index with an eye on tapping inflows from FIIs. Foreign fund managers use MSCI's indices globally and are comfortable with them. Reliance Mutual Fund and Edelweiss Mutual Fund have filed offer documents with Sebi for launching this product. 

 Unlike the Sensex and the Nifty, which have a fixed number of stocks (30 and 50, respectively), the number of stocks in the MSCI India Domestic Index can vary. It stands at 64 currently. The index tries to capture 85% of the total market capitalisation. This is higher than the Nifty, which includes around 70%. ""If you invest in an ETF based on the MSCI India Domestic Index, you will get wider representation of the Indian market,"" says Vikaas M Sachdeva, chief executive officer of Edelweiss Asset Management. 

 The MSCI India Domestic In dex is predominantly a large-cap index with up to 70% in large-cap stocks, another 15% in mid-caps and 15% in small-caps. Fund houses are trying to tap foreign fund managers' familiarity and high degree of comfort with MSCI indices. ""About 80% of the money coming into India is from investors who use MSCI's benchmark indices,"" says Sundeep Sikka, President and chief executive officer of Reliance Asset Management. Adds Sachdeva: ""MSCI is the global gold standard in the benchmark index business. Its indices are followed globally. So an ETF based on MSCI's India index is likely to find many takers."" 

 This ETF will also help foreign investors circumvent the cap on FII ownership in stocks. ""If FIIs take the ETF route, the cap on FII ownership in stocks will not apply since that rule does not hold for mutual fund investments,"" says Sikka. 

 ETFs are a good way to get diversified, high-quality and low-cost exposure to a market or sector. What Should You Do? In the large-cap space, which is widely tracked, it is advisable for retail investors to use ETFs. In the midand small-cap space, however, where the scope for generating alpha is higher, you may opt for actively-managed funds. 

 Examine two parameters before investing in this ETF: expense ratio and tracking error.The average expense ratio of large-cap ETFs is 57 bps currently. Reliance's product will have an expense ratio of 25-30 bps (Edelweiss yet to determine).""Besides a low-expense ratio, ensure that the ETF has a low tracking error. This data will become available only after the product has been in existence for some time,"" says Vishal Dhawan, chief financial planner of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. 

 Tracking error tells you how closely an ETF has been able to replicate the performance of its benchmark index."

Sandeep Wagle: There is a possibility of some kind of a choppiness based on the news. We cannot really make out what the market expectation is in terms of the rate cut. In that sense, I would exercise some caution. But I do not see any pattern that suggests that there can be a one-way slide. Yes, I think it is safe to keep your stop losses a little below 7,900, say, at around 7,880-7,890. If the range is broken, then that will be negative.

 “KPMG has been appointed to run a forensic audit of UCX after it was found prima facie that the latter’s promoter Commex Technology siphoned off funds belonging to the bourse’s other shareholders, to its group companies,” said Ramesh Abhishek, FMC chairman. “One of the main ToRs (terms of reference) of the audit is to trace the funds. It’s too early to say anything more,” he added when asked to elaborate.
 
 Ketan Sheth, MD, Commex Technology, was not available for comment. The findings of a forensic audit can be provided as evidence in court.
 
 Commex Technology, described as being in the business of IT consulting and software on BSE, holds 40% in UCX. The other key shareholders of the bourse include IDBI Bank (10%), REC (16%) and Nabard (16%). The bourse was set up with a paid-up equity capital of Rs 100 crore. The quantum of funds diverted by Sheth’s company from UCX is not clear. REC, Nabard and IDBI Bank will be steering efforts to recover the funds, a government functionary said.
 
 He added that the bourse, which suspended trading last month after having commenced operations a little over a year ago, was unlikely to resume operations, making it potentially the second commex to shut down after Anil Ambani group-anchored Indian Commodity Exchange closed in April this year.
 
 In a filing to the exchange on July 21, Commex Technology said, “…trading activities of Universal Commodity Exchange are suspended temporarily till such time a renewed plan is put in place.”
 
 The bourse, which offered futures trading in oil seeds, pulses and crude oil and natural gas, has been plagued by low volumes and participation ever since it commenced operations in April last year. The imposition of a commodity transaction tax on nonfarm futures in July and the negative fallout towards the commodity market from the Rs 5,600-crore NSEL scam further hit its prospects.
 
 CTT and the fallout from NSEL have affected volumes on the national level commodity bourses comprising metals and energy bourse MCX, farm futures exchange NCDEX, steered by the likes of NSE, LIC and Nabard, Kotak promoted Ace, and Ahmedabad-based plantations bourse NMCE.
 
 FTIL, the promoter of NSEL, currently has 15% in MCX, which it is in the process of selling to Kotak group after having been declared unfit to run the bourse because of the scam at its subsidiary NSEL. It has challenged the FMC ‘unfit’ order of December. MCX has an over 80% market share in the commodity futures market, followed by NCDEX (10-14%). Ace, NMCE and UCX shared the rest."

However, resignation by MCX chief executive officer and managing director Manoj Vaish following disclosure of an audit report by PricewaterhouseCoopers has rendered the exchange headless and Singhal is among the senior most officials of MCX currently.
 
 MCX did not respond to an email. Sources said MCX was yet to get any definitive response from Singhal on whether he was willing to take charge this month.
 
 Decision to ask Singhal to run the show at MCX stems from the fact that he is well versed with regulatory aspect of the exchange business. But Singhal has never handled financial matters at MCX. Vaish was appointed just a couple of months ago after a long selection process and appointment of a new CEO may take a while.
 
 PwC has indicated financial irregularities at MCX and said that its founder promoter Financial Technologies significantly influenced the daily working at the bourse. FT, which holds 26%, stake in MCX has been asked to divest its holding by FMC.
 
 The MCX board that met on May 9 had appointed a four member managing committee of officials including Nilanjan Ghosh, J B Ram, Ajay Puri and Sandeep S. to run the exchange on a daily basis.""Franklin Templeton buys record Rs 16,000-crore government securities in a day"

 The yellow metal took positive cues from the global market amid pick-up in domestic demand. 

 Silver, however, met with resistance at prevailing levels and dropped Rs 450 to Rs 35,950 per kg. 

 Bullion traders said sentiment in gold remained firm after a weak manufacturing report weakened the case for the US Fed to raise interest rates next month, which pushed up gold prices here. 

 Gold also climbed as China's yuan devlauation last week bolstered its safe haven appeal, they said. 

 Globally, gold advanced 0.2 per cent to USD 1,119.88 an ounce in Singapore. 

 Besides, a pick-up in buying by jewellers to meet rising seasonal demand supported the upside, the traders added. 

 The government yesterday raised import tariff on gold to USD 363 per 10 grams and that for silver to USD 499 per kg, taking strong cues from the global market. 

 For the first fortnight of this month, the import tariff of gold and silver stood at USD 354 per 10 grams and USD 498 per kg, respectively. 

 In the national capital, gold of 99.9 per cent and 99.5 per cent purity advanced Rs 90 each to Rs 26,310 and Rs 26,160 per 10 grams, respectively. The precious metal had gained Rs 1,240 in the last eight days. 

 Sovereign, however, continued trade at the previous level of Rs 22,400 per piece of eight grams. 

 On the other hand, silver ready dropped Rs 450 to Rs 35,950 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 155 to Rs 35,745 per kg. Silver coins held steady at Rs 50,000 for purchase and Rs 51,000 for sale of 100 pieces."

 The position has been clarified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in an 'informal guidance' sought by Arch Pharmalabs, the majority shareholder of Avon Organics with a 63.6 per cent stake.
 
 While Arch Pharmalabs is an unlisted entity, Avon is listed on the BSE and a few other bourses.
 
 The Sebi has communicated its position that an open offer would not be triggered for Avon, if promoter group of Arch hike their stake while continuing to remaining in control of Arch, and consequently in control of Avon, after a proposed transaction involving issuance of convertible debentures.
 
 The promoter group of Arch collectively holds 34.27 per cent stake, which would rise to 41.49 per cent pursuant to a proposed transaction, without affecting the shareholding of Avon.
 
 Arch had told Sebi that one of its corporate promoters AMR Investments holds 7.16 per cent stake and is proposing to subscribe to Zero Coupon Fully Convertible Debentures (FCDs) of Arch for an aggregate amount of Rs 150 crore.
 
 These FCDs would be compulsorily convertible into shares within a period of six months from the date of allotment, after which the total promoter holding in Arch would rise to 41.49 per cent.
 
 Arch has, however, said this increase in promoter holding would not change the voting rights that can be exercised in respect of Avon and there will be no change in control as far as Avon is concerned. Arch would continue to hold 63.6 per cent stake in Avon.
 
 Sebi observed that the promoters of AMR are also the co- promoters of Arch, and therefore, an increase in AMR's holding in Arch would not result in change in control of Arch.
 
 An open offer is required to be made for purchase of shares held by public investors in a listed company, if the promoter or some other entity hikes their stake beyond a certain limit or by a specific margin."

 With Unilever's global restructuring during 2005-08, Ramamurthy's role expanded for Unilever Asia, Africa, Middle East, Turkey, Central & Eastern Europe (AACEE), until he moved back to India. 

 The number of Indian managers has been increasing steadily at Unilever over the past few years. More than 200 managers currently serve the company globally in key leadership roles."
House Committee may meet before submitting final report on FCRA Bill,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/house-committee-may-meet-before-submitting-final-report-on-fcra-bill/articleshow/8431581.cms,m.economictimes.com,House Committee may meet before submitting final report on FCRA Bill,"MUMBAI: The department-related standing committee examining the FCRA (Amendment) Bill, 2010, has met three state governments and is expected to have a fourth and probably the last meeting before it submits final report to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. “The standing committee met with three state governments, which were quite supportive of the bill,” said a person with knowledge of the events. 
  
  “The meetings were held in Jaipur , Ahmedabad and Hyderabad and there could be one more before the committee closes its report. The commodity market regulator FMC was present at one of these meetings.” The FCRA amendment bill aims to make it an autonomous body like capital markets regulator , Sebi, giving it powers to recognise or derecognise bourses and collect funds from exchanges registered with it. BC Khatua, chairman of Forward Markets Commission, declined comment while Rajeev Agarwal, secretary, department of consumer affairs, said: “I cannot discuss any issue concerning the standing committee. Their proceedings are confidential.” 
  
  In December, the Lok Sabha Speaker had asked the committee, set up in 2009, to prepare a report on the bill and submit it to the Lok Sabha secretariat within three months. However, the committee has not submitted its report so far, raising doubts among market stakeholders whether it will be able to do so during the monsoon session of the House in July-August . “There is very little chance of the report being submitted in time for the monsoon session, at which time the bill can be taken up and discussed in parliament,” said a broker. Exchange officials privately acknowledge the chances of the bill being taken up during the monsoon session are slim. 
  
  FMC regulates commodity futures trading on five national and 15 regional exchanges and reports to the Union ministry of consumer affairs . Funds are allocated to the regulator from the Consolidated Funds of India and because of staff shortage, the regulator cannot utilise these funds to the fullest. The reference of the bill to the committee surprised many since it was referred to the department-related standing committee in 2006 and the same bill with very minor changes was introduced in Parliament on December 6."
How Sensex moved in the last five RBI policy review meetings,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-sensex-moved-in-the-last-five-rbi-policy-review-meetings/articleshow/39620758.cms,m.economictimes.com,How Sensex moved in the last five RBI policy review meetings,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex did manage to rally and closed in positive terrain in the four out of five Reserve Bank of India’s policy review meetings in the past 11 months.
 
 RBI is scheduled to hold its monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, August 5, 2014, and expectations are that the central bank is unlikely to cut rates.
 
 Ahead of the review, the BSE Sensex closed 242 points or 0.95 per cent higher at 25,723.16 on Monday. It hit a low of 25,531.38 and a high of 25,754.42 in trade today.
 
 The Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to cut key policy rates (repo rate, CRR) at its August 5 monetary policy announcement, according to an ET Now poll. However, 20 per cent of the respondents polled by ET Now expect a 50 bps cut in SLR and 5 per cent expect a 25 bps cut in the SLR rate.
 
 Analysts polled by ET Now expect the rate cut cycle to begin next year. 60 per cent of respondents expect the rate cut cycle to begin from Q4 FY15.
 
 The S&P BSE Sensex rose maximum by 1.7 per cent or 358 points when RBI held its monetary policy meet back in October 2013. The central bank hiked key policy rates by 25 bps each, but maintained its CRR and SLR level at 4 per cent and 23 per cent.
 
 Repo rate, or the rate at which banks borrow funds from RBI, was hiked by 25 bps to 7.75 per cent and reverse repo rate was hiked to 6.75 per cent last year in October and then by another 25 bps earlier in January 2014.
 
 However, after a massive 1.7 per cent rally seen in the benchmark index, the index has given more or less flat returns (refer table).
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 It is important to note that the Reserve Bank of India kept its key policy rates unchanged in the past two policy meets and the markets have more or less ended flat. It will be interesting how the markets will behave on Tuesday, August 5, where expectations are that RBI will maintain 'status-quo' on key rates.
 
 BofA-ML expects status quo on RBI's next policy review. They expect the first cut in December and early 2015 in case of drought. After all, CPI inflation will dip to 5.7 per cent in November and settle at 7 per cent levels thereafter if the monsoon normalizes.
 
 Drought poses a 250 bps risk to CPI inflation in the near term. At the same time, the global investment bank continues to expect the Modi government to focus much more on supply-side measures than the RBI tightening to combat drought."
How to play Nifty options ahead of Bihar elections and win,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-to-play-nifty-options-ahead-of-bihar-elections-and-win/articleshow/49460276.cms,m.economictimes.com,How to play Nifty options ahead of Bihar elections and win,"MUMBAI: Traders with an appetite for risky bets can adopt a strategy involving Nifty options to make a neat profit in the run-up to the Bihar election results in the first week of November, said derivative analysts. They stand a chance of making around two times the initial investment as nervousness around the outcome of the state polls could drive up values of options.
 
 Smart traders are simultaneously buying Nifty call and put options betting that the index could move sharply either side on the basis of the election results. A victory for the NDA government in the crucial state polls will result in a big market rally and a loss in an equally large correction. But, in either scenario, they promise that their clients would gain if they did the long strangle strategy.
 
 ""Rather than taking a directional view, it's better to do a long strangle, since markets can spring unexpected surprises,"" said Rajesh Baheti, MD, Crosseas Capital. The long strangle comprises simultaneous purchase of an 8000 Nifty put and an 8500 Nifty call expiring in November. Purchasing a call is a bet that Nifty would rise and buying a put that it would correct. For purchasing the two options, the trader pays a combined Rs 148 to the options writer. By buying both options, the traders seek to benefit irrespective of the Nifty's direction, based on the exit poll results after November 5 or after results are declared on November 8.
 
 The trader will lose only if the Nifty trades between 8500 and 8000 after the polls. In such a scenario she could very nearly forfeit the price paid to the seller. Their bet is that if the NDA wins, Nifty would rally more than 4.5 per cent from Monday's close to over 8648. If it loses, they expect the index to fall over 5 per cent to less than 7852.
 
 
  
 ""That clients are readying wagers ahead of the Bihar polls is borne out by the rise in trader activity in the 8500 and even 8700 calls for November and the 8000 put for the next month,"" said Navneet Daga, senior derivatives analyst, India Infoline. Indeed, traders' outstanding positions, or open interest (OI) of the 8000 put has risen from 6.8 lakh shares last Thursday to almost 10 lakh shares on Monday, provisional NSE data shows. That of the 8500 call has risen from 8 lakh shares to 10.3 lakh shares over the same period.
 
 However, independent analysts like Aadil Sethna, who earlier headed the derivatives desk at HSBC, the buildup of activity in the 8500 and even the 8700 calls suggests a change in sentiment for the ""better"" with FIIs having infused 3616 crore in shares in the month through Friday after having sold Rs 22,875 worth of equities in the previous two months."

 The Finance Ministry had allowed HUDCO to raise Rs 5,000 crore through bonds in the current financial year, ending March 31. It has raised Rs 4,714 crore so far. 

 ""We are coming out with a public issue of tax free bonds to raise the balance amount of Rs 285.8 crore before end of this fiscal. The tranche-III issue would open from tomorrow,"" a senior HUDCO official said. 

 The basic size of the issue is Rs 75 crore with an option to retain over-subscription up to Rs 285.8 crore. The issue would close on March 19. 

 In August, the company raised Rs 190.8 crore via private placement of bonds with institutional investors. 

 HUDCO raised Rs 2,370 crore from the first tranche of tax- free bonds launched in September. Another Rs 2,153.39 crore was garnered from the second tranche in December. 

 For Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), Corporates and High Networth Individuals (HNIs) applying for bonds more than Rs 10 lakh, the bonds bear a coupon rate of 8.29 per cent per annum for 10 years, 8.73 per cent for 15 years and 8.71 per cent for 20 years. 

 For retail individual investors applying for bonds up to Rs 10 lakh, the coupon rate would be 8.54 per cent for 10 years, 8.98 per cent for 15 Years and 8.96 per cent for 20 years. 

 Hudco will utilise the funds to finance the government's housing and urban infrastructure projects, working capital requirements, augmenting the company's resource base and other operational requirements. 

 During the current fiscal, HUDCO has disbursed loan amount of Rs 5,826 crore. Loan sanctioned during the year amounted to Rs 17,168 crore. 

 The company had posted net profit of Rs 700 crore on revenue of Rs 2,923 crore during the previous financial year. It sanctioned projects worth Rs 23,000 crore and disbursed Rs 6,000 crore in last fiscal."

Ramkumar, who will retire after four years, will continue on the board of directors of the bank where he will oversee the bank’s customer-service and backend functions.  	T Srirang, senior general manager, who is in charge of human resources function will oversee HR operations and directly report to Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank. “I am a disciplined soldier of the bank,” said Ramkumar.  	“Whichever position the captain asks me to play, I will. ICICI Foundation is essentially a HR job. All that I’d be doing is not handle operational issues. Anyway those will pass through the board where I am present.”  	“Mr Kamath was keen that only a senior person and an insider heads the foundation because of the reputational risk to the brand,” said Ramkumar. Ramkumar has been an HR professional for nearly three decades and has run the bank’s human resources department for 13 years.  	ICICI will be investing Rs 250-Rs 300 crore a year in the ICICI Foundation. Its ICICI Academy for Skills will be training thousands of professionals for the banking industry. Set up in 2005 and built on a partnership model, it focuses on vocational training for the youth. Currently, the academy is run in nine centres and ICICI Foundation plans to touch 6,000 people by 2016.  	“Given Ram's passion for this area and his significant contribution in rolling out the ICICI Academy for Skills, our key CSR initiative last year, I can think of no better person for this role,” chief executive Chanda Kochhar said in a statement.  	“He continues to be a member of the Bank's board, overseeing the operations function which is critical to the delivery of our products and services to our customers.”  	Ramkumar will succeed Subrata Mukherji who is retiring this month end from the ICICI Foundation. The former Kabaadi champion is also known as ICICI’s trade union leader because of his outspoken nature. “He is HR head and a trade unionist rolled into one,” an employee had said once.  	Ramkumar was in the news in early 2013 after he publicly called for a probe into the circumstances surrounding the suicide of Tata Steel executive Charudatta Deshpande.  	Deshpande had worked for ICICI Bank in the past and his son was subsequently offered a job at the bank. Ramkumar is also known for his ruthlessness when it comes to firing people.  	After last fiscal year review, he agreed to the firing of 1,500 employees which follows the socalled ‘Bell Curve’ philosophy to reward and fire people.  	“Every organisation should periodically renew itself and let go of people periodically. Otherwise, the organisation will decay,” Ramkumar had told ET last month"

After that, maybe a little bit of Rs 100-200 on the upside is left.

Results - if they are up to the mark, well and good otherwise - can surprise with the stock having built up all the expectation also."

Excerpts: 

ET Now: Post Budget, we have seen a lot of chop and churn. Do you think that the markets have hit a pause button?

Gautam Trivedi: Yes, there is a bit of a pause post the Budget. But this is really a buying opportunity. The area of focus should be midcaps because the largecaps have had a great run. There are still largecaps that will do well, but the real rally that has begun is in the midcaps.

ET Now: So, sectorally, what is it that you are overweight and underweight on?

Gautam Trivedi: We are overweight on financials, cement and construction space. We are also overweight on cap goods space.

ET Now: How material is yesterday’s RBI circular on new infra lending norms. Do you think they will change the life for largecap banks in a meaningful manner?

Gautam Trivedi: We believe that is going to happen and this was long due. The fact is that there has been an ALM issue with these banks for a long time and this has had a significant impact on banks. More importantly, a lot of infrastructure companies can now avail of long duration loans. So, this is a huge positive and it is going to be positive not only for the banks but also for construction companies.

ET Now: For cyclicals, do you think they have taken a back seat or is there still a lot of interest there?

Gautam Trivedi: There is a lot of interest there. Top pick remains UltraTech Cement. The interest is significantly more in the midcap cement space. So, for example, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Cement, Sanghi Cement and even lower down is where we are seeing incremental interest coming into the cement space. We remain overweight on cement space.

ET Now: Soon, the results season will also be in full tilt for those who are expecting anything special or magical from Q1 numbers. Are they in for some disappointment?

Gautam Trivedi: Yes, we may see some disappointment in the cap goods space because this space is forward-looking where we see over the next 12 months the cap good space significantly picking up traction. The last quarter has not really been stellar for the cap goods space. So, we might see some dip there; potentially some dip in IT.

ET Now: Aside of IT, what about defensives and pharma; as well as FMCG?

Gautam Trivedi: The interest level in FMCG in general from investors is very limited at this point and the bias still remains for higher beta stocks and cement financials; but the reality is that with respect to pharma in some sense it is less sensitive to the rupee-dollar equation unlike IT.

ET Now: The Street is divided on how should one approach banks. Should one bet on private banks which are a proxy to Indian economy or should one continue to bet on PSBs?

Gautam Trivedi: It is a mix of both because the interest levels in PSUs currently is a lot higher because even after the rally the discount to private banks remains significant and at the same time you are looking at few banks like may be an HDFC or an Axis where foreign ownership is nearing its limit. The focus among the privates is on ICICI Bank. Yes Bank already has had an offering that was very successfully managed.

ET Now: Is there more accumulation happening in oil marketing companies? Of course, we carried a story few days back which came in the papers as well. Economic Times essentially talking about complete deregulation of diesel by the end of the year. Is there still more headroom for these stocks?

Gautam Trivedi: Yes, significantly there are a couple of things for oil marketing companies. There was a talk about starting to phase out, at least the LPG, and kerosene subsidy. As the subsidies keep going down incrementally, it is only positive for OMCs.

Second point is that if you look at the absolute consumption of oil in this country we are still way far down versus other emerging markets like China. For example, there the consumption per capita of oil and oil products is significantly higher than it is for India.

India adds about over 2 million passenger cars every year and over 10-11 million two-wheelers every year. The incremental demand that will come for oil and oil products from this penetration is going to be a significant factor to keep in mind. Besides, also should be noted the pure subsidy reduction that is happening.

ET Now: Do you think IDFC will be the single biggest beneficiary of the new RBI norms because IDFC is all about infra lending?

Gautam Trivedi: I would not single out IDFC; but the fact is that the move will impact all because they are increasingly getting active in the infra space. Given what the government’s ambitions are, this is going to benefit everybody. But yes, IDFC, at least for now, appears to be a large beneficiary of the move.

ET Now: Now that the two key big market-moving events for this calendar year are behind us - election and Budget - what could be the next big trigger which markets would like to latch onto?

Gautam Trivedi: Budget in some sense was not that big an event. People were waiting to see what the government would actually do because the government had been in power all of 45 days and to expect anything significant out of this Budget was grossly ambitious.

The big event really in the next seven months, which is the next Budget in 2015 ... that is really going to be a big event; but between now and then, you will have at least two more earnings seasons which the market will focus on and that really will be important to see if the election is resulting in a significant uptick in consumption, which will obviously benefit the entire economy.

ET Now: You mentioned that you are bullish on oil marketing stocks because you expect that this subsidy burden will come off significantly. How about ONGC because if subsidy burden comes off significantly, ONGC clearly will be the biggest beneficiary?

Gautam Trivedi: Every time ONGC has been coming close to getting a windfall profit, there is either an indirect taxation or something happens by which the government ends up taking some of the thunder away from ONGC. We like the stock, we have a buy on the stock and we are waiting eagerly to know what the government’s policy is going to be with respect to gas prices.


	 
ET Now: What is the call on Reliance?

Gautam Trivedi: We like Reliance, terrific company, phenomenal execution. It's the biggest cash flow among all the companies in India. Having said that, the market and investors are looking for guidance on what the production is going to be from KG-D6 and hopefully as the government said in the next three months they will solve the gas pricing issue.

So, that is something which we should be putting behind us. It has been going on forever and is clearly hurting the company’s stock price. Finalisation of the gas price hike, one; and two, the absolute production volume increasing, would be the two big triggers for Reliance to move ahead from current levels.

ET Now: What is your take on midcap IT because on a relative basis, midcap IT stocks are still cheap?

Gautam Trivedi: That has always been the case. We honestly prefer largecaps to midcap IT stocks.

ET Now: In the largecap IT space, my understanding is that as a house you are bullish on Infosys. My follow-up question is why Infosys.

Gautam Trivedi: There is a lot of hope riding on Sikka and the fact is that with Mr Murthy and son stepping down, they have given him a free hand and there are a lot of expectations from this company now.

ET Now: What are your top-three ideas from the midcap space? Where are you advising your clients to allocate disproportionate amount of money?

Gautam Trivedi: Our top pick would be Crompton Greaves. We like that a lot. Our target price on that stock is now 235.

Second top pick would be Finolex Industries; great management. The stock has already tripled in the past 24 months but we see significantly more upside.

Our third top pick is a very interesting company - Firstsource.


	 
ET Now: Anything from media that you like?

Gautam Trivedi: In the media space, Dish TV at lower levels definitely looks interesting.

ET Now: You mentioned that you like Firstsource. What is so unique about Firstsource because this is one IT company which still has a debt on its balance sheet. What is the thinking behind liking a company which has a debt on its balance sheet?

Gautam Trivedi: That is exactly why we like it because the company is on track to repay that debt. So, the question really was will this company be able to generate enough cash flow to actually start paring down its debt. They have successfully demonstrated that over the past few quarters that debt reduction is a priority and that is the reason the stock actually has been going up.

ET Now: Bharat Forge in the auto ancillary pack has been getting some things right. It's a leader from that segment. Do you like it? Is that also a part of your conviction list?

Gautam Trivedi: Bharat Forge is something which we have not focused on, but otherwise intrinsically I do not think there is any issue with the company. It is a good way to play both the export and the domestic auto story; so we like the stock.

ET Now: What is your view on autos right now? I do not think we have taken your view on that especially between four-wheelers and two-wheelers?

Gautam Trivedi: Our preference at this point, given the erraticness of Monsoon, would be on four-wheelers, that is Maruti. We believe the stock can go way beyond 3000 ... On the two-wheelers, there is obviously a concern whether rural incomes will actually rise given the Monsoon has been sketchy and may not necessarily make up for the last few weeks of shortfall ... hence, our focus will remain on four-wheelers. Also, within the auto pack we like Ashok Leyland.

ET Now: Is there going to be more focus from the commercial vehicle segment which is more linked to a reviving economy?

Gautam Trivedi: Our target price on Ashok Leyland is probably one of the highest at Rs 45; and we believe that the stock will do significantly better. Like FirstSource, Ashok Leyland is looking at significantly paring debt. Their recent QIP was very successfully received and we like that story as well.

ET Now: Any specific reason why you like Hinduja Group stocks - Ashok Leyland, IndusInd Bank?

Gautam Trivedi: You forgot to mention Gulf Oil. The group has got a significant rerating given how IndusInd Bank has done. Of course, we have seen a change in management ... You are seeing new management and a new focus in Ashok Leyland. The stock tripled after hitting the bottom. Gulf Oil is an interesting company because the group has gone ahead and split the company into two. They have some great assets.

ET Now: Housing finance companies are evergreen irrespective of when you buy. If you bought housing finance companies you have always made money. What is your take on housing finance companies?

Gautam Trivedi: I firmly agree with what you are saying because most of these companies have low NPLs because the asset is the house itself. I do not see any downside. The other names that are out there are CanFin Homes for example. It has been a great story as well. The stock has done extremely well over the last 12 to 18 months. Gruh Finance continues to remain one of the most expensive financial stocks in the country. These stocks are basically buy and hold. I do not think anybody should try and trade them."

Investors should be wary of cyclicals even if Narendra Modi wins,negative,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/the-hurdle-is-high-for-markets-even-if-modi-wins-again/articleshow/68806306.cms,m.economictimes.com,The hurdle is high for markets even if Modi wins again,"By Adam Haigh and Selcuk Gokoluk
The bar is high for Asia’s most-popular destination of 2019 for overseas money even if Prime Minister Narendra Modi wins a second term in elections starting Thursday.

A survey of 21 global funds and strategists show most expect him to return, an outcome that may be baked into asset prices. With valuations already high, the disappointment if he fails to get a majority, needs to form another coalition -- or loses the poll -- may deflate the rally that’s made India the first among markets valued at more than a $1 trillion to hit a new peak this year.

“Numbers will matter as well as the degree to which he needs others to form a majority government,” said Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging markets strategist in the Hague at NN Investment Partners, which oversees about 246 billion euros ($277 billion). A Modi victory “should be good for markets, but the markets have probably priced it in,” he said.

 
Bloomberg 
Indian stocks have had an amazing run since Modi came to power in 2014 -- the Sensex rose about four times as much as the MSCI Asia-Pacific, so the stakes are high. Shares trade at a 38 percent premium over Asia-Pacific peers as foreigners bought more than $7 billion of local shares so far this year, the most in the region.

Sentiment is also being aided by the Reserve Bank of India, which delivered the second rate cut of the year last week, and bullish views from brokerages including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Even some local money managers who have been cautious are turning bullish, though domestic institutional investors yanked cash out ahead of the polls.

Modi’s strong response to the border situation with Pakistan appears to have boosted his popularity. On top of that, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is leading in opinion polls, on Monday pledged to spend $1.44 trillion on infrastructure to boost the economy, in a bid to match its main rival’s populist promises. Election results are due on May 23.

Global funds’ optimism is not predicated on Modi victory alone as they say the underlying growth momentum and the broad political commitment to economic reforms will stay even if the opposition wrests power.

Investors say that Modi -- or whoever wins power -- must use the mandate to create jobs and fix the plumbing of the financial system. The much vaunted consumption engine is sputtering amid the aftershocks of the crisis in the shadow banking sector.

“While the government has produced reforms, I’d be looking for initiatives such as improving infrastructure and financial sector reforms,” said Claudia Calich, an emerging-market bond fund manager at M&G Ltd. in London.


Mixed BagModi’s tenure has been a mix of big reforms including the introduction of a unified tax system, insolvency and bankruptcy rules and demonetization that struck at the heart of a largely cash-based economy but temporarily disrupted economic growth.

India’s equity valuation premium over its Asian peers will shrink if voters deliver an upset victory for the opposition.

“If the results are not constructive for investors, we will require a higher rate of return from our Indian positions,” said Ghadir Cooper, who manages $11.7 billion as global head of equities at Barings. “The government remains committed to structural reforms that would underpin the excitement we have in the earnings potential. If there’s a change in administration, we’ll look to see whether we require a higher rate of return.”

Here’s a snapshot of other views from the survey:


Rob Marshall-Lee, head of Emerging and Asian Pacific equities at Newton Investment Management
This has been one of, if not the, best governments in the world in the last few years. The Modi government has put in place numerous economic reforms, which will have positive consequences over a number of years to come. It is unlikely that a new government would fully unwind them.


Kieran Curtis, fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investment
India has had a good run, so we are probably not likely to add. A loss by the BJP would require more analysis to see how much it changes the investment case, particularly since levels would likely be less attractive to sell at.
Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Group Plc in London

We might take some profits on a significant relief rally, but we are not a hedge fund and would still maintain a position if the outlook remains broadly unchanged. There are signs that the Modi government is beginning to use some of the same bad tricks as the former Congress administration. For example, putting doves on the central bank and recapitalizing airlines with state banks.


Kiran Nandra, senior product specialist, emerging markets at Pictet Asset Management
An unclear outcome might cause jitters in the market but we would treat temporary sell-offs as a buying opportunity. The long-term investment opportunity in India remains firmly in place, and we expect good-quality companies to continue to grow regardless of different election outcomes.


Eric Anderson, emerging-markets portfolio manager at Milltrust International
We are underweight India due to expensive valuations. On the positive side, the nation does have accommodative monetary conditions and a growth rate that is trending above the policy rate and inflation, all of which are positive for equities. I can certainly see us adding to our India exposure this year."
IPFs of commodity bourses not to have FMC official as trustee,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/ipfs-of-commodity-bourses-not-to-have-fmc-official-as-trustee/articleshow/46340742.cms,m.economictimes.com,IPFs of commodity bourses not to have FMC official as trustee,"NEW DELHI: With the Investor Protection Fund (IPF) of commodity bourses functioning smoothly, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has decided not to nominate its official as trustee to the IPF. 

 An IPF, registered as a trust, is created to protect the interests of clients of trading members of an exchange who may have been declared defaulters or expelled under the provisions of the bourse. 

 ""Now, over the years the IPF has been functioning smoothly. It is therefore felt that nomination of an official of FMC as a trustee in IPF is no longer required. Therefore, the Commission has decided to amend the guidelines,"" commodity markets regulator FMC said in a recent circular. 

 As per the amended guidelines, the IPF trust would consist of two eminent persons, one independent Director on the Board of the exchange and the exchange Managing Director and CEO. 

 The names of eminent persons and an independent Director will be suggested by the exchanges and approved by the regulator. 

 The FMC has made further amendment to delete the requirement of IPF Trust Deed. 

 The exchanges have been asked to take note of the amendments and accordingly make the necessary changes in rules, regulations and bye-laws of the exchange. 

 The IPF was constituted to protect investors' funds from default risk of members of the exchanges as investors play a very useful role in commodity derivative market and their interest needs to be protected, said the FMC circular. 

 Currently, there are four national and six regional level exchanges in the country.

 NSEL Investors Forum represents 13,000 investors, whose money is stuck following the payment crisis at the National Spot Exchange Ltd, a subsidiary of FTIL. 

 ""Shah's arrest was long over due. His arrest will scare defaulters and force them to pay the money at the earliest,"" Forum Secretary Arun Dalmia told PTI. 

 The entire money would have been recovered if was Shah was arrested in August last year. The payment default would have been only Rs 2,000 crore had the government taken action way back in 2012, he added. 

 With Shah's arrest, the total number of arrests in the scam has gone up to seven. 

 Shah's FTIL owns NSEL, a spot commodities exchange that is under investigation by the police and regulators after it struggled to settle outstanding contracts worth Rs 5,600 crore. 

 NSEL's payment troubles began after it was ordered by the government in July last year to suspend spot trade in most of its contracts due to suspected trading violations. 

 The exchange could not settle the outstanding trades, sparking investigations by the police and regulators to find out whether the exchange had defrauded traders by not enforcing rules requiring sufficient collateral to be set aside. 

 FTIL blamed NSEL executives and the trading parties for the default. There were 24 members who defaulted payment to about 13,000 investors. 

 FTIL owns 99.9 per cent of NSEL, which has suspended all trading operations since the payment shortages."

What is the call now on JustDial?  

 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay: I agree with you. In fact last three months I have been saying that the valuation looks little too high and that is exactly what is happening. 

 In fact last week also I mentioned that probably if somebody is holding, they should quickly exit. 

 There were lots of rumours in this counter of some global tie up, that names like Google were being talked about but if that something happens, then of course it is a different story, otherwise the valuation even now at a level of around 1000 looks little rich to me and another 10-15 per cent correction will not be out of the way."

Mayuresh Joshi: Clearly as a disclaimer, we do not cover the stock but if you look at the industry fundamentals,the cuts in ATF prices should aid margin expansion. The fuel purchases made by many airlines companies during the first half should come down with ATF prices cut by 11%. 

 If one looks at the macro picture, cash flow is not strong for the entire sector including SpiceJet, Jet Airways and many other airlines. Companies are operating in a negative net worth environment and the regulatory concerns in terms of costs both in terms of parking fees, parking base, the infrastructure cost will be sorted out but they will come in the next couple of years. 

 Though margin expansion is evident probably in Q3-Q4 if crude stays this way, the probable impact on a long term basis is as very well drawn out. The cash flows improvement would be based on a lot of multitude factors and macro development as well and improvement in macro factors as well. So with all these factors probably, we are still maintaining a neutral stance on the entire aviation space."

ET Now: Do you believe that we will probably make a dash towards 5500? 

 Ashwani Gujral: I think that seems possible and now laggard groups could add to the market like banking also picking up at some point. So, a closing above 5430 is positive. The market is scaling up and what good is that it has these declines intraday from where it shows recoveries and chances are that Fed event should also go in the market's favour. Momentum should pick up from here, participation should increase beyond those two-three sectors like tech, pharma, FMCG and once the participation gets broader then the gains will look more sustainable. And we should, at some point, probably retest 5600 in the next few weeks. 

 
ET Now: What is the call on markets right now and what are your stock recommendations? 

 Ashwani Gujral: I am convinced that we will go on printing money till everybody goes bankrupt and paper money has no value. So German Court ruling was expected. It is also expected that the FED would do things that it needs to do. It is only in this country that we keep delaying things. So, chances are that FED will also come with a QE that is expected by the market. Hence, we should be looking at a pretty benign liquidity situation which will help the markets in moving higher. 

 Overall, as long as we stay above 5320-5330, broadly yesterday’s high, we should be fine because that is also the point where a downward sloping trend line support is there, a trend line which comes from about 6300 through 5600. So overall in the longer term charts, the market seems to be consolidating at lower levels and slowly moving up. 

 In terms of individual stocks, MTNL has restarted its move. So this is now a buy with a stop of about 37, target of about 45. Tata Motors DVR is a buy with a stop of about 152, target of 167 and Tech Mahindra is a buy with a stop of about 900, target of 975."

The unexpected happened in January, contrary to the consensus view, markets sold off and the Sensex declined over 3 per cent from 21,170.68 to 20,513.85. The decline was attributed to the crack in the emerging market currencies of Turkey, Argentina and South Africa.

The main reason for the pressure on these currencies was the unwinding of the US Federal Reserves’ quantitative easing program. Local factors in these countries – economical and political exacerbated the fall and once again the world focused on the weaknesses of these economies.

Going forward as well, concerns over slowdown in China, further tapering by the US Federal Reserve are few global headwinds which are likely to keep our markets on the edge in the year 2014, but nonetheless we are in much better position than other emerging markets, say analysts.

Back home, uncertainty around general elections due in May, slowdown in domestic demand and muted quarterly results are few which may cap gains.

“On the global front, China remains a big worry for investors and therefore things like metals, etc, will continue have a bit of a problem especially in terms of the finished product,” said Anand Tandon, Independent Analyst, in an interview with ET Now.

“The fact that we have just announced a new pay commission is also a cause of worry. Every time we have a pay commission which is actually implemented the prices tend to shoot, because lot of money comes into the system without necessarily activity,” he added.

I do not think we are out of the woods anytime soon, but the very near term - we are like in the middle of the calm before the storm perhaps, concludes Tandon.

However, even though foreign institutional investors or FIIs have turned net sellers in Indian markets, but the fall in the market is less severe as compared to other emerging markets.

One of the possible reasons explained by analysts is that fact that we (India) have been able straighten out our macro situations and with recent commentary by Finance Minster, P Chidambaram infused further positive sentiment.

India’s fiscal position remains weak and a cut in spending to meet the fiscal deficit estimate this year will probably hurt growth, Moody’s Investors Service said earlier in this week.

The government on Monday this week said the fiscal deficit for the current financial year will be contained at 4.6% of GDP. The fiscal deficit, which is the gap between expenditure and revenue, was 4.9% of GDP in the previous financial year.

He further added that India's current account deficit (CAD) will be contained at $45 billion this financial year, well below the record high level of 2012-13.

	 
However, some experts are of the view even though we allowed currency to collapse but we are still not out of the woods as the deficit in totality is actually much greater than some of the countries which were facing huge FII outflows largely on account of their own problems.

“India is pushing its luck, if you add up the current account deficit plus the budget deficit of India you get a number which is far more severe than Brazil, far more severe than Turkey, far more severe than Argentina and far more severe than Thailand,” says Paul Schulte, CEO & Chairman, Schulte Research in an interview with ET Now.

“The Indian government probably was smart to allow the currency to sort of collapse because that was the way to let all the pressure out of the system. India has just been letting the currency go which is probably a smart thing to do but that is going to have very profound implications this year in the way of very high inflation,” he cautioned investors.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) which were the backbone of the rally that we witnessed in the calendar year 2013 became net sellers in the year 2014. Last year, foreigners brought in $20 billion and this year FII’s have actually net sellers of odd $250 million as per recent data.

No doubt we (India) were amongst the least affected, but FII flows did turn negative in January. There were a few nervous moments as the Sensex briefly pierced its 200-day moving average of 19,986 trading below the psychologically important 20,000 mark.

More importantly, as we speak, we are still not clear whether this latest round of emerging market turmoil has subsided. There is every likelihood that markets could trend lower as international investors (read FIIs) get more jittery.

India's growth ""remains trapped in a low range"" and the country is likely to see a GDP growth of 4.9 per cent in FY14, Chidambaram said earlier in this week. He further announced that GDP growth rate in Q3 and Q4 of 2013-14 will be at least 5.2 per cent.

However, experts are of the view that even though the figures look promising but if global growth falters Indian will get affected.

Tanvee Gupta Jain, India Economist, Macquarie Securities is of the view that if the global growth were to falter in the second half, India will get affected. Right now, in our 2014 outlook on India, we expect a 5.4% growth versus 4.9%, which we saw in the last financial year.

“The main driver for growth is external demand, whereas we expect the resumption in investment to stabilise at lower levels this year,” added Gupta.

Gupta is of the view that if the global growth is not looking as optimistic as it were in the outlook six months back, then definitely the risks are skewed to the downside on my 5.4% growth estimate.

Although analysts remain optimistic for the year, realistically there are more challenges than they have earlier envisaged.

	 
Slow down in domestic demand, extension of the tight money policy, limited gains for exporter from a depreciating currency (going forward) and the dangling sword of a hung parliament are some of the factors which may weigh down on market sentiment.

“Keeping this in mind we advise investors to back off a bit. It does appear that markets will remain range bound over the next few weeks / months with the previous Sensex high of 21,483 being a strong resistance level to breach,” says Dipan Mehta, Member BSE & NSE.

“Election results and formation of a new government are a few months away and even after that, time will have to be given to the new government to bring about change,” he added."

If you want to bet, 95% who made the last 5% that can be your choice but if you see the last three to four sessions, you have moved vertically from 6650 to 7150 so whichever way you look at it, at least some sort of sideways move should start whatever election results you get before the next upside starts. It is very difficult that you have another 10% and that will surely lead to some kind of major fall. So, we have reached intermediate top and one that will take some time in terms of crossing on the upside."
Marks and Spencer Reliance India appoints Venu Nair as managing director,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/marks-and-spencer-reliance-india-appoints-venu-nair-as-managing-director/articleshow/12109114.cms,m.economictimes.com,Marks and Spencer Reliance India appoints Venu Nair as managing director,"BANGALORE: Apparel and home products retailer Marks and Spencer has appointed Venu Nair as head of its India operations, replacing CEO Martin Jones who is moving back to the parent company. 

 Nair takes charge as managing director, the London-headquartered company said. Sources said Jones was moving back for personal reasons. Nair was head of sourcing for the £9.7-billion British retailer in South Asia and director of buying operations for India. 

 M&S operates in India through Marks & Spencer Reliance India, a joint venture with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, selling clothes and home decor but not its food products. It has 24 outlets across the country. """"Unlike an expatriate, Nair would have stronger understanding of the Indian market and his being involved directly in sourcing will play to his strength,"""" said a senior executive of a rival firm. M&S has been to work towards sourcing 70% of its merchandise from India and Jones had been driving this change. 

 """"While other international companies look at India as an interesting and emerging market, M&S clearly specifies India as a market of importance,"""" said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of management consultancy Third Eyesight. 

 In recent years, the London-headquartered company has tweaked prices in India to shed its image of being a premium retailer selling imported products. It was able to do this by sharing margins of local sourcing with consumers. 

 The retailer increased local sourcing from 38% in 2010 to 50% in 2011 and almost tripled stores sizes to about 20,000 sq ft. 

 """"The true potential of the brand is coming to life in the larger stores. Lingerie as well as women's wear categories have down well. But the brand could expand faster,"""" said another executive on condition of anonymity. 

 M&S plans to increase the number of stores in India to 50 by 2013. 

 The retailer entered India in 2000 through a franchisee agreement with Planet Retail. In 2008, it demonstrated its plan to get more aggressive by stitching a 51:49 joint venture with Reliance Industries. At that time, Marks and Spencer Reliance India had outlined an initial investment of 29 million pounds. 

 The joint venture's first chief executive, Mark Ashman, too, had moved back in two years time to become M&S's regional managing director for Europe and the Middle East. Ashman later joined K Raheja Group-promoted HyperCity Retail as chief executive."

ET Now: What is your call on Century Textiles? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: Century Textiles has been in a sideways consolidation for a long time. Today, it has broken out of the 350 zone. There are chances it will move closer towards 400 and a fresh bull move has started. This is because a key trend line has been violated on the upside down trending line, which came all the way from 575. 

 So, chances are that Century Textiles is starting a bull move and this could have a pretty fancy medium term targets. 450-460 over a period of time is not unlikely."
"Midcap mantra: Gujarat Flourochemicals on a roll, to post solid earnings",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/midcap-mantra-gujarat-flourochemicals-on-a-roll-to-post-solid-earnings/articleshow/44978193.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Midcap mantra: Gujarat Flourochemicals on a roll, to post solid earnings","The Inox Group’s flagship company Gujarat Flourochemicals (GFL) has strongly gained in valuations of late as its future outlook has turned bright. The company’s four business verticals – chemicals, wind power, wind turbines and entertainment – are expected to grow rapidly supported by margin expansion. The company is expected to post robust earnings growth in coming quarters fuelled by past capital investments and strong cash flows.
 
 A proposed initial public offer (IPO) of its subsidiary Inox Wind should further add to its valuations. Traditionally a refrigerant gas manufacturer, GFL was forced to innovate when these ozone-depleting gases had to be phased out. As a result, the company entered manufacturing of a specialty high-value resin Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (PTFE) – originally invented by Du Pont and popularised globally by its brand name ‘Teflon’ – which is produced using the refrigerant gas. 
 ""PTFE is a specialty polymer with unique properties and hence, used in a variety of industries. Western players are not expanding while Chinese manufacturers have restricted number of grades of this product, which offers a significant growth opportunity for us,"" said Vivek Jain, managing director, GFL. After setting up a 16,000 tonne per annum capacity to manufacture PTFE in 2008, the company was able to use only half of it till FY14 as it was developing different product grades and seeking customer approvals.
 
 ""For us, the product development cycle is over and customer approvals have started coming, which is resulting in higher PTFE sales,” said Jain. “By end June 2015 quarter, our PTFE capacity utilisation should reach 100%,"" he added. PTFE contributed half of the company’s Rs 1,185 crore revenue from the chemical business in FY14.
 
 The company’s subsidiary Inox Wind, which was set up in 2010 to manufacture wind mills suitable to Indian conditions, is also finding aspurt in sales and orders. Its revenue shot up 90% to .`594 crore in the half year ended September 2014, and net profit grew 3-fold to Rs 56.5 crore.
 
 The company, which executed 330 mw of projects in FY14, is carrying an order book of 1 gw of projects and is planning to launch an IPO to fund expansion. GFL’s other subsidiary Inox Renewables, which runs 213 mw windmill farms, posted 2.4 times jump in FY14 net profit at Rs 157 crore on a turnover of Rs 175 crore. The business will be an annuity earning business, with no incremental investments from GFL. GFL’s capex cycle is almost over as it recently commissioned a 40,000 tonne per annum plant to produce HCFC refrigerant gas to feed its PTFE unit.
 
 The future capex will be mostly on debottlenecking. With strong cash flows and expected revenue growth, the company can soon wipe off net debt from its balance sheet."
Mumbai HC to hear govt's case against FTIL board on Wednesday,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mumbai-hc-to-hear-govts-case-against-ftil-board-on-wednesday/articleshow/46441306.cms,m.economictimes.com,Mumbai HC to hear govt's case against FTIL board on Wednesday,"MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court (HC) has said it would on Wednesday hear the government's arguments to a motion filed by Financial Technologies (FTIL) against the ministry of corporate affairs moving the Company Law Board (CLB) to supersede its board. In the interim, the government will have to hold back submission on its petition to CLB until after the Bombay HC hears the matter on Wednesday. 

 In its petition to the CLB, the ministry has sought ad interim relief to, among others, restrain all the current directors of FTIL from acting as directors or holding any other office in the company and to restrain them from creating third party rights on any propertiesassets owned by it. Further, CLB should allow the government to appoint nominee directors in place of the existing directors on FTIL. 

 FTIL's shares ended up almost 20 per cent to Rs 214.4 on Monday.The government petition was to be heard by CLB, Delhi on Tuesday. Now, before moving the CLB, the government will place its stand for petitioning the board before the HC on Wednesday. 

 In October last year, the government passed a draft order to amalgamate scam-hit NSEL with its holding company FTIL, which the latter challenged in the HC. The HC on February 4 vacated its status quo order in respect of the draft order with the rider that the government pass a final or der within two months after hearing objections of all the affected parties ­ FTIL and its shareholders, etc. The HC also restrained the government from implementing the final order for two weeks thereafter to allow FTIL to move the court. 

 FTIL's argument in court on Monday was that before the government passed a final order under Section 396, replacing its board would render any objection by the company to the same infructuous. Its petition has challenged the government's invocation of Section 396 for merging its subsidiary, scam-hit NSEL, with itself in public interest on the ground that the holding company would be rendered without an identity and that interests of its shareholders would be hurt. 

 But the government has blamed FTIL squarely for the Rs 5,600-crore loss caused to Rs 13,000 investors who traded on its subsidiary NSEL, in which it held 99.99 per cent, and had common directors and key management personnel. 

 The ministry has cited media reports to the effect that FTIL would ""hive off its most popular automated trading software Odin into a separate business unit for selling it to prospective bidders."" 

 Moves like this, it argues, would defeat the amalgamation exercise aimed at speeding up recovery efforts to NSEL's distressed investors."

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: US FDA has been closely monitoring the domestic pharma companies. Does that make you bit wary of the entire pharma sector?  

 
Dipan Mehta: Yes. The way the US FDA is going about with its inspections, we will have to be extremely stock specific within the sector and it is going to be a bit challenging. But at the end of the day, the kind of growth rates that these companies have demonstrated and the kind of opportunity which is there in the global markets, there is considerable scope for the Indian pharma industry to increase its market share overseas. 

 Keeping all this in mind, this is a sector which will always find lot of favour with investors and of course, this risk of US FDA inspections as well as inspections by other authorities does remain. 

 One has to be a bit careful about the stock selection and you could also take a more kind of holistic approach and buy a basket of pharma companies or pharma mutual fund. But there is no denying that investors require to have exposure to pharma sector stocks just on account of the kind of growth rates that this industry has been experiencing over the past two-three years and the opportunity going forward.

ET Now: What is the house call right now on the PSU banking stocks? Are you advising people to actually bottom fish or were the numbers just so terrible that you just wait out for the pain to ease and get reported before you start buying them again? 

 
Mayuresh Joshi: Clearly numbers have been dismal. You take the case of Bank of Baroda, where a lot of analysts did not expect the restructuring pipeline the way it was. Clearly the numbers have shaken up the entire PSU lot and I do not perceive probably the numbers getting better. So our take was that Q3 and Q4 will be tepid for PSU bank earnings and only the interest rate cycle cut will probably have a structural shift in terms of bank's balance sheet, specifically on the PSU side. Again a lot of the midcap PSU banks are starved of capital.
 
 So with the government probably taking some initiative in cutting down their stake, you might have some push through probably happening in terms of capital being raised by these guys but the performance has been poor but our take is probably that if one carries on staggered investments in these banks over the next two to three months or three to four months, then probably money can be made over the next couple of years but the result probably would be on the weaker side even in Q4."

Pre-market: Nifty seen opening flat on first trading day of 2014,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/pre-market-nifty-seen-opening-flat-on-first-trading-day-of-2014/articleshow/28213680.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pre-market: Nifty seen opening flat on first trading day of 2014,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on the first trading day on 2014 in the absence of any major global cues. Tracking the muted momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial level of 6300 levels in trade on Wednesday. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 9 points higher at 6360, indicating a flat opening on the domestic market. 

 The benchmark indices ended the calendar year 2013 on a positive note as investors rushed to export oriented defensives such as technology and healthcare sectors following sharp deterioration in rupee against the US dollar. 

 The Indian benchmark, S&P BSE Sensex Index rose around 9 per cent in 2013, touching an all-time high in early December, while the Nifty rose 7 per cent in 2013. 

 For the past 3 trading sessions, Nifty is unable to surpass 6350 hence the breakout will be materialized above 6350 and fresh rally will be seen. 

 ""The initial target for Nifty is placed at 6450 which is likely in next few trading sessions. A stop loss is still maintained at 6170 levels for all long trading positions,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 ""Short term traders can initiate long position in Nifty Futures above 6400 with the stop loss of 6350 & target 6500,"" added the report. 

 The brokerage firm is of the view that in case, Nifty breaches 6170 mark, a sharp sell-off till 6020 will be seen as per chartical indication. 

 Overnight, U.S. Stocks closed out their best year in more than 15, with major indexes advancing throughout 2013 on the back of the Federal Reserve's massive stimulus program and sharp turnaround seen in the economy. 

 The S&P 500 rose 29.6 percent over the year, its best annual performance since 1997, while the Dow climbed 26.5 percent in its best year since 1995. The Nasdaq jumped 38.3 percent, its best year since 2009, Reuters reported. 

 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 72.37 points, or 0.44 percent, to end at 16,576.66. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 7.29 points, or 0.40 percent, to finish at 1,848.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 22.39 points, or 0.54 percent, to close at 4,176.59.

 The finance ministry, according to a senior official, has suggested to the Department of Public Enterprises that listing clause be made mandatory under the new MoU norms for public sector units (PSUs).
 
 Out of about 160 profit-making CPSEs, only 43 are listed on the BSE. The major unlisted profit making CPSEs include RINL, ONGC Videsh, Coal India subsidiaries, Airports Authority of India and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.
 
 ""The disinvestment department has suggested to the DPE that when they sign the MoUs with PSUs, listing plans should be made mandatory,"" a senior finance ministry official told PTI.
 
 DPE comes out with guidelines for the Memorandum of Understanding every fiscal. Under the existing norms, the central PSUs have to list out their objective, commitments, performance assessment targets, financial and non financial targets to the government.
 
 MoUs are signed between PSUs and their administrative ministries/departments and is facilitated by DPE. The subsidiaries are required to sign MoUs with the parent firms.
 
 The listing, according to another official, would help to unlock the true value of a profit making PSU and give public ownership in the company.
 
 ""Listing of a PSU helps to increase corporate governance by way of timely disclosures, greater professionalism and protection of investor interest,"" said the official.
 
 Listing of PSUs would also help the government raise resources to meet disinvestment targets and bridge fiscal gap.
 
 The government, which has been missing its disinvestment targets for past five years, proposes to raise a mammoth Rs 69,500 crore from PSU stake sale in 2015-16."

Now, Nifty likely to take support at 8,000","MUMBAI: The Indian markets ended at day’s low on Tuesday following hawkish commentary from the Reserve Bank of India on interest rates and sub-normal monsoon forecast from the government. 

 The Nifty slipped below its 200-DMA and closed near day’s low at 8,236.45, down 196.95 points or 2.34 per cent from its previous close. The intensity of yesterday’s correction suggest that the pull-back rally in Indian market, which began at low of 7997 and extended upto 8,489, is over. 

 The market is expected to remain in downward bias for next couple of months. 

 ""On all basis which is daily, monthly, weekly, a fresh downtrend has started. After a one month pause, an overall correction took Nifty below 8,280. Now, first kind of support comes around 8,000-8,050. Given the force with which this started, it is fairly decent idea to go short,"" said Ashwani Gujral, Fund Manager, ashwanigujral.com. 

 ""Maybe you will see some small 10-15 point rally tomorrow but it is clear that the pullback rally that we saw from 8,000 is probably now over,"" Gujral added. 

 Rate sensitive led the decline on the index with banks and realty sectors worst hit. The Bank Nifty plunged 640 points or 3.44 per cent. 

 ""The Bank Nifty can possibly retest 17,780, its 200-day average, and possibly break below that. Some kind of thrust has started on the downside and we should see eventually some more lower levels being tested over here both on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty,"" said Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshtacker.com. 

 ""Nifty and Bank Nifty are clearly showing signs of some kind of decline which could last for next few days to come by,"" he added. 

 While the RBI cut repo rate by 25 bps on expected lines, the hawkish commentary on inflation on monsoon concerns spooked sentiment. The pain was aggravated after Science & Technologies Ministries lowered monsoon forecast to 88 per cent of average from 93 per cent in April. 

 According to the ministry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked ministries to prepare for below normal rain. The Cabinet Secretary has called for meet on rain situation. 

 A sub-normal monsoon can spike inflation and delay further rate cut. This will have negative impact on earnings. 

 According to analysts, the market will be rangebound with downward for next quarter unless some positive newsflow boosts sentiment. 

 ""I would agree that in the near short term, scope for the markets to go up from the current levels looks limited. But at the same time, the downside is well-protected,"" said Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities in an interview to ET Now. 

 He is of the view that market shall get into a dull consolidation phase till the next quarter pans out or some of the news flow changes the sentiment. 

 ""This June quarter as well as monsoon outcome in the next two-three weeks are going to be very important. If the outlook of the monsoon comes out good by 15th or 20th of June, one can expect the market to touch or may be cross 8500. Otherwise, we will be rangebound with a low of about 8150-8200 and a high of about 8450,"" he added."

Greece is today a small nation on the southern fringes of Europe but its hold on the popular imagination is immense and its contribution to growth of democracy and the ideals of modern civilisation no less significant. The cradle of European/western civilisation and the birthplace of democracy is today caught in the throes of financial and economic crisis so deep and painful that a comparison with hyperinflationary days of the Weimar Republic nearly a 100 years ago is natural.
 
 But historical analogies dont always serve a useful purpose espeically when you are dealing with situations nearly a 100 years apart and societies and governments that are complex and governed by different rules and circumstances. If our effort is to simply understand the impact this Greek crisis will have on emerging markets, especially India, then it is to a different kind of history that we must turn to. One that is more recent and not rooted in the distant past.
 
 On Monday, Indian markets fell first after the `No’ vote in Greece, recovered and ended in the green much to everybody’s surprise. Even as European markets were swooning, Indian shares were posting a smart recovery. The Nifty ended up over 8,500, the firs time since April this year. Across Asia, things were not so bright though the Shanghai Composite ended higher. Other global markets, especially in Europe were all in red.
 
 Indian markets have been performing well since mid-June against expectations of weakness and a sharp correction. Though the Nifty corrected by more than 10% from its peak, a big sell-off like we saw in the taper tantrum has not happened. Our macro performance is certainly better but the economy is certaily not firing on all cylinders. Corporate earnings will be bad for some time, the recovery is still fragile and key reforms like the goods and services tax are still stuck.
 
 So, why has India done so well? How did we buck the global trend when we were expected to do badly? To understand the answer, we need to to back two years. To the time when Indian markets were whipsawed by comments from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke about the withdrawal of bond buying. In three months of June-August 2013, the FIIs sold Rs 20,000 crore, the rupee crashed all the way to Rs 68 and the markets plunged. It looked at that time that there was no stopping the market’s free fall. India was dubbed one of the `Fragile Five’ and a massive shorting of the currency was going on.
 
 However, in less than one month things changed dramatically. The Fed did not withdraw QE immediately, Raghuram Rajan took charge as the RBI governor initiating a series of measures to calm nervous forex markets and Narendra Modi became the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. All these three developments, the last two primarily, ushered in a bull run that lasted till March 2015. It is important to understand this analogy, historical, but neverthless relevant for the current Indian markets.
 
 Global developments have a tendency to affect shares only when the domestic economy is weak and growth prospects mediocre. They have little or limited impact if the domestic economy is doing well and investors have something to look forward to. When the taper tantrum struck, India’s macro economic situation was terrible. Investors had little faith in the government or the currency. A combination of global headwinds and domestic crisis set the stage for a spectacular run on both the currency and stocks. All this changed when the economy started improving. The currency stabilised after Rajan’s measures and prospects of a change in government and Modi’s victory set the stage for a bull run.
 
 In April this year, when global conditions started becoming unfavourable, Indian markets were hit hard again. The Nifty fell 10% from its peak as as shares looked overvalued, corporate earnings were terrible and the government’s handling of the MAT issue convinced some investors that very little can change in India. Forecasts of a poor monsoon and the prospects of higher food inflation did more damage. Like in 2013, domestic factors combined with global factors pushed Indian shares off their perch. But unlike 2013, the impact has been limited. The Nifty is off from its lows and a favourable June monsoon and a belief that corporate earnings may have bottomed out is driving up markets again
 
 There is also another important factor. The apperance of domestic mutual funds and insurance funds as big buyers of Indian equities. In June alone, they bought Rs 11,000 crore worth of shares, their highest monthly purchase ever. Since January this year, local funds have bought shares worth Rs 33,000 crore even as FIIs stayed away. Their share of the free float market cap of around 2% is too small to make an impact if FIIs start sellign heavily but the interesting thing here is this. The FIIs have not been heavy sellers. Atleast not yet. In May, they sold about $70 mln the first monthly net sale since August 13 and that jumped to about $1 bln in June. But this is still small when compared with taper tantrum period when they were aggressive sellers.
 
 This is not to say that they are not important at all. They are important drivers of sentiment and matter a lot. But when important factors like local fund activity and step-up in government expenditure are taken into account, the global jitters (unless they are of a cataclysmic nature) lose their sting. The Indian market’s behaviour of the past few weeks is a good example of this."

India’s largest insurer is estimated to have invested about Rs 5'500 crore in such debt' people familiar with the matter told ET. 

 The Employee Provident Fund Organisation' or EPFO' bought about Rs 250 crore of the longer-maturity paper maturing in 2030 and 2043. 

 In the eight-year maturity bracket' the RBI cut-off yield was at about 9.16%' 10 basis points higher than the existing secondary market yields for the same paper.

 Fund managers and financial advisors said investors should buy long-term debt schemes, including gilt and income funds, while the risk-averse should lock money in high-yielding fixed deposits before interest rates fall further.
 
 ""Given that more cuts are expected, investors should invest in longer tenure debt funds and fixed deposits,"" said Dwijendra Srivastava, fund manager, Sundaram Mutual Fund .
 
 A cut in interest rates would boost the performance of longerduration bond funds since they are more sensitive to interest rate movements. Gilt funds benefit the most from falling rates or softening bond yields. When yields fall, bond prices rise and vice-versa.
 
 Medium- and long-term gilt funds have given an average return of 16.19% over the last one year, according to Value Research. A gilt fund with an average maturity of 15 years could give you capital appreciation of as much as 5% if interest rates fall by 50 basis points. Add to that the coupon rate of about 7-8%, the total return from such a fund is as high as 13%.
 
 Srivastava believes that a sharp fall in crude oil, copper and coal prices has toned down inflationary expectations. ""Inflation data continue to be lower than investor expectations, supported by subdued demand together and a drop in commodity prices. We expect to see another 50-bps cut during the course of 2015,"" said Rajesh Cheruvu, chief investment officer, RBS Private Banking.
 
 In a falling interest rate scenario, investing in longer tenure bank deposits helps investors."

 SAT reduced the ban on DLF that barred it from accessing capital markets. Sebi had proposed a three-year ban on the firm for withholding information at the time of its public listing in 2007. The ban has now been reduced to six months.
 
 According to analysts, the stock is likely to bounce back supported by renewed optimism but the rally might just fizzle out at higher levels as the debt overhang still remains on the stock.
 
 In the near term, the stock may rally up to 190-200 odd levels, so the bounce back would be purely technical in nature. ""Let us understand that news that is out is of no value, which means that three-year ban is priced in, DLF getting shut out of the capital markets is priced in, any improvement over that is a positive,"" says Ashwani Gujral, Fund Manager, Ashwanigujral.com.
 
 ""DLF is trading below its 200-day moving average. It is sharply down from the intermediate highs that it hit post BJP win. So this is the time to get into DLF because if the worst happens, it is already there,"" he adds.
 
 Gujral is of the view that if anything better happens, DLF could move back towards Rs 180-190 levels, considering the fact that other realty companies have moved up and the realty index has moved up while DLF has lagged behind because of this news.
 
 Slowdown in economic growth and high interest rates in the past couple of years saw DLF's net debt rise to about Rs 20,000 crore as on December 31, 2014.
 
 The highlight of company's third quarter results was rise in debt, which is expected to grow in coming quarter on account of lower sales. DLF's interest payments are nearly equal to the sales value of the last six quarters.
 
 ""In the near term, it is crucial for the company to manage debt and improve sales. We maintain BUY, counting on sales improvement,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities report. The brokerage has a price target of Rs 210.
 
 Mehraboon Irani, Nirmal Bang Securities is of the view that traders will buy for at least a 5% appreciation further from the present level. ""From an investment angle, the stock along with the entire sector real estate and metals is meant only for the contrarians,"" he adds.
 
 Analysts are not ruling out further pressure on DLF in the near term after the initial euphoria settles down because this is not the only issue that the realty major has to deal with.
 
 ""There are number of issues that are negative for DLF, so I believe this would be one of the positive but sale of assets is going to take a long time, and I do not know whether they can come under a decent amount of valuation for those assets which will remain an overhand,"" says Gaurang Shah, VP, Geojit PNB Paribas.
 
 ""Projects are delayed, and there are live examples in front of us wherein projects have started long time back, but there is no completion in the near future and of course we believe that there are lot of investors who would be possibly holding the stock,"" he adds.
 
 Shah is of the view that any upside would be used as an opportunity for investors who would want to take an exit route. ""We believe that in terms of earnings visibility, turnaround would be anytime soon. We have a decisive sell call on DLF,"" says Shah."

The pressure has been from both domestic and global side.
 
 The rupee came under pressure after strong US data led the increased demand for dollar. The Asian currencies are all trading on bearish side. The Indonesian Rupiah hit a 7-week low, yesterday. The Chinese yuan is at a 14-month low. All these currencies are facing different fundamental issues but the general mood in Asian currencies is weak.
 
 On the other hand, there is a strong month-end dollar demand from oil & gas importers. A declining forward premium in the market indicates that exporters have been sellers too.
 
 Weak economic data like poor IIP numbers, high inflation, both WPI and CPI have turned FIIs cautious. The Indian markets are already tackling with high inflation are now also concerned about the initial forecasts of a below normal monsoon due to the El Nino impact.
 
 Even as the Indian equity markets have been making record highs, the euphoria isn’t shared by the Indian currency. Much of the FII inflows have come into the debt markets and not equity.
 
 These inflows also have shown a declining trend in the month of April. The rupee movement going forward will depend on the inflows to a large extent.
 
 Economists feel that RBI at current levels is stretched and may not come out with many more measures. The rupee has seen some pressure on reports that RBI bought dollars to increase forex reserves as well.
 
 The country is in middle of elections and while the equity markets have factored in a stable government, any unexpected verdict can lead to a considerable damage to investor confidence.
 
 Most bankers say, the rupee will continue to move within the 60-62 mark, with 58 as an immediate upside. Decline is not ruled out if the elections come out with an unstable government.
 
 This is going to be yet another truncated week as Mumbai votes today. Banks, equity and commodity markets are shut. While there are many short term factors to watch, in the long term it would be the elections result and the agenda from the new government that would decide the fate of reforms and Rupee.
 
 While there are some tremors felt from the weak Asian data and Ukraine concerns, the effect of tapering of US Fed stimulus on flows will be keenly monitored."

SC dismisses Sebi's plea for insider trading charges against Samir Arora,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sc-dismisses-sebis-plea-for-insider-trading-charges-against-samir-arora/articleshow/33834873.cms,m.economictimes.com,SC dismisses Sebi's plea for insider trading charges against Samir Arora,"MUMBAI: The war against insider trading is turning more difficult for India's capital market regulator Sebi. A recent Supreme Court decision to dismiss Sebi's appeal without going into the merits of a high-profile case is being perceived in legal circles as a setback for the regulator.
 
 The case relates to Sebi's charges of insider trading against Samir Arora, a top fund manager in the late ‘90s and early 2000. A decade ago, Sebi had barred Samir Arora — the former fund manager of Alliance Capital Management — from the securities market for five years, but within months, the order was set aside by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), a quasi-judicial body that settles disputes in capital market transactions. In 2004, Sebi moved the SC challenging the SAT decision.
 
 On April 2, the apex court, in its final order, set aside Sebi's appeal on the grounds that Arora has not been trading during the period he was banned from participating in the Indian stock market. Senior counsel C A Sundaram who appeared for Arora told the court that for all these years, the order passed by Sebi was not given effect to and Arora now operates his business from Singapore and, in these circumstance, there is nothing that deserves to be decided on merits in the appeal.
 
 ""Having regard to the fact that the respondent (Samir Arora) has, in fact, not traded in the Indian market for the period August 2003 to July 2005, we are satisfied that at this distance of time, there is no justifiable reason to interfere with the impugned order,"" said a division bench comprising Justices RM Lodha and Shiva Kriti Singh.
 
 The ruling has come as a blow to Sebi's enforcement of insider trading rules, especially when new regulations are being framed. ""We have lost an opportunity to have a legal benchmark as judgment does not address the question of law........ the ruling throws no light on whether Arora was or wasn't involved in insider trading. It was one of the most important cases Sebi was pursuing,"" said a Sebi official.
 
 According to J N Gupta, former executive director at Sebi and founder of SES, a proxy advisory firm, it would have been better in the interest of market, investors and regulator if the Supreme Court had also considered points of law, which would have enabled all constituents to get the apex court's point of view for future reference.
 
 ""By leaving the points of law open, none of the stakeholders have become wiser and the regulators' struggle for enforcement of law continues,"" said Gupta.
 
 Although rules prohibiting insider trading was among the first to be issued after Sebi was set up as an independent regulator under an act of Parliament in 1992, the regulator has had only limited success in its attempt to crack down on offenders. Insider trading accounted for 7% of the total number of 155 cases investigated by Sebi in 2012-2013, according to Sebi data.
 
 ""It is ironic that despite insider trading regulations being one of the first ones to be brought into force, not a single constitutional court ruling has yet been given.
 
 Successful enforcement cannot be brought about until the judicial system fosters rendering definitive findings within a reasonable time frame,"" said Amit Agrawal, advocate, Supreme Court.
 
 On August 9, 2003, when Sebi first passed its interim order debarring Samir Arora from the securities market, it was confident of getting conviction.
 
 Legal experts said proving insider trading charges are very difficult because of the evidentiary requirements in such cases. ""In insider trading, you must have crystal clear facts. You cannot base your case on possibilities. Sebi must have a case on facts or strong evidence before it moves the higher court,"" said a former senior Sebi official.
 
 Unlike in many countries, no insider trader in India has faced criminal prosecution, which may have emboldened offenders. In 2004, Sebi, in its final order, charged the former Asia-Pacific head of Alliance Capital Mutual Fund for indulging in unfair trade practices after he was found to have sold shares that impacted Alliance's valuation at a time the fund house was an acquisition target. The regulator noted that when the USbased fund decided to sell its Indian interests, Arora was one of the contenders."
Search panel recommends S S Mundra for RBI Deputy Governor role,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/search-panel-recommends-s-s-mundra-for-rbi-deputy-governors-role/articleshow/33085332.cms,m.economictimes.com,Search panel recommends S S Mundra for RBI Deputy Governor's role,"NEW DELHI: The search panel headed by RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is believed to have recommended the name of Bank of Baroda chief S S Mundra for new RBI Deputy Governor in place of K C Chakrabarty who has opted to leave the central bank ahead of his tenure. 

 Interview of CMDs of nine public sector banks were held last Friday here to select a replacement of Chakrabarty, sources said, adding that Mundra is the front runner among the bankers. 

 The panel called those chief who have been heading a bank for more than one year, sources said.The vacancy would arise as Chakrabarty requested to be relieved on April 25, slightly earlier than his scheduled term end on June 30. The Reserve Bank has four Deputy Governors -- two from within the organisation, one economist and one banker.Mundra has been heading Bank of Baroda since January last year. 

 The search panel has now recommended the name to the government for approval. Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by the Prime Minister, will take a final view on the recommendation, the official said. 

 The others who have thrown their hats into the ring for the RBI Deputy Governor's post are the CMDs of Punjab National Bank (K R Kamath), UCO Bank (Arun Kaul), Bank of India (V R Iyer), Oriental Bank of Commerce (S C Bansal), Indian Bank (T M Bhasin), Dena Bank (Ashwani Kumar), Indian Overseas Bank (M Narendra) and Canara Bank (R K Dubey). 

 An RBI deputy governor can be appointed for five years or till the age of 62, whichever is earlier. To be eligible for the post, a candidate needs to be less than 60 years old. After Chakrabarty's exit there will be two vacancies for Deputy Governors in RBI. Government is yet to find a replacement for Anand Sinha who retired in January."
Sebi asks bourses to move 36 companies to normal trading category,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-asks-bourses-to-move-36-companies-to-normal-trading-category/articleshow/16238268.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi asks bourses to move 36 companies to normal trading category,"MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi today said the stock exchanges may consider shifting securities from 36 companies from restricted trade category to normal trading.
 
 In addition, Sebi also advised the stock exchanges to report to it about the action taken in this regard in the Monthly/Quarterly Development Report.
 
 The Securities and Exchanges Board of India (Sebi) said the stock exchanges may consider to shift the scrips of these (36) companies from the Trade for Trade Settlement (TFTS) to a normal Rolling Settlement as these firms have established connectivity with both depositories - NSDL and CDSL.
 
 In 'trade-to-trade' segment, no speculative trading is allowed and delivery of shares and payment of the consideration amount are mandatory.
 
 The scrips which could now be shifted to rolling settlement include Pyramid Trading And Finance, Fortune International, Shree Ganesh Elastoplast and Advance Petrochemicals.
 
 However, the bourses have to check whether 50 per cent of non-promoter holdings are in demat or electronic form, Sebi said.
 
 ""The stock exchanges may consider shifting the trading in these securities to normal Rolling Settlement subject to the following: at least 50 per cent of other than promoter holdings are in dematerialised mode before shifting the trading in the securities of the company from TFTS to normal Rolling Settlement,"" Sebi said.
 
 For this purpose, the listed companies require to obtain a certificate from its Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) and submit the same to the stock exchange, the regulator said.
 
 In case, an issuer company does not have a separate RTA, it may obtain a certificate in this regard from a practicing company Secretary/Chartered Accountant and submit the same to the stock exchange, it added.
 
 ""There are no other grounds/reasons for continuation of the trading in TFTS,"" Sebi said."
Sebi eases rules for market making in illiquid equity cash segment,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-eases-rules-for-market-making-in-illiquid-equity-cash-segment/articleshow/34127881.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi eases rules for market making in illiquid equity cash segment,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Wednesday eased rules for market making in illiquid equity cash segment. The move is aimed at encouraging stock exchanges to offer this scheme for the cash segment, which will help retail investors gain exit from illiquid stocks. 

 Under the scheme, market makers are given incentives for a specified period of time to bring in liquidity and generate investor interest in securities that have limited trading activity. Market makers are brokers who take the risk of holding shares with themselves to facilitate trading. 

 Retail investors are finding it difficult to exit many stocks due to extremely low or even nil trading volume on a daily basis. The Sebi has now extended the period for market making in a stock or index from six months currently to three years. 

 Globally, the practice is to make liquidity enhancement scheme (LES) mandatory for any new products. In India, such a scheme was first allowed only in 2011. There are more than 2,000 illiquid stocks on the leading exchanges and a majority of the trading volumes is concentrated in index options segment in equity derivatives. 

 The Sebi had introduced call auction method to generate volumes, but that has been criticised by brokers as it drives away players due to many operational flaws in the scheme. 

 Sebi has said stock exchanges may be allowed to use 25% of their net profit to pay market makers. Earlier, 25% of net worth of stock exchange could be paid to market makers. 

 Stock exchanges will have to get the structure of their schemes approved by their respective boards, Sebi said. 

 The Sebi had mandated earlier that liquidity enhancement scheme “may be continued till such time as the security achieves mean impact cost of less than 2% for an order size of Rs 1 lakh on the stock exchange during the last 60 trading days”."

 Algorithmic trading or 'algo' in market parlance refers to orders generated at a super-fast speed by use of advanced mathematical models that involve automated execution of trade, and it is mostly used by large institutional investors.
 
 The high frequency trading exposes the market to possible systemic risks.
 
 The rise of High frequency trading (HFT), a type of algo trading, has raised concerns with regard to its impact on market quality, financial stability and regulatory framework.
 
 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is organising its first 'international research conference' from January 27-28 here.
 
 The theme of the conference is ""HFT, Algo Trading and Co-location,"" according to a statement.
 
 During the two-day conference, participants will also discuss issues related to information asymmetry, retail investors, HFT in developing countries and technology as an enabler to re-level the field.
 
 Academicians, market practitioners, regulators from countries such as the US, Spain, Australia, Canada and Japan, among others, would participate at the event.
 
 ""There is a divide in pool of thoughts over positive impact of HFT and associated risks. Because of its relative novelty and the uncertainty related to many of the trading strategies being used today, the debate over high frequency trading is of contemporary relevance,"" Sebi said.
 
 ""As both old and new emerging markets continue to become highly digitised, algo trading strategies will constantly advance,"" it added.
 
 Sebi first issued guidelines on algo trading in March 2012, after it witnessed a growing trend of usage of advanced technology for trading in financial instruments. Later in 2013, the regulator tightened the norms related to algo trading."
SEBI planning to provide fresh avenues for startups through crowd-funding norms,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-planning-to-provide-fresh-avenues-for-startups-through-crowd-funding-norms/articleshow/36731712.cms,m.economictimes.com,SEBI planning to provide fresh avenues for startups through crowd-funding norms,"MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to provide fresh avenues for start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to raise early-stage funding through Internet-based platforms. The regulator on Tuesday proposed new guidelines for crowdfunding in an attempt to provide a more efficient and cost-effective fund-raising platform than public issue or private placement offering.
 
 Crowd-funding is solicitation of funds from multiple investors through an online platform or social networking site for a specific project, business venture or social cause. It can be classified into four categories, including donation crowd-funding, reward crowd-funding, peer-to-peer lending and equity crowd-funding.
 
 Apart from equity-based crowdfunding, other forms of crowd-funding will not come under Sebi’s purview as they do not generally involve issuance of securities for financial returns. Under the security-based crowd-funding, Sebi is exploring three routes such as equity, debt and fund-based crowd-funding.
 
 In most of the cases, funding is sought online on the basis of future projections rather than a viable business model in operation which increases risk of failures and therefore, loss to investors, Sebi said.
 
 Sebi has proposed to allow only accredited investors to participate in crowd-funding. It has defined accredited investors as qualified institutional buyers, companies with a minimum net worth of Rs 20 crore, HNIs with a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore or more and eligible retail investors. “Crowd-funding may provide the much-needed alternative source of financing for start-ups, but the devil lies in details and the effective implementation of Sebi proposal would be critical,” said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal."

 Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed participation of industry bodies, stock exchanges and depositories in the market regulator's programmes on investor education and awareness. 

 In December last year, Sebi began a campaign on 'Investor Grievance Redressal Mechanism', through mass media. 

 As per sources, Sebi has proposed to carry forward the campaign through media in next financial year 2014-15 under which it would inform investors about grievance redressal mechanism, Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) as well as promote securities through mutual funds and primary secondary markets. 

 It is also planning to explore campaigns through other modes such as mobile Internet, they added. 

 According to Sebi, investor education campaigns would help in developing wide and deep markets besides increasing investors' base. 

 Also, Sebi plan includes covering suitable mix of media vehicles to reach maximum investors across the country in 13 major languages."

  The BK Modi-promoted group had earlier announced that it would be merging Spice Televentures, an unlisted telecom unit into Spice Mobiles, its handsets division. 
  
  “Spice Mobile is undertaking the process of reverse merger with Spice Televentures to form Spice Mobility and this will lead to 42 million treasury shares of which 10 million will be kept for employees and the rest sold,” chairman BK Modi said in Delhi. 
  
  Mr Modi said that the reverse merger will result in a cash flow of Rs 300 crore through sale of treasury shares which would be used to fund both the expansion of its mobile retail outlets and acquire smaller firms in the value added services (VAS) space. 
  
  Edelweiss is advising the Group on the merger and consolidation plan. 
  
  “We expect all the clearances to come in by September and by October the (treasury) shares should be available in the market, Mr Modi said, adding: ”Post integration, we will focus on handsets, VAS and retail chains. So any acquisition that is of the right valuation , we would look at it.”

State-owned banks may have to shell out more on perpetual bonds,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/state-owned-banks-may-have-to-shell-out-more-on-perpetual-bonds/articleshow/45849807.cms,m.economictimes.com,State-owned banks may have to shell out more on perpetual bonds,"MUMBAI: State-owned banks may have to fork out reasonably higher rates on their perpetual bond issues, a riskier instrument compliant to the latest international bank standards -Basel III -as a slew of issuers are flocking back to the debt market in the January-March period, adding to the supply side. 

 Public sector banks may more than double Basel-III complaint issues (both tier-1 and tier-2) to around Rs 14,200 crore this quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey.Dena Bank, Allahabad Bank, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, UCO Bank, Syndicate Bank and some others are expected to soon issue perpetual bonds, or tier-I, for about Rs 5001,000 crore each, four people familiar with the matter told ET. 

 Corporation Bank, Vijaya Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce are set to finalise their deals after receiving most bids from arrangers who quoted 9.50-9.54%. Lenders could not be contacted immediately. 

 “If PSU banks' Basel-III bond insurances rise significantly by March, issuers may have to pay higher rates, particularly for perpetual bonds,“ said Shashikant Rathi, senior vice-president & head, Investment, ALM & Capital Markets, Axis Bank.“Perpetual bonds (tier-1) are riskier than tier-2 bonds. Prices should be reasonable in future as the spread is likely to rise.“ 

 Now, issuers seem to be enjoying a fine pricing with about 7580 bps spread, or gap, between two sets of bonds compared with 175-180 basis points five months ago and about 200 bps normally as per global practices. The spread is likely to widen by about 25-35 bps, dealers said. Under the Basel-III requirement, a perpetual bond is more of a quasi-equity obligation with no fixed maturity. If an issuing bank incurs losses in a financial 0year, it cannot make coupon payment to its bondholders even if it has enough liquidity. A tier-2 bond -an unsecured subordinated debt -comes with a fixed maturity. 

 Mutual funds (for credit opportunity fund schemes), exempted provident funds run by individual trusts, mostly invest in perpetual bonds. Those bonds are normally rated one or two notches below issuers' long-term rating. 

 For example, triple-A rated Bank of Baroda's perpetual bonds are rated as AA+. It has raised about Rs 1,000-1,500 crore at 9.48% by selling such securities. 

 “Large debt investors like insurers and EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation) are not there in perpetual bonds while they can invest in tier-2 bonds,“ said Arun Srinivasan, senior vice-president, investments (debt), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. “This combination will help expand the spread between two types of PSU bank bonds.“ 

 “Perpetual bonds come with fiveyear call options but it is not an automatic call option,“ he said, adding that there are stringent RBI requirements to be met before the option can be exercised. 

 Last August, state-owned Bank of India had issued first perpetual bonds to mop up Rs 2,500 crore at 11%. During the same time, Oriental Bank of Commerce had offered tier-II bonds 180 bps lower at 9.20%. Now, BoI's quasi-equity instruments are trading 150 bps lower at 9.50% in the secondary market as prices have moved up.Similar rated bank unsecured debts are trading at 8.70-8.80%. Allahabad Bank has raised Rs 500 crore selling tier-II bonds at 8.78%. 

 “Long-term investors would prefer tier-II bonds over perpetual bonds due to inherent risk elements,“ said Ajay Manglunia, head, fixed income, Edelweiss Financial Services. “Unless issuers offer the right rate they won't be enticing enough investments.“ 

 The overall yield-dip is due to fall in the government benchmark bond yields expecting a future interest rate cut by the RBI."

 Syndicate Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Dena Bank, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India and Andhra Bank aim to mop up a total of about Rs 8,000-9,000 crore in the current financial year, market people familiar with the matter told ET. 

 All bonds will be Basel-III compliant, a global standard for capital requirement. 

 Bangalore-based Syndicate Bank is expected to be the first one off the block, selling 10-year bonds to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore in 2014-15 to shore up its capital base. “We are planning to raise funds through tier-II bond sales. Our board has approved it as we need to fund our credit expansion,“ said a senior official from the bank. 

 Syndicate Bank may sell the bonds in two tranches as it expects rate cuts in coming days. It may sell Rs 750-1,000 crore in the first tranche before the month-end. 

 Syndicate Bank is in discussions with arrangers, which have already quoted 8.98-9%, about 68 basis points higher than the benchmark government bond yield on an annualised basis. Market sources said the bank is asking for 8.95% rate. “The bank has approached LIC of India to place those AA+ rated bonds privately. The largest insurer may have asked a higher rate at 9.05%,“ said one of them. 

 Bank of Maharashtra, meanwhile, plans to collect up to Rs 1,000 crore by selling similar securities. 

 “By December, we will raise up to Rs 1,000 crore additional tier-I bonds,“ its executive director R K Gupta said. “Actually, credit is expected to expand between November and March with some stalled projects opening up now. We should also see loan growth coming from retail, SME and agriculture sectors.“ 

 Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank, Central Bank of India and Andhra Bank, too, have plans to mobilise funds by selling bonds worth about Rs 1,500 crore, Rs 2,300 crore, Rs 1,300 crore and Rs 1,000 crore, respectively. 

 Market sources said most of these banks' boards have already approved these fund-raising plans. 

 Those banks could not be contacted immediately for confirmation and comments. 

 According to arrangers, all lenders are expecting a fall in interest rates and, hence, they do not want to raise the full amount in one go. 

 In the initial tranche, lenders would be selling bonds in the broad range of Rs 500-1,000 crore. Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali Life Insurance Company, feels that these bonds are good long-term prospects. “For any long-term investor, it makes sense to invest in these bonds with the government support, subject to their secondary market liquidity,“ he said. “BaselIII compliant perpetual or tier-I bonds should offer higher yields due to inherent risk element.“ 

 The benchmark bond yields have dipped 55-60 basis points in the last 5-6 months. Bond yields and prices move in the opposite direction. 

 This has given an edge to all issuers whose borrowing cost has come down significantly."

  “We are in talks with a couple of private equity and strategic investors,” said executive director Rishab Sethi, without disclosing their identity. A person close to the matter said US-based Water Asset Management LLC and Veolia Water have evinced initial interest to pick up equity in the project. SBI Capital Markets has been advising SPML on the fund raising.
  
  A special purpose vehicle, SPML Bhiwandi Water Supply Management, is setting up the project for Rs 700 crore. The company plans to raise Rs 400 crore debt for the project which is expected to be operational by 2012-13 . SPML will develop the project for Bhiwandi Nizampur Municipal Corporation and will also operate and maintain it for 25 years. “The project has potential of generating Rs 5,000 crore during the period, which will be shared between SPML and the municipal corporation ,” said Mr Sethi.
  
  The Bhiwandi project will supply drinking water to over one million people in the area. It will be one of the largest water management projects under public private partnership by the Maharashtra government after the sector was opened for private players.
  The Indian water and waste water market is pegged at $4 billion and is growing at around 12% a year, according to Virtus Global Partner, a global consultancy.
  
  Half of the revenue generated from the sector comes from the government run bodies and the remaining is contributed by the private firms. India plans to invest around Rs 1.4 lakh crore by 2012 for water management . SPML, one of the leading local players, earns about 62% of its revenue from water management services. It is developing projects in Maharashtra, Gujarat , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Last year, it registered sales of Rs 1500 crore."
Three reasons why India Incs credit scores are on the mend,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/three-reasons-why-india-incs-credit-scores-are-on-the-mend/articleshow/47116080.cms,m.economictimes.com,Three reasons why India Inc’s credit scores are on the mend,"India’s corporate credit score is improving, thanks to its lower debt burden and debt-rating upgrades outnumbering downgrades. According to Bloomberg data, the average ratio of upgrade to downgrade by the three credit rating agencies — Crisil, Icra and Care — is 2.35 in FY15, the highest since FY11.
 
 An improved credit rating also reduces concerns over lenders’ asset quality. Most corporates are rated between BBB and B that carry higher risk-weight and lock up more lender capital than exposure to Triple-A rated corporates. Thus, upgrades help banks to save capital through lower risk-weights.
 
 There have been more than 109 upgrades over the last three quarters as against 47 downgrades. Credit ratings have improved for companies like Ashok Leyland, Ranbaxy and Ceat, while Jindal Steel & Power, Parsvnath Developers, Everest Kanto Cylinder and Bajaj Electricals were downgraded.
 
 
There are 3 reasons for improved ratings:
 
 .. Corporates have put in efforts to cut cost. “We have seen companies finding innovative ways to bring down cost and ease the working capital burden,” said DR Dogra, MD & CEO, CARE.
 
 .. Companies are refinancing debts to lower interest burden.
 
 .. Third, since the more vulnerable companies were downgraded in FY12 and FY13, there have been lesser downgrades subsequently. Also, some of the companies which were downgraded two years ago have bettered their credit profile."

Top BSE stakeholder urges FM Arun Jaitley to review exchange norms,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/top-bse-stakeholder-urges-fm-arun-jaitley-to-review-exchange-norms/articleshow/47791895.cms,m.economictimes.com,Top BSE stakeholder urges FM Arun Jaitley to review exchange norms,"MUMBAI: Toronto-based investor Thomas Caldwell, who owns a 5% stake in the BSE, has written to the finance minister Arun Jaitely seeking a re-think on several norms that govern the stock exchanges. 

 Former RBI governor Bimal Jalan, who headed the committee to suggest norms for stock market related infrastructure institutions, had submitted his report to Sebi in 2010. The suggestions of the committee, which were accepted by Sebi in 2012, were criticised by some experts then. Besides restrictions on ownership of stock exchanges, Jalan also suggested a cap on profits made by the exchanges citing them as ‘public institutions’. The report disallowed listing of exchanges and placed restrictions on salaries of key managerial personals. 

 “As one of the largest owners of the NYSE, as well as an investor in 36 other exchanges around the world, we were stunned by the report’s deep flaws which were based upon the fallacious notion that exchanges were ‘public utilities’ and thus requiring profit controls, pricing, compensation and strict ownership,” Caldwell said in his letter. He said the Jalan committee’s thinking has infected virtually all exchanges’ thinking and regulation since. “The Jalan type control over so many aspects of exchanges is more indicative of a far smaller, less developed country. What the report said to the world is that India’s financial regime is still about favouritism, abrupt and dramatic ground rule changes, the old Indian bias for government control and a lack of confidence in its own capital market structures,” the letter said. When contacted, Bimal Jalan declined to comment."

 Vaya Finserv, a business correspondent for banks, will apply to become a small bank to commence lending and deposittaking activities in unbanked villages, said Akula. The company, populated by former SKS Microfinance staff and 65% owned by SKS Trust, may even seek a licence for a payments bank.
 
 ""Micro lending is my passion,"" said Akula, who was ousted from SKS Microfinance, the company he founded, in a boardroom battle. ""We understand lending to low-income people. We know what a Rs 25,000 loan means to them.’’
 
 Akula’s SKS became the only microlender to list on the stock exchanges with the backing of private equity firm Sequoia Capital and Infosys Technologies founder NR Narayana Murthy. He had a troubled relationship with SKS Microfinance.
 
 Though he sowed the seeds of growth as a not-for-profit group, it became a forprofit company. When he wanted to return after the company’s valuations turned into billions of dollars, the board pushed him back.
 
 The company also dragged the entire industry into regulatory quagmire with the Andhra Pradesh state coming up with rules after allegations of harassment by SKS staff. Subsequently, RBI came up with rules governing microlending with a cap on interest rates.
 
 ""I had a three year non-compete agreement with SKS and that is over,"" said Akola.
 
 ""The biggest learning factor was that hyper growth without commensurate systems"" is not the right way to run a company.
 
 Now that the RBI is calling for applications to issue licence for small and payment banks, Akula believes his expertise in microlending could be utilised to achieve financial inclusion. ""We are not overconfident, but we are hopeful,"" says Akula. ""This (Vaya) doesn’t have suited-booted people, but those who understand financial inclusion."" Akula would be the non-executive chairman of the company."

ET Now: What really did the trick for some NBFC stocks? 

 Prashastha Seth: There were rumours in the market that the new guidelines would possibly be slightly favourable to the NBFC stocks and things might not be as bad as what the markets were expecting. I track Manappuram and Muthoot, so I can comment on that. The results of these two companies have been fairly decent. They have been able to maintain decent growth. They have been able to maintain volumes. They have been able to maintain margins. 

 So some of the things that the markets were pricing in terms of strong degrowth in the volumes. So that is the reason why there are some amount of buying coming in, in some of the gold financing companies. People have realized that over a period of next three to five years these businesses could be a 15-20%. 

 Earning growth business where you could potentially make 18% to 20% ROEs and from that perspective the stocks were trading cheap. So to that extent, there is recovery in these stocks and as I said there were rumours that things on the regulatory front might be slightly better than the worst players of the market. So those two things combined, essentially lead to volumes, lead to price rise in Manappuram and Muthoot yesterday."

Why Sebi should not treat PE investors as a privileged lot,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/pe-vc-funds-with-five-or-fewer-investors-attract-sebi-scrutiny/articleshow/94287098.cms,m.economictimes.com,"PE, VC funds with five or fewer investors attract Sebi scrutiny","Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds holding money for 5 or fewer investors have drawn the attention of the capital market regulator.

Do such funds act as vehicles of family offices and promoters? Do managers of such funds come under the influence of a handful of wealthy investors? Is the regulatory interest a precursor to a broad-based rule requiring a larger number of investors?

While the intent of the regulator is unclear, the Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has in an email on September 12 --- a week after it asked PE and VC funds about their valuation practices --- sought various information on funds formed with a small club of investors, two senior industry persons told ET.

These funds have to give details of investors in a scheme: name of the investors; whether it’s an individual, company, limited liability partnership, or trust; the country of the investor; the amount it has committed and the quantum of fund raised. 

They have to also submit the name of the investee company, its country of origin, nature of business, and the instrument issued (equity, debt, convertible etc) to raise money. The details have to be provided for every scheme of an alternative investment fund (AIF) - the regulatory term for PE, VC and angel funds. Besides, the name of a contact person in every fund along with the mobile number have to be shared with Sebi.

“Usually, funds with less than five contributors (excluding the sponsor and the manager) are captive in nature. We have seen many family offices, large investors, and corporates using AIFs to hold stakes in companies. Probably, they don’t want to reveal their identities. Investee companies too prefer the name of a single AIF in the cap table rather than five different investors in the fund… But we don’t really know why Sebi has asked for the information. Maybe, it wants to know more about such captive funds,” said a person with a fund trustee.

According to Tejesh Chitlangi, senior partner at IC Universal Legal, while AIFs, unlike mutual funds, do not have any broad-basing requirement, SEBI may be examining the feasibility of introducing some form of investor broad-basing for AIFs. “But any such rule, if under consideration, should not be as stringent as the 20/25 requirement prescribed for mutual funds because mutual funds raise retail money unlike AIFs which approach big-ticket investors through privately placed AIFs,” said Chitlangi.

MFs have to follow a 20/25 rule under which every scheme needs to have a minimum 20 investors with no investor holding 25% units in the scheme. An AIF, however, can even have a single investor though not more than a quarter of the fund corpus can be invested in a single entity.

Also, it may be perceived that a small group of investors end up influencing the fund manager and the portfolio construction. “But such a concern may not be well placed as funds need to make a regulatory disclosure in case investors have any role in approving investment decisions, including through annual audit exercises. A fund of one investor is not unusual as India has typically been accessed through master-feeder type structures, where in addition to the feeder, the master fund may have only sponsor group participation,” said Richie Sancheti, founder partner at the law firm Richie Sancheti Associates (RSA).

In the master-feeder structure, a fund pool may be created in a financial centre Mauritius, Delaware, Singapore or Gift City, with subscriptions from a number of investors across markets, there can be a single master entity investing in the AIF in India.

“Sebi is asking for data for certain analyses. This will be used to take decisions on the policy front,” said a person close to the development.

Sebi has been gathering a wide range of data on AIFs, probably given the rise in their importance as investment vehicles. Often, such exercise can precede regulatory changes. On September 6, the regulator had asked AIFs to disclose their valuation methodologies – a query that assumes significance as most funds are close-ended vehicles investing in unlisted securities of startups. 

A week before that Sebi asked funds to spell out whether the sponsor and manager of the funds were owned and controlled by persons who are foreign residents. Even in the latest communication (dated September 12), funds with five or lesser investors have been told to declare whether their sponsors are controlled by non-residents. A sponsor contributes Rs 5 crore or 2.5% of the fund whichever is lower."

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: The underlying strength has been absolutely impeccable. How much more to go before law of gravity and reality kicks in?
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: 8000 on the Nifty is coming and coming pretty fast. I have been travelling throughout the length and breadth of the country meeting our clients and investors post the budget and let me tell you, everybody is thinking the same way. That is, buying cheap stocks and compromising on quality. So buying something which is not quality but something which is cheap and avoiding that something is very expensive. But it is quality but these quality stocks are a part of the benchmark indices, whether it be the midcap or the large cap names. So it is not the surprise that the markets are going to do something different than what the general public is thinking and on that basis, even though valuations continue to become even more expensive for quality stocks because nobody is wanting to own them except institutional investors, markets are still headed higher. We should see 8000 on Nifty coming pretty fast.
 
 
 
 
ET Now: What is the sense that you are getting though once you see 8000 or rather even a 7900 on the index? Is it going to be the same scenario that we saw last time around when we hit 7800 where you get a patch of correction and consolidation coming in. Is that the cycle that the market is likely to follow?
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: The difference between 7800 previously which had come and this time around is that the high beta junk names or so to say bad quality stocks are still 20 per cent below those levels and at the same time, sector rotation, IT and pharma which was not like, have continued to do well, likes of consumer names have continued to do well. So going forward, the overall trajectory on the economy is also looking slightly better in terms of deficient rains having come down from 45 per cent to something like 27 per cent. That gives a further fillip to the markets and then further data indicators whether it be on the results front or whether it be on the IIP inflation numbers front. That will continue to drive the markets forward but the direction continues to remain positive."

	""What makes the current set up on RIL interesting is the fact that the stock has rallied in the last few trading sessions and is showing signs of gathering momentum as if markets have already sensed some substantial positives from its numbers on Friday,"" said Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com.
	
	""We expect the stock to break its near term resistance of Rs 920 and rally further from here as the stock looks bullish on its short and medium term charts after a long time,"" he added.
	
	Most analysts have a positive view on the stock and expect it to rally ahead of results. With expectations of positive results a good pop-up on the stock cannot be ruled out on Monday.
	
	The recent price movement in Reliance Industries is an up move from the support base of multi-year consolidation.
	
	The current up move from Rs 674 is a part of larger pattern formation that began from January 2008 top at Rs 1,626. It is a part of the five years of consolidation. Therefore, it is a good level to initiate long position at the current price of Rs 864.
	
	""If the pattern described above holds, and if the present multiyear consolidation continues and if the stock breakout of this multiyear consolidation, then the low of June 2012 i.e. Rs 674 would most probably not be tested for couple of years,"" said B irendra Kumar Singh, Technical Analyst, FRR Shares.
	
	""Strategy would be to continue to hold the existing long positions. In case of a correction fresh long position can be initiated between Rs 890-860 levels,"" he added.
	
	RIL trades at 11.3x FY15E adjusted EPS of Rs 84.4 and company's new refining/petrochemical projects are likely to add to earnings from end- FY15E/FY16E.
	
	Analysts advise investors to adopt Long Strangle, Long Call Butterfly, Long Call Ladder and Long Put Butterfly as some of the strategies that can be deployed ahead of RIL results and keep the position open depending on their own time frame or till expiry.
	
	We have collated recommendations from various analysts as to what investors should do with RIL stock ahead of its crucial results:
	
	Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com
	
	Reliance Industries might well fuel the next leg of the current rally and may scale to Rs 1050 levels should the results be to the markets liking.
	
	We recommend buying into the stock not only with the Monday's pop in mind but as a medium term positional hold with a 3-month target price of Rs 1065.
	
	Manoj Muralidharan, AVP- Derivatives, IIFL PReMIA
	
	The scrip witnessed excellent delivery of around 36.71 lakh which is almost 1.5 times more than 5-day average. A Rs 920 strike call option has seen excellent buying. Good put writing has been seen at Rs 900 strikes.
	
	A good cash-based buying followed by O-T-M Call buying along with long build-up in derivatives market, we expect Reliance to see positive momentum in short term, specifically tomorrow.
	
	Traders should take a covered call by buying, RIL July futures at Rs 915 and sell 940 strike call option at 11, with stop loss of Rs 880 for a target of Rs 940.

	Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Trader & Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments
	
	Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is in bullish terrain. After a long bout of sluggish movements and range bound price action, the stock has managed to commit profits for its traders and investors on the buy side!
	
	RIL was sideways between Rs 775 and Rs 855. After having gone past the Rs 855 mark, it has seen a very smooth rally which has taken it to its present price level of Rs 915.
	
	Going forward, I am of the opinion the stock can achieve Rs 940 in the short term and can go past the 1000 mark in the medium term.
	
	Nidhi Saraswat - Senior Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
	
	Technically, the stock has shown consolidation within Rs 765-850 and then given breakout in last few weeks, which is positive indicator. Investors can go long in the stock with near term stop loss below Rs 880 and likely target of Rs 975-1000.

	The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo declined 2.1 percent to 12,135.01. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.4 percent to 1,995.99. Benchmarks in Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines also fell.


	The 30-share index ended at 18,864.81, up 28 points or 0.15 per cent. It touched a high of 18,959.48 and a low of 18,796.60 in trade today.


	The Nifty ended at 5,704, up 21 points or 0.38 per cent. It touched a high of 5,720.95 and a low of 5,675.90 in trade today.


	“Today being very first day of FY14, many of the beaten down stocks gained momentum; such as STC, IVRCL, BF Utilities, Hindustan Copper, Madhucon Projects, Welcorp, HDIL DLF etc.,” A.K. Prabhkar, Senior Vice President - Equity Research at Anand Rathi, said.


	“Additionally, O.I post settlement is lowest in 8 years, so most investors are taking fresh positive for FY14,” he added.


	The BSE Realty index advanced 5.3 per cent, the BSE Capital Goods Index rose 1.6 per cent and the BSE Healthcare Index ended 0.97 per cent higher.


	The S&P BSE Sensex rebounded from its first quarterly drop since December 2011. The Nifty started the fiscal year 2014 with two back-to-back monthly losses and a 3.8% cut in the past quarter as disappointment with the budget and weak macros hit sentiment.


	However, today’s gains can be largely attributed to more of technical factors. Next likely trigger for the index is on Q4 earnings which will drive the index higher in April, say experts.


	Indian markets came under pressure in 2013, amid the weakening economic growth in a decade, widening deficits and the rising inflation. Today’s HSBC PMI report showed that India’s manufacturing expansion slowed to a 16-month low in March.


	“Indian markets are up largely on account of a technical pullback that should be seen as a continuation of the fierce short covering witnessed in the dying hours of trade on Thursday,” Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com said.


	“The current momentum may well push the Nifty further up t0 5725-5740 levels but is unlikely to get past 5750 which is going to be the most important resistance going forward,” he added.


	According to Saraogi, once markets are done getting over expiry pressures, the indices will resume taking cues from the global markets where weakness is likely to persist.


	Here is a list of ten stocks which are likely to be in focus throughout this week:


	Analyst: Vinit Pagaria, VP – Investment Strategies at Microsec capital Ltd


	TCS (BUY - CMP: 1575.75 SL: 1528 Tgt1: 1618 Tgt2: 1645)


	TCS is in a strong uptrend and has rallied smartly in this calendar year. The stock however failed to go down and has been consolidating in the 1530-1590 range. A move beyond 1600 is likely to trigger a fresh rally in the stock.


	Cairn India (SELL - CMP: 272.45 SL: 283 Tgt1: 265 Tgt2: 256)


	Cairn India has been falling continuously since the last couple of months. The downtrend is likely to persist further and any pullbacks up to 280 odd level can be used to sell the stock.


	Century Textiles (BUY - CMP: 287.05 SL: 265 Tgt1: 308 Tgt2: 335)


	Century Textiles has had a free fall from a high of 451.80 made on 7th January 2013. The stock is currently near its support levels and a pullback from here could take the stock higher up to 308 followed by 335 odd level in the next couple of weeks.


	 

	
	 

	Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (BUY - CMP: 1766.50 SL: 1710 Tgt1: 1832 Tgt2: 1895)


	Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is trading near its 200 DMA and the stock movement has given signs of a reversal in the short term. The rising trend of the stock is likely to resume again and the stock could rally all the way up to 1895 in the medium term.


	HCL Technologies (BUY – CMP: 795 SL: 776 Tgt1: 814 Tgt2: 828)


	HCL Technologies is in a secular bull trend and is close to its life high. The stock is likely to give a fresh breakout and move into un-chartered territory. The stock can be bought with a stop loss below 776 and a target of 828 in the next few trading sessions.


	Analyst: Gaurav S. Ratnaparkhi, Technical Analyst at Sharekhan Ltd


	Siemens: BUY, SL 529, TGT 594


	The stock on the daily chart shows a three wave set back, which is a corrective structure. Hereon it is expected to start fresh move on the upside. It can test its recent high of 594 with a potential to stretch beyond that


	Tata Global: BUY, SL 122, TGT 134


	The stock has taken support near the junction of the swing low & daily lower Bollinger Band. Daily momentum indicator is showing positive divergence. Thus the stock can bounce back sharply


	IFCI: BUY, SL 24.90, TGT 28.20


	The stock has formed an Ending Diagonal, which is a bullish pattern in this particular case. Near the end of the pattern the stock seems to have formed a Two Bar Reversal pattern


	Union Bank: BUY, SL 208, TGT 238


	The stock has taken support near 61.8% retracement of the previous rally. Daily & weekly lower Bollinger Bands are providing additional support to the stock. Thus it can go for a short term pullback.


	Brokerage Firm: SMC


	Gitanjali Gems: BUY, SL 565, Target 620


	It made a 52-week low at Rs273 on 25th June 2012 and 52-week high of Rs621.05 on 11th March 2013. The 200 days Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the stock on the weekly chart is currently at Rs316.10.


	The uptrend is intact in the stock and it is trading in a consolidation phase. Moreover, it has negated the weak sentiments in the major indices which could be considered a significant point in its continuation of upward momentum.


	One can ‘Buy’ in the range of Rs578-585 levels with closing below stop loss of Rs 565 levels for the target of Rs 620-630 levels.

Bill Gross' love for Mexico stays unchanged despite his exit from Pimco,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bill-gross-love-for-mexico-stays-unchanged-despite-his-exit-from-pimco/articleshow/47810608.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bill Gross' love for Mexico stays unchanged despite his exit from Pimco,"By Brendan Case
 
 New York: Bill Gross is no longer running the world's biggest bond fund, but one thing hasn't changed: his love for Mexico.
 
 In a Twitter post on Thursday, Gross said the country offered the ""most attractive yields in the world,"" a week after proclaiming on a CNBC interview that Mexico's government debt was his ""best"" recent trade idea. 

 The 71-year-old Gross, who departed from Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) in September, emerged as a Mexico bull three years ago when he praised its bonds and currency as the nation prepared sweeping changes to its energy policies. Now at Janus Capital Group, he's betting that slowing inflation will lead the central bank to keep interest rates lower than traders are anticipating. 

 ""He's postulating that Mexico will successfully see off inflationary pressures and the actual path of the policy rate will come in lower than what you're seeing in the forward curve,"" said Michael Roche, a fixed-income strategist at Seaport Global Holdings. ""He's sharing that observation with everyone and I must say it does seem pretty reasonable."" 

 Mexico was one of the top 10 holdings in Gross's $1.5-billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund as of May 31, using derivatives contracts to establish a bullish position, according to fund data on Janus's website. 

 Gross didn't respond to requests for comment made by telephone and e-mail to the investment company's press office. 

 Forward contracts indicate Mexico's central bank will raise benchmark borrowing costs to more than 7 per cent by 2020 from a record-low 3 per cent. Gross is buying contracts on yields for the 2020-25 period, according to an e-mail from Janus. 

 With the country's annual inflation rate at a more-thanfour-decade low of 2.9 per cent and the economy plagued by sluggish growth, it's not hard to see why Gross is skeptical rates will rise that high. 

 The central bank said just last week that the inflation rate will probably end the year at less than its 3 per cent target. That would be the lowest since 1968, when information on price changes was limited to Mexico City. And while central bank officials have suggested they're likely to raise rates when the US makes a move, the Federal Reserve has signaled its increases are likely to be gradual. 

 Gross is ""saying he likes debt in the middle of the range, with maturities of five to 10 years,"" Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura Holdings, said from New York.""The curve is pricing in rate increases but our view is that it might be pricing in more hikes than will actually happen."" 

 Gross started talking up Mexico in June 2012, when he said he favoured the na tion's bonds over German debt, citing the Latin American nation's higher yields and lower debt levels.While Mexico's peso-denominated debt outperformed Germany in dollar terms over that span, its 7.1 per cent return still lags behind the average for emerging markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

 In his June 10 interview on CNBC, Gross called attention to Mexico's inflation-linked bonds. 

 He said traders were demanding too large of a premium to buy the debt relative to similar US securities and that the Mexico bonds may also get a boost from a rebound in the peso, which had been ""trashed"" in recent months."
BSE plans foray into commodity trading; board gives nod for new platform,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bse-plans-foray-into-commodity-trading-board-gives-nod-for-new-platform/articleshow/44954525.cms,m.economictimes.com,BSE plans foray into commodity trading; board gives nod for new platform,"MUMBAI: Asia’s oldest stock exchange BSE will soon make a foray into commodity trading. A proposal to start a new platform for commodities trading was approved by the BSE board on October 20, said two sources familiar with the development. 

 BSE’s rival in equity trading, the National Stock Exchange (NSE), already has a presence in the commodity segment through a stake in National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange. Bourses such as BSE entering commodity trading are eyeing the passage of Forwards Contract Regulations Act (FCRA) that could boost trading volumes as it allows launch of further derivative products in the segment. 

 Earlier this year, the Kotak Group bought a 15% stake in the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). While the FCRA Bill was tabled in Parliament last year, the previous government did not pass it in the wake of a major scam at spot exchange NSEL. Despite the severe crisis post the NSEL scam, MCX still dominates commodity trading in India with close to 80% market share. 

 Experts said new players are hopeful that the supremacy of MCX could be challenged with advanced technology. Akin to the equity market landscape where NSE and BSE are the only two national-level exchanges, the commodity space is divided between two bourses — MCX and rival NCDEX. Data from the Forwards Market Commission showed the two share 99% of the total commodity market turnover with MCX leading with 80-85% market share. 

 There are a dozen other commodity exchanges, including National Multi-Commodity Exchange of India and ACE Derivatives and Commodity Exchange that see a negligible turnover. Commodity trading gained popularity in India after MCX was launched in 2004 and it saw a sustained growth till 2013. The segment witnessed trades of over Rs 6 lakh crore every fortnight. 

 Levying of a Commodity Transaction Tax, however, resulted in a near 50% drop in trading volumes in 2013. MCX is a leader in bullion, oil & gas and energy contracts while NCDEX focuses on futures trading in agricultural commodities."

 Besides, National Stock Exchange (NSE) would shift scrips of five companies to the restricted trading category. 

 The stocks would be transferred to the trade-for-trade segment or 'T' group with effect from February 23, NSE and BSE said in separate notifications. 

 Under the trade-for-trade segment, no speculative trading is allowed and delivery of shares and payment of consideration amount are mandatory. 

 The decision is part of a surveillance review to ensure market safety and safeguard the interest of investors, the bourses said. 

 Some of the scrips which would be moved to 'T' Group on the BSE are Bemco Hydraulics, Accurate Transformers, Southern Ispat and Energy, Genera Agri Corp and Autoriders Finance. 

 Clutch Auto, Elder Pharmaceuticals, JIK Industries, PSL Ltd, Tecpro Systems are the five companies that would shift to the restricted trading category on NSE. 

 Further, BSE and NSE also issued a list of stocks that would continue in the trade-for-trade segment on their respective platforms for their failure to convert mandatory 50 per cent public shareholding into dematerialised format. 

 While BSE has identified more than 800 companies whose securities will remain under restricted category, NSE has listed nearly 41 companies. 

 As per Sebi guidelines, shares of listed companies which have not achieved at least 50 per cent of their public holding in dematerialised (demat) or electronic form would have to trade in the 'T' Group category."

What is your view on the index at 6250 and also your stock specific trades for this afternoon? 

 The Nifty Junior is down and even small caps are also not doing so well. Large caps are doing well. Sometimes small caps do well and at other times large caps do well. Banking is beginning to participate a bit. That is leading to some strength may be 80 to 100 points more to around 6350. I do not think you can take more than a 150-200 point view. The stronger groups on all sorts of correction should be bought. Try to keep away from the weaker groups where you have trading rallies. That is the trading strategy you have to follow. SBI, Kotak Mahindra have been beaten up. When that happens to a quality stock generally that is about the bottom because that is where larger players come into buy."

In a meeting with rubber industry delegation, development commissioner for rubber in the Ministry of Commerce J S Deepak has asked the industry to work out the details of the policy.
 
 “The government has welcomed our suggestion of having a national policy for rubber. In the next few months, the industry will hold consultations with all the stakeholders including growers, machinery manufacturers, synthetic rubber producers, manufacturers, importers, exporters and educational institutes and a draft report will be submitted”, said Niraj Thakkar, president of All India Rubber Industries Association (AIRIA), who headed the delegation to the Ministry of Commerce.
 
 According to AIRIA, rubber is a sunrise industry in India with immense potential for growth if policy enablers are put in place. A national policy on rubber is critical to optimize the potential of the sector. “We are awaiting suggestions from Sheela Thomas, chairman of Rubber Board, as a key stakeholder, on the national rubber policy with a view to giving direction to the industry’s efforts”, added Thakkar.
 
 According to him the government is supportive of increasing import duty on finished rubber products to address the challenge of inverted duty structure. AIRIA had asked for urgently increasing import duties on finished rubber products to enable local units particularly the SMEs face the challenge of fast growing cheaper imports.

"Coffee Day Resorts to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore via IPO",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/coffee-day-resorts-to-raise-up-to-rs-1500-crore-via-ipo/articleshow/37739703.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Coffee Day Resorts to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore via IPO","By KR BALASUBRAMANYAM
 
 BANGALORE: The holding company of Café Coffee Day, India's biggest café chain, is gearing up to mop up Rs 1,200-1,500 crore through a proposed initial public offering (IPO) in about nine to 12 months.
 
 The domestic listing will see the holding company, Coffee Day Resorts, sell 10-15 per cent for $150 million (Rs 900 crore), valuing the group backed by KKR & Co at about $1 billion, sources in the coffee-to-technology conglomerate told ET.
 
 Private equity (PE) investors are expected to dilute up to 10 per cent of their stake. ""This is the right time to raise capital to fund expansion of our businesses,"" VG Siddhartha, the 54-year-old founder of the Bangalore-based group had told ET recently.
 
 The Chikmagalurborn coffee planter-turned-billionaire believes that the retail sector in the country offers a huge growth opportunity in the next five to 10 years. Interestingly, Siddhartha is not selling his stake in the group to demonstrate his faith and commitment to the Coffee Day growth story.
 
 The promoters are likely to seek a valuation of over $600 million (Rs 3,600 crore) for coffee retail, considered the jewel in the group's crown. It is expected to do an Ebidta (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) of Rs 200 crore this year. Siddhartha, who pioneered the café culture in India plans to add about 150 stores this year (2014-15) to the chain of 1,500 plus cafes.
 
 He wants to be a total of 2,500 (both café and express) outlets in three years. He is likely to plough back more than 70 per cent of the funds raised into retail business as Coffee Day gears up to ward off competition from foreign café chains, including Starbucks which entered the Indian market in October 2012 in partnership with the Tata group.
 
 Ahead of the listing process, the holding company's name will undergo a minor tweaking to reflect the group's conglomerate nature. The holding company has interests in coffee retailing, technology, logistics, and SEZ & hotels, besides smaller businesses like financial services (Way2Wealth), furniture (Daffco), and coffee plantations, among others.
 
 The promoters—Siddhartha, his family and associates—own about 70 per cent of the stake in the holding company, while private equity players, KKR, New Silk Route and Standard Chartered have the rest. The investors see the turnaround in the capital markets as a good opportunity to seek returns. The promoters and the holding company also own more than 20 per cent stake in the Bangalorebased IT services firm, Mindtree, which is valued at about Rs 1,500 crore."
Company Law Board accepts private equity investors' plea on Fourcee forensic audit,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/company-law-board-accepts-private-equity-investors-plea-on-fourcee-forensic-audit/articleshow/29223530.cms,m.economictimes.com,Company Law Board accepts private equity investors' plea on Fourcee forensic audit,"MUMBAI: The Company Law Board has granted private equity investors General Atlantic and India Equity Partners’ plea to conduct an independent audit of Fourcee Infrastructure Equipments to check alleged financial irregularities.
 
 The Mumbai bench of the CLB last week directed Deloitte Touche Tohmantsu India to conduct an independent forensic audit of Fourcee, a logistics firm specialising in tank trailers and equipment, and submit its report by January 31.
 
 “If it is found the respondents are not extending their co-operation and/or not taking appropriate steps required for the purpose of the preparation of interim report, further interim relief will be considered even prior to filing of the interim report,” the CLB said on January 13.
 
 General Atlantic Singapore Fund PTE and India Equity Partners (IEP), which have invested $107 million and $24 million, respectively, into Fourcee, had approached the CLB in October last year, saying they suspected financial misappropriation by promoters Rajesh Lihala, who is the executive chairman, and Vinay Singh, the managing director.
 
 The allegations surfaced after an audit of the books of accounts for year ended March 2013 by BSR & Company, an affiliate of KPMG. After this the PE funds, along with the board of directors of the company, appointed Ernst & Young LLP for forensic audit. However, after the auditor submitted its initial report, Fourcee filed a suit against Ernst & Young before the Bombay High Court, alleging force auditing and defamation.
 
 “Before Ernst & Young started with the assignment, the company has protested to the appointment of Ernst & Young, despite which the report was prepared on the instructions of the investors and without obtaining any clarification from the company or the promoters and on the basis of documents not procured from the company,” the company said in response to ET’s email query.
 
 “The proceedings that have been initiated by the investors are nothing but a hostile takeover attempt on the part of the investors to take control of the management and functioning of the company,” it said."

The broader indices traded in tandem, with key benchmark rising 2.3-2.6 per cent for the week.

This week will see investors reacting to the RBI policy outcome, its commentary on inflation, IIP reading, quarterly earnings and trends in the bond market.


Here's how analysts read the market pulse: Ajit Mishra, VP Research at Religare Broking, said supportive global cues, as well as growth-oriented Budget announcements aided sentiments but profit-taking in the later part marginally trimmed the gains.

""Participants will be closely eyeing the MPC’s monetary policy review meet next week and its outcome is scheduled on February 9. With the timeline set by the US Fed for tightening, it would be crucial to see how the MPC responds to it especially when the government has set the growth agenda in the Union Budget. Besides, on the macro front, IIP data will be released on February 11.

Tech View: Nifty50 fails in comeback attemptsAnalysts advised investors to maintain a neutral stance on the market.

""As long as the Nifty50 does not break below 16,850, it is more likely that the lower top formed on the daily chart may end up being a minor decline. Considering these factors we suggest traders to maintain a neutral to a mildly bullish outlook for the coming week. The immediate resistance on the higher side is placed at 17,800 level,"" said Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research at Samco Securities. 

Mohammad said it looks prudent to remain neutral and that intraday traders can short below 17,460 for a modest target of 17,350 level.

  You have also got some calls from the IT space, what exactly is your take on the sector as a whole and Patni Computers in particular? 
  
  The sector is very mixed right now. The most defensive stock in the sector Infosys is I think attracting a little bit of buying. It is just staying in a line. It is not really going up or down but its holding out nicely but there are stocks which are beginning to look weak. I would particularly highlight Patni which I have put as a short. MphasiS which has also been weakening. So you got a few stocks which are getting a little shaky. HCL technologies which you just mentioned. So situations are pointing to a mixed bag in IT, the defensives probably could do well when people are a little nervous about the market. The others could be a little volatile on the downside.

ET Now: What is it that you have made of the big pharma deal, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy and how would you approach the pharma space now?   Vijai Mantri: We have been overweight on pharma for a considerable period of time and what we have been telling for last one and a half year is that in any sector of the economy, the weaker player, the weakness could be for any reason are going to give way to the stronger player and we have seen same thing playing out in pharma industry.
 
 So it will be company specific. Even a small company doing very well, has well entrenched business model, then I do not see any significant risk to that company, however there is a possibility on the midcap space where some pharma companies would like to cash out and the kind of cash they get if the entire company gets sold out could be quite substantial.
 
 Many companies on midcap and the small cap on the pharma side has been promoted by promoters who are their mid 50s or 60s and they would like to cash out. So that kind of situation may happen but in large cap space as things stand, we do not see more consolidation happening because most of the players actually are well entrenched as on date."

 IndiGo is preparing to file documents for an initial public offering within the next 60 days, aiming to raise $400 million by selling a 10% stake, said a person familiar with the matter. That would give the airline promoted by Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises and aviation industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal a valuation of Rs 25,200 crore.
 
 This valuation is higher than what some industry officials expected. Comparatively, Jet Airways had a market capitalisation of Rs 3,242 crore at the close of trading on Tuesday and SpiceJet was valued at Rs 1,115 crore.
 
 IndiGo’s president Aditya Ghosh declined to comment on the company’s IPO plans. Although there has been talk of an IndiGo IPO since middle of last year, the airline has been looking to get its timing ""just right,"" the person said, without elaborating.
 
 The company will file a comprehensive IPO proposal known as a red herring prospectus with the Securities & Exchange Board of India, the capital markets regulator. Sebi usually takes 6-8 months to approve such documents, which means IndiGo’s IPO may possibly be pushed to next year.
 
 
CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE
 
 Investors have been looking forward to share sale primarily because IndiGo has been consistently profitable over the past few years. An IPO would enable investors to get astake in what is arguably the biggest success of India’s aviation industry, which has seen carriers such as Air Deccan and Kingfisher Airlines unable to sustain operations amid increasing competition, high costs and fare wars.
 

 IndiGo’s profit before tax in the financial year ended March 31 rose more than three-fold from Rs 477 crore in the previous year, the person said. The airline is yet to file its results with the Registrar of Companies. Its net profit in FY14 more than halved toRs 317 crore due to rising fuel costs and price wars. Consultant CAPA India pegged IndiGo’s net profit for FY15 at $175 million (Rs 1,111.6 crore).
 
 The airline has told its bankers it has cash of more than $1 billion.
 
 GoAir, the only other Indian airline that’s been profitable, posted earnings of Rs 50 crore in FY14. Jet Airways posted a consolidated annual loss ofRs 2,097.41 crore in FY15 compared with Rs 4,129.76 crore a year earlier. SpiceJet swung to a net profit of Rs 22.52 crore in January-March 2015 after seven straight loss-making quarters.
 
 
MAY OUTPERFORM PEERS
 
 Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises holds about 51% of IndiGo’s paid-up capital and US-based Gangwal’s Caelum Investment LLC owns about 48%. The remainder is held by Bhatia in his personal capacity, his wife Rohini Bhatia, his father Kapil Bhatia, Gangwal’s wife Shobha Gangwal and her sister Asha Mukherjee.
 
 IndiGo had a market share of 39% in May while Jet Airways and its subsidiary JetLite accounted for 21.5%, according to figures from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. SpiceJet had a 12% share.
 
 IndiGo has weathered the downturn in the aviation industry in the past few years better than its rivals and is expected to outperform them now that the sector is looking at an upswing. Domestic air traffic grew 13.9% last year while international passenger numbers increased 9%. The CAPA report said Indian carriers’ losses in this financial year are likely to narrow 40% to over $1.25 billion.
 
 IndiGo currently has a fleet of 97 Airbus A320-200s and has placed an order for 180 more A320 neos (new engine options) with deliveries likely to start at the end of this calendar year. It signed a pact in October for a record 250 planes. The airline also has exercise rights or options for 100 more aircraft.
 
 Last year, Jet Airways was valued at $1.58 billion (Rs 9,500 crore) by Etihad Airways, which bought a 24% stake in the airline for $379 million. The shares were valued at a 32% premium to their market price. Ajay Singh recently bought a 58.46% stake in SpiceJet with a pledge to infuseRs 1,500 crore in the airline."

Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO, 
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co Ltd.
 
 Talking to 
Sanjeev Sinha, Singhel says that risk-based pricing and not succumbing to market pressure will be beneficial for the industry in the long run. Excerpts from an exclusive interview:
 
 
Q1) What, according to you, are some of the challenges that the insurance industry is facing today? What are the emerging areas in the industry?
 
 India is a vast country with over 5000 cities and towns. However, lack of proper infrastructure is the biggest bottleneck faced by the industry in reaching out and tapping the enormous potential offered by these towns and villages. This under penetration is also due to a lack of financial awareness, complex products and wordings, low-perceived benefits and propensity to purchase based on reactive drivers like insistence by financers of home, business or personal loans or statutory requirements.
 
 Besides, the Indian insurance industry is still a fiercely competitive market with intense pricing pressures. The industry needs to correct pricing. Risk based pricing and not succumbing to market pressure will be beneficial for the industry in the long run. We are in the business of paying claims where profitability implies a strong financial position and the ability to honor claims.
 
 One of the most significant emerging trends in the industry is digital transformation. Insurance companies today are harnessing digitization and mobile technology to improve distribution and processes, empower and engage with customers and also for analytics that will help in detecting frauds. Besides digitization one of the positive trends in the industry is the rise in sale of retail health insurance policies. We hope that this trend continues and strengthens in the future.
 
 
Q2) How is technology playing a role these days in customer acquisition as well as new product development and market expansion?
 
 Technology has changed the traditional buying behavior of consumers even when it comes to financial instruments. Today, they are looking at ease of use, convenience and instant TAT (Turn Around Time). Besides, social media chatter has started influencing purchase decisions. The industry has embraced this mega trend and is increasingly using digital capabilities to acquire and engage with the consumer and other eco-system participants. Insurers are increasingly introducing self-service platforms, mobile apps and tablet based solutions to attract and retain customers. Today, we at Bajaj Allianz are using social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook as well as the popular messenger service Whatsapp to engage with our existing customers and reach out to new customers.
 
 Since technology has changed the way consumers make a purchase, insurers are now looking at creating products that are simple, involve minimal documentation and are more transparent so that it is easier for the consumer to make informed decisions and faster purchases. However, we still have some ground to cover on the product development front.
 
 Digitized distribution models are helping us reach the customers' doorsteps with insurance solutions as well as remote areas that were earlier uncovered. We at Bajaj Allianz have been able to reach out to 200 new markets last year due to our key initiative called Virtual Office. Virtual Office is an entire office run on a tablet via various applications. We are slowly trying to do away with the brick and mortar model.
 
 
Q3) Mis-selling and fraud are a common practice in the industry. What are the ways to curb them?
 
 Mis-selling and frauds have been an issue for the entire industry. Apart from creating dedicated cells in the company, digitized touch points and simpler and transparent products in future will help curb these practices. Today, data analytics is also proving to be an effective tool in the prevention of frauds. It helps identify and detect fraudulent patterns and triggers which help the claims team refer all such cases for investigation. Mis-selling will decline with an increase in digital sales interactions, clear communication and efforts by all players in the ecosystem to increase consumer awareness through all available forums. Social media must also be used for this purpose.
 
 
Q4) Your company had launched an all-women branch in Pune some time back. What was rationale behind it and what has been the customer response so far? Do you also plan to have more such branches going ahead?
 
 Realizing the large and untapped potential women offer, we came up with this platform - a dedicated branch to offer opportunities to women professionals, especially those who had to leave their careers due to family or personal commitments. The all-women insurance branches recruit and train only female agents and intermediaries. We launched a pilot project in Pune to gauge its acceptance and workability. The project received an encouraging response in terms of participation and the revenue generated. Therefore, we have now replicated it in cities across India. Today, with 30 established branches and some more planned across the country, it is a key strategic initiative of the company. We have also set up a support system for our women agents by providing them with an all-female staff, crèches, flexible working hours etc. We believe that with their unique qualities of empathy, patience and their attachment to issues related to health and home, women we will be able to drive insurance product lines related to these.
 
 
 
 
Q5) How are you planning to grow the different segments, particularly health, automobile and home?
 
 In the Indian automobile insurance space we are one of the leading insurers. To accelerate growth, our main aim will be to increase our reach, especially in the Tier 2 and 3 cities, by expanding our distribution network. We will also be focusing on the two wheeler segment.
 
 In the home and health insurance space, growth drivers would be:
 
 # Tapping new markets mainly in the remote corners of the country. # Awareness drives especially for home insurance, given that the penetration is dismal across the country. # Coming out with simpler, innovative and need-based product variants. Product innovation in health and home segments has helped our growth in these lines earlier too. For instance, Bajaj Allianz All Risk Home Insurance policy, a unique product launched last year with features that were introduced for the very first time in the Indian market, saw great response from the consumers. # Capitalizing on the existing channels by cross selling and up-selling. # Integrating with online aggregators and participating in government-driven schemes. # Most importantly, providing consumers with value addition.
 
 
 
 
Q6) What is your focus as the insurance industry is going through a slowdown phase currently?
 
 In the non-life space the slowdown was due to the unviable pricing and drop in sales in the auto-industry given that a large proportion of premium comes from the motor segment. However, we are now witnessing some growth given the rise in automobile sales and measures taken by the regulator to correct pricing in the industry. Meanwhile, our energies are focused on strengthening our home and health portfolios as well as distribution capabilities. An incremental effort on these fronts will positively impact our growth. Additionally, initiatives by the new government at the Centre, such as PMSBY, Smart cities, Digitalization, Make in India and Financial inclusion, will contribute towards economic and industrial growth, which in turn will lead to sustainable growth of the industry.
 
 
Q7) Are you planning to launch any new product or enter a new segment? 
 
 The industry today needs simple de-jargonized products that are easy to comprehend and purchase. Last year we introduced 3 new unique products - 2 in the health insurance space and 1 in the home insurance space, which received great response. Going forward, our focus in the product domain will be on creating simpler and transparent products that can be easily bought online and via mobile platforms. Last year we also ventured into the agriculture insurance market and till date have covered over 27 lakh farmers across various states in the country. Going forward we are looking at participating in the various weather-based insurance schemes proposed by the government and providing security net to a large farmer base.
 
 Besides, we will be exploring opportunities to provide more value additions beyond insurance along with our products. Currently, we provide over 20 value-added services with our health and motor insurance products.
 
 
Q8) What are your other plans and growth targets?
 
 Improving our penetration when it comes to personal lines of business is the key goal. Apart from this, we have 4 main focus areas which will play a key role in achieving our growth targets.
 
 # Distribution Transformation: Just as the government aims to reach the remotest corners of the country, our aim too is to take insurance to every city, town and village of our nation and reach out to around 300 new markets by the end of this financial year.
 
 # Customer Centricity: Delivering superior value with an excellent and caring experience for the customer. Most important would be providing ease and convenience with priority given to claims, billing and policy processing. Our mobile app 'Insurance Wallet' is a step in this direction.
 
 # Digital by Default: Every process to be digital, empowering customers and channel partners with low cost mobile solutions. Make our claim settlement procedures even more efficient in order to further reduce TAT on claim settlement for all lines of businesses.
 
 # Relationship Beyond Insurance: As insurers we want to establish a clear leadership in engaging with our customers beyond insurance. Currently, we provide a host of services like 24 X 7 free road side assistance for women, discounts on wellness services, apps that give access to online pharmacies and doctors on call, to name a few. Going forward we want to further innovate on this front. For instance, given the busy lifestyles that we live today, can we look at providing our customers with electrical or plumbing solutions as a value addition along with home insurance solutions?"

"Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs global commodities research head, called gold crash right",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/jeffrey-currie-goldman-sachss-global-commodities-research-head-called-gold-crash-right/articleshow/19625761.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs’s global commodities research head, called gold crash right","Goldman Sachs’s Jeffrey Currie got ahead of gold’s biggest collapse since 1980 last week because he saw two signals most others missed. Prices that had risen for 12 straight years as investors sought a haven asset failed to rally amid turmoil in Cyprus.

Gold holdings in exchange traded funds tumbled at a time when interest rates remained low. Currie, the bank’s 46-year-old global commodities research head with a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, issued his sell recommendation on April 10, before gold fell 13% in a two-session plunge that ended on April 15, the biggest decline in 33 years.

Morgan Stanley and Bank of America followed Goldman, and the slump wiped out almost $1 billion of hedge fund manager John Paulson’s personal wealth.

“You had a whole group of observations that should have created a substantial rally in gold prices, but they didn’t,” Currie said by telephone from New York. “The fact that gold did not rally on Cyprus amid the bad US data that occurred in that time period created the conviction we needed.”

Cyprus Levy

Gold rose 1% in the week after March 16 when Cyprus announced an unprecedented levy on bank deposits, before erasing gains the following two weeks.

The country’s finance minister said on April 14 it may sell gold reserves to get international aid, helping extend a slump this week after the metal fell into a bear market April 12.

Bullion capped a record annual run last year as nations pledged more stimulus to bolster economic growth. Currie, who manages a team of 11 research analysts, first cut the bank’s outlook for gold prices in December, and then again in February, before recommending a short position on April 10.

The bank’s 12-month forecast is for prices to reach $1,390 an ounce. The target for the end of 2014 is $1,270 and prices may drop below $1,200 temporarily, he said.

Paulson Outlook

Gold’s price drop hasn’t changed billionaire Paulson’s intermediate to long-term outlook on the precious metal, said John Reade, partner and global strategist at Paulson & Co in New York in a statement on April 15. Bond buying by governments will increase demand for gold even as the commodity is “going through one of its periodic adjustments”.

Currie’s correct gold recommendation came as he celebrated his 17th year at Goldman Sachs on April 15. He joined the bank after earning his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1996, and became a managing director in 2002 and partner in 2008. He moved to the New York office last year from London, where he worked since 2003 and served as European co-head of economics, commodities and strategy research from 2010 to 2012.

Investors who followed Currie’s recommendation on gold would have earned returns of about 12% — not the best call he’s ever made. In 2007, he made a bullish recommendation on oil that yielded 23%. The price of crude touched a 19-month low in January 2007 in New York before surging to a record $147.27 a barrel in July the next year.

Another bullish recommendation on a basket of commodities in 2011 yielded 23%, while a bet on higher oil in 2012 lost 36%. In 2007, “it was much more of a contrarian call” than the recent one, Currie said.

	 


“We were fighting the tape in the sense that you had a substantial pullback in commodity prices into the first quarter of 2007. This time, if you look at a chart, gold was trending downward consistently, so this was less of a contrarian call than ones we’ve made in the past.”

While futures averaged a record $1,671 last year, prices were already in a five-month slump through February that was the worst since 1997 and a month before Goldman Sachs advised selling the metal.

Gold is now 28% below its September 2011 record. Not all of Currie’s recommended trades are winners. The bet on higher copper prices that was recommended on March 1 has lost about $498 a tonne, according to an April 16 report from the bank.

Global Market

Currie, who lives in Fairfield, Connecticut, said he travels 132 days out of the year. Members of his research team are based in New York, London, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.

“Unlike equities which are by definition regional, commodities are truly a global market,” Currie said. “That’s one reason why I’m on the road so much, because of that. It’s predominantly corporate players in the market, so I’m not going to places like Boston or Zurich. We’re going to places like Lagos and Johannesburg, as opposed to where the investors are.”"

ET Now: What happens if DIIs stop buying into domestic equities? What if they decide to pull the plug?
 
 
Kunj Bansal: Healthy liquidity is critical to the market's performance. A lot of midcaps have fallen in the last few days due to drying up of liquidity.
 
 One must note that the impact of this reducing liquidity has been felt more on mid and smallcap counters. For largecaps, it is not a major concern so far.
 
 Overall, I must say that liquidity is a critical requirement for any buying as well as selling. Hence, what you are saying actually applies when there are people falling over each other to buy...
 
ET Now: Are you shopping right now or are you conserving cash?
 
 
Kunj Bansal: We are buying. We are regularly buying wherever we have cash or wherever we are getting inflows from our investors.

If that were to happen that should clearly add a lot of momentum to the Nifty, the good thing is that while the initial part of the Bank Nifty was being triggered by private sector banks like Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank. Now, the PSU banks have started to show some kind of traction on the upside and have started participated in the rally so that is where we are trading with some kind of long bias  	If the Bank Nifty breaks below 15550 then you would again want to possibly reduce and cut down your long exposure and wait for the breakout to eventually happen. But for the time being it does look like that the breakout is on its way and will possibly happen by the end of the trading day today."
Multi Commodity Exchange signs new technology contract with Financial Technologies India Ltd,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/multi-commodity-exchange-signs-new-technology-contract-with-financial-technologies-india-ltd/articleshow/43810983.cms,m.economictimes.com,Multi Commodity Exchange signs new technology contract with Financial Technologies India Ltd,"MUMBAI: Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) today said it has entered into a new agreement with Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) for availing software support and managed services till 2022. 

 The pact (supplementary agreement), inked on mutually agreed terms, marks continuation of technology partnership between the two companies, founded by entrepreneur Jignesh Shah, and comes as a shot in the arm for the commodity bourse as it seeks to launch fresh contracts. 

 In a filing to the BSE, MCX said the agreement was entered into with several changes. 

 As per the new agreement, MCX will pay FTIL a fixed charge of Rs 1.5 crore per month, including managed services payable in advance on semi-annual basis. Earlier, it was paying Rs 2 crore per month. 

 FTIL will also get a variable charge of 10.3 per cent of gross transaction fees as compared to 12.5 per cent earlier. 

 Last week, FTIL said it has signed a 10-year long technology contract with the commodity exchange (the new one is for 8 years), resulting in negative impact of nearly Rs 9 crore on its total income for this fiscal. 

 The Jignesh Shah-led company said, ""Due to this supplementary agreement, and based on the current volume of MCX and assuming MCX daily volume remains same, the negative impact on the total income of the company would be around Rs 8.82 crore for the period of 2014-15."" 

 In 2013-14, MCX paid about Rs 60 crore to FTIL for receiving technological support and services. The new pact will pave the way for MCX to launch new contracts for January to March period of 2015. 

 MCX is confident that it will be allowed to launch all its contracts for the year 2015 once the full divestment by FTIL of its stake in MCX takes place in compliance with sector regulator FMC's order. 

 On September 17, the commodity markets watchdog said the exchange can launch new contracts for first three months of 2015 after if it signs a fresh technology deal with FTIL. 

 FTIL had said that by entering into the new agreement, it has completed all formalities to close its sale of 15 per cent stake in MCX to Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

 FMC had said the exchange will be allowed to roll out contracts for entire 2015 once the full divestment of FTIL in MCX takes place as per the regulatory norms."

ET Now: I believe you will agree that private banks are not exactly cheap, sure enough some of them maybe but a lot of them are trading at highs that leaves the PSU banks, will there be clear money running into PSU banks and if so, would it be restricted to the top tier ones or would it find waves across the spectrum?  

 
Amit Shah: Let us talk about two parts of money – one is offshore money coming into India which will come in larger quantum and one is onshore money which is typical retail, HNI money which would get invested in and if you look their psyche, for foreign investor the first and foremost important thing for him is liquidity, that if I invest into this stuff, will I able to exit or not. So by that logic, the first round of allocation will come into more liquid stocks compared to more illiquid stocks which are typically of mid and small cap. 

 
ET Now: The likes of SBI, etc, you think will find favour.  

 
Amit Shah: Correct and then obviously private banks. Now private banks have its own challenges as you would be hearing in media HDFC has an issue where HDFC Bank limits are more or less there so the allocation has gone down, but given a choice obviously companies which are liquid is where the money would flow in. 

 If we see a stable government, in that scenario the first and the foremost thing the government would do or should do is essentially try and improve your banking system because that is a core to any kind of growth because any dollar coming in converts into $10 going out because of the money supply effect and I do not think so it is a difficult thing to do, it is a long term process but if you have a will one can do it and the classic example is if you look at power distribution companies in state of Gujarat, the way non-profitable structure has become so profitable, so the good part about India is we have policy framework in place which just need implementation in the right spirit and if government is determined, the core asset drivers which is a bank, infrastructure if they have that due attention and the balance sheets are helped to cleaned up, the growth numbers there can quite significant."
Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-likely-to-start-flat-on-muhurat-trading-day-may-reclaim-8k/articleshow/44917232.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat-to-higher on Thursday on the first day of Samvat 2071 tracking muted trend across global markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to head higher later in the session to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8000.
 
 US and majority of Asian markets ended on a muted note in trade as a shooting at the Canadian parliament unnerved investors, which triggered profit booking across markets.
 
 Today’s trading also marks the starting of Samvat 2071. It is considered auspicious to start something new on this date and for the same reason, many traders in the stock market too, make token purchase of shares, say analysts.
 
 Samvat 2070 has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The S&P BSE Sensex clocked returns of over 26 per cent in the same period.
 
 Nifty added 68 points to its values and ended at 7995 on Wednesday, whereas the Sensex ended higher by 0.80 per cent or 211 points at 26787.
 
 Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com is of the view that ‘Muhurat Trading’ session would only be a truncated. It might not do much to the index, but on the stock specific side, you could see some action happening, he added.
 
 Nifty cleared the short term resistance of 7970 level on Wednesday on closing basis. Now, the level of 8040 would act as a key resistance to watch out for in the immediate term, say analysts.
 
 ""If 8040 is surpasses we may see some further upside; however, higher up the next resistance is placed at 8090 - 8120 range,"" GEPL Capital said in a report.
 
 ""On the lower side, the immediate support is now placed at 7970 followed by 7930. It is very important that the index takes support in the range of 7970 to 7930 in case of a decline, else we may see resumption of the recent down trend that has come in force after it violated a key support of 7840 in the past week,"" added the report."

However, even this time the Nifty couldn’t cross its resistance mark. In the past couple of sessions, it is consolidating in a narrow range of 6000-6200. This is in sync with what open interest data for Nifty options indicates. Maximum OI is placed at 6000 put and on call side the same is at 6200 call. 

 F&O rollovers for the November series are strong, with both Nifty and the market witnessing above-average rolls percentage against average for the past three F&O expiries. However, this can also be attributed to lower OI base for the current month series. Rollover costs (cost to long rolls) have been shrinking since the past 2-3 trading sessions, which indicates that shorts are more aggressive in rolling their positions. We expect the November F&O series expiry in Nifty between 6050 and 6100. 

 The sentiment indicator, India Volatility Index (VIX) has been rising slowly as we are coming closer to state election dates. We believe if VIX breaches 21.5-22% range then it can test 26-28%. We will assign 70% probability for VIX to break out in coming days before the assembly election results on December 8. 

 In order to play this view we recommend generating a long straddle in Nifty at 6100 strike. The strategy is to buy 6100 strike call and put of December series, with outflow of 270-275 points. This strategy will make money if we see extreme moves on either side along with increase in implied volatility (IVs)."
"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/polls-could-be-a-big-swing-factor-for-indian-market-says-hsbc/articleshow/25992731.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC","NEW DELHI: The general elections could prove to be a ""big swing factor"" for the Indian stock market going ahead, financial services major HSBC said while putting a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014. 

 The Indian market has seen a modest gain of 8 per cent in the current year, but underperformed significantly in US dollar terms as the Indian rupee depreciated sharply in the second half of the year, the company said. 

 According to HSBC, the ""storm has abated"" for the Indian markets as the US Fed has deferred tapering of its quantitative easing stimulus, and as the new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has taken steps to contain the rupee fall. 

 However, ""structural imbalances and the election uncertainty should keep the outlook for 2014 clouded"", HSBC said. 

 ""We expect Indian equities to deliver a below average return of 3 per cent in 2014, while earnings should grow by 8-10 per cent,"" the HSBC report said. 

 ""We are underweight India within the region context with a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014,"" it added. 

 According to the global brokerage major, the upcoming general elections could be a ""big swing factor"" and an ""inflection point"" for the Indian markets. 

 ""In our view, if BJP-led National Democratic Alliance comes to the power, it would be positive for infrastructure -led sectors, while a Congress-led UPA government would be positive for consumption-led sectors,"" it said. 

 The report further said: ""Indian infrastructure spending is likely to rebound whoever wins next year's general election. We see capital goods companies growing profits by 15 per cent in calender year 2014"". 

 ""We prefer to play the market via export-oriented sectors, such as IT and healthcare, which benefit from a weak rupee, or USD proxy plays, such as energy. We are cautious on consumer discretionary, real estate and state-owned banks,"" it added. 

 Moreover, earnings estimates for IT and healthcare companies are likely to be upgraded on the back of sharp currency depreciation.

At 07:45 am, Nifty50 futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 11.50 points higher at 7,945, indicating a flat opening in the domestic market. 	  	Asian markets were trading mixed. Japanese Nikkei was trading 0.42 per cent lower at 19,860. China's Shanghai Composite was down 0.72 per cent at 3,609.  	Among other Asian indices, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.64 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi (up 0.11 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.38 per cent) were trading higher.  	The business and consumer climate data for the euro zone will be released later in the day. Britain will report its preliminary GDP numbers for the September quarter. In India, weekly foreign reserve data will be released. It will also be the first day of the December series futures and options contracts.  	But all eyes will be on the ongoing winter session of Parliament. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Thursday to pay tribute to sitting member Khekiho Zhimomi of Nagaland People's Front, who had passed away earlier in the day.  	""My sense is that the initial phase will be noisy, but the House will get down to business at some point. Once things get to that level, there will definitely be discussions on GST, because it is on top of the government's to-do list. The government will make sure that there is some discussion. One does hope to see the GST bill passed during this session,"" said C Jayaram, Joint Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank. 	Investors will also keep an eye on the dollar-rupee exchange rate and foreign flows trends.  	The rupee closed at an 11-week low of 66.57 on Thursday amid a sharp appreciation in the greenback globally on a likely shift in the policy stance by the US Fed in the December policy review. Hopes that the Fed may hike interest rate in the next policy review have triggered outflows from emerging markets. India has been no exception and has witnessed an outflow of Rs 6,348-odd crore so far in November.    	Market experts say even as the chances of a Fed liftoff in December policy are high, the next rate hike may not happen in 2016, as it will be the year of US presidential elections.  	""Fed feels it needs to be seen to be responsible. It almost never raised interest rates during an election cycle and the election cycle in the US will really start in six weeks. So, we should not expect to have much of a rate hike in 2016,"" said Paul Schulte, Schulte Research.  	Technical charts suggest rangebound trading ahead for Nifty50.  	""For Friday, I expect the market to remain sideways with a positive bias. The 7,800 and 7,920 levels on Nifty50 would be my range,"" said Sandeep Wagle of Power My Wealth.   	Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com said if Nifty50 breaks below 7,820, it would force him to cut long exposure and look aggressively to short some individual names.  	""But yes, from a stock-specific point of view, midcaps as well as some individual names have been buzzing. They are clearly seeing breakouts and some kind of good follow-up buying. So, maybe, one should focus on them with long positions,"" Thacker said."

Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/private-placement-to-30-million-investors-wonders-sebis-chief-u-k-sinha/articleshow/21102546.cms,m.economictimes.com,Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,"NEW DELHI: Taking a veiled jibe at Sahara group, market regulator Sebi's Chairman U K Sinha today said a large company collected $4-5 billion from more than 30 million investors and claimed it was a 'private placement'.
 
 Sinha also said that the first regulatory agency that comes to people's mind is Sebi, whenever the issue comes to fore about investor protection in cases of deposit-taking by unathourised schemes.
 
 Without naming Sahara group, Sinha gave example of ""a large company"", which raised more than $4 to 5 billion from more than 30 million investors.
 
 ""And the company claims it was a private placement. Now, how a private placement can reach out to 30 million people is another question?"" Sinha wondered.
 
 As per the Sebi rules and the Companies Act, a private placement is defined as issuance of shares or other securities to a maximum of 49 persons and anything involving 50 or more investors is considered a public offer.
 
 Sebi has been engaged in a long-running case with Sahara group over refund of more than Rs 24,000 crore (about $ five billion) collected by two Sahara companies from more than three crore investors through issue of certain bonds.
 
 Saharas were asked by the Supreme Court last year to deposit the money to Sebi for further refund to investors after verifying their genuineness and the market regulator recently initiated a process for the refund.
 
 However, Saharas have deposited only Rs 5,120 crore with Sebi and have claimed that more than Rs 20,000 crore they have already refunded directly to the bondholders. The case is scheduled for further hearing by the apex court tomorrow.
 
 Speaking at a venture capital conference here, Sebi chief said that the regulator's aim is to protect the interests of investors and focus on corporate governance.
 
 ""When some company, which was not even registered with Sebi, raised money from ordinary investors in the country, for example in West Bengal, people started blaming Sebi.
 
 ""It is not one company and there are multiple companies that raised money from large number of investors. The perception was that money is lost,"" Sinha said, while adding that Sebi always steps in to safeguard investors' interest.
 
 ""So, we are accountable, as the first agency which comes to anybody's mind is, if there is any issue about investor protection, that's Sebi. We have to be careful about that,"" he said."

The company currently derives a bulk of its Rs 21,000-crore turnover from manufacturing and selling jewellery to retailers in the local as well as export markets. 

 The company intends to increase its retail outlets to 125 from 73 stores currently in Karnataka by the end of April 2012 and a total of 550 stores across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala by the end of 2014. For this, it intends to raise Rs 2,500 crore through external commercial borrowing (ECB), Rs 2,000 crore through internal accruals and Rs 2,000 crore through supplier's credit. The proceeds from the ECB will be used to buy gold, said Mehta. 

 The company imports gold dore, or impure gold, from mines overseas and manufactures jewellery at its Bangalore headquarters. ""Since we are fully integrated, we will be able to cut down the supply chain and offer gold jewellery 10-20% cheaper than our rivals,"" claimed Mehta. 

 The company follows an associate model for its retail foray, refurbishing existing stores of jewellers who apply to become its associates and stocking it with its own inventory. The day-to-day cost of the establishment is to be borne by the associates but Rajesh Exports bears the advertising cost apart from providing inventory."

  Deepak Mohoni, Director, trendwatchindia.com in an interview with ET Now talks about refinery stocks.
  
  
  Let us get your view on the refiners because I have read a couple of reports that seem to feel that really quite sceptical about the fact that the government will indeed do something which will really be meaningful in terms of giving a boost to bottom line for all of these companies technically how do they look?
  
  At the moment they are obviously with that bit of a sell off yesterday and the day before they are under pressure but it would appear to be short term pressure because all these companies are very much just a little bit below their highs especially Bharat Petroleum they are life time highs. 
  
  Now, they are not too many stocks in the market which are really there so given that the long term trend in these stocks are stable but one thing to remember about these stocks is they go up during market downtrends and they fall during uptrends and this is exactly what is happening again. Primarily related to the trend in crude oil price, crude oil tends to go up with the markets and these stocks tend to go down with crude oil so that's really what has been happening here.

 Tendulkar and Warne are in the US as captains of an inaugural all-star line-up of 28 cricket legends from across the world for the first ever 'Cricket All Stars' series in the US. 

 Tendulkar and Warne will visit the stock exchange to highlight the inaugural cricket series which will take place in New York, Houston and Los Angeles. They will ring the opening bell at 9:30m New York time that will mark the start of the trading day. 

 The historic tour marks the first time Tendulkar and Warne will play on US soil. 

 The 'Cricket All-Stars' kicks off on November 7 at Citi Field in New York City with a special opening ceremony prior to the match as well as other functions and galas. 

 The second match will be on November 11 in Houston and the final match in the series will be on November 14 in Los Angeles, followed by a special trophy presentation to the winning team. 

 In the past, several Indian dignitaries, including political leaders and businessmen, have rung the opening and closing bell at the stock exchange and at NASDAQ. 

 Given that cricket is not a popular sport in America, it is the first time that cricketers will ring the ceremonial bell at the stock exchange. 

 Through extensive promotions and media appearances, Tendulkar said the idea behind the series is not only to popularise the game in America but to globalise it as there is need to have more countries play the sport competitively in tournaments like the World Cup. 

 ""The reason for picking up a cricket bat again after retirement is to globalise cricket. That is a dream and vision Warne and I have. One day we would like the American (cricket) team also to participate in the World Cup. It would be a great moment. All cricketers have also been endorsing for having cricket in the Olympics. This is the beginning,"" Tendulkar told reporters yesterday."
Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-wants-bourses-to-provide-a-level-playing-field-for-hft-traders/articleshow/33577070.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi wants stock exchanges in India to provide a level playing field for traders who use high frequency trading (HFT) through co-location and those without the facility. 

 The debate over the use of HFT has resurfaced after the recent release of Michael Lewis’ book Flash Boys, which is critical of the system. The discussion within Sebi is that stock exchanges should implement its guidelines issued last year, which states there should be a two-queue system for orders coming from co-location and other mode. 

 Such an architecture will provide orders generated from a space not co-located a fair chance of execution and address concerns related to being crowded-out by orders placed from co-location, a Sebi official said. 

 Co-location is like proximity hosting, where the exchange hosts the subscriber’s server at its data centre near the master trading engine and helps in faster movement of data and execution of trades. Not all traders can use co-location as setting up the infrastructure involves huge costs. Both National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the BSE do not follow any separate queue system currently. 

 The two-queue system would ensure stockbrokers who are not co-located have a fair and equitable access to the stock exchange’s trading systems, said Sebi. The regulator had said distribution ratio of orders from terminals/servers that are not co-located to the orders from co-located servers may be kept at 1:1 and, in future, it may be reviewed based on the feedback from market participants. 

 ""Conceptually, I am not against such a system,"" said Rajesh Baheti, managing director of Mumbai-based Crosseas Capital, one of the largest domestic arbitrageurs using HFT. ""It should be seen if such technology is possible and the results should be measurable."" 

 Lewis argues in his book that the $23-trillion US stock market is rigged in favour of HFT traders, who prey on slower investors by getting early access to non-public information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US is already probing potential criminal activity associated with HFT. 

 On April 4, US attorney general Eric Holder said the justice department is investigating whether HFT violates insider-trading laws. Many other brokers believe the debate over HFT versus non-HFT is a question of market integrity. ""Many private investors do not participate as their orders are executed at a slower speed during events or major news. They believe that markets are rigged against them,"" said a Delhi-based broker. 

 The NSE did not comment on the issue. The BSE said it will continue to implement all Sebi policies in earnest and currently it does not give any priority to HFT traders in terms of information or matching of orders. But then sources close to NSE say the exchange, too, does not allow order matching on priority basis to HFT traders and they get matched as and when they come. 

 As per the latest data on NSE, HFT constitutes 17.15 per cent of the overall trading volumes. HF proponents say Sebi’s suggestion cannot be implemented. ""People will stop co-locating,"" said Hirander Misra, CEO, Global Markets Exchange Group. 

 ""Co-location is mainly for time priority. It gives liquidity to markets with high number of passive orders. If you say orders that come first may not go first, then people will stop using it. Separate order queues will close down co-location."""

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: In the near term though, does it seem like there are any indications of the market getting overheated? Does it seem like the rally could pause - not because of us, but because of the global developments at play right now? 

 
Arindam Ghosh: India has a strong chance of getting de-coupled and the probability of that getting pronounced is going to be incrementally high, because of both domestic and global factors at play. 

 I can point out three domestic factors at this point. One is inflation, which is coming off at a trajectory much sharper than what it was originally estimated to be. Secondly, we are closer than earlier to turn in the monetary cycle. Lastly, growth is definitely showing steady signs of pickup. 

 Add to this the windfall of the global factor in terms of international crude prices, and India looks to be the second best market after US. 

 Hence, irrespective of what happens globally, we really do not anticipate any over-the-cliff kind of a situation. Nevertheless, even in an environment where growth has actually been slowing down, we have the Eurozone which is faltering and we have emerging markets which is battling a slowdown in growth and monetary tightening. 

 On the other hand, you have India, which is actually in a very sweet spot. India will keep on getting more than proportionate share of the allocation when it comes to global and regional allocations. Barring any geopolitical escalation - which is always a possibility - we feel that India, over the long term, definitely looks to be on the up.

Nandkumar Surti: PSUs are closer to the government and they will be impacted, but there are a lot of private sector companies which are also going to be impacted by government policies. 

 However in general, it is expected of this current government that they will improve the efficiencies of the PSU stocks and so there is a lot of positivity around PSU stocks at this point of time. 

 But at the same time, policy decisions are going to equally affect the private sector and I guess they will also benefit from the current government’s policies.

This underperformance could be attributed to the lower margins reflected in the third quarter results of the company. 
  
  At a time when small- sized construction firms have reported a net profit margin of 4-5%, Simplex Infrastructure reported a net profit margin of 1.1% in the quarter ending December 2011. This is due to a foreign exchange loss of 3.3 crore and one-time start-up cost for a few projects. 
  
  Another reason for lower profits is high debt. At the end of September 2011, the company had a debt to equity ratio of 1.64. This is higher in comparison to its peers such as Unity Infra Projects and Pratibha Industries, which have a debt to equity ratio of 1.1 each. 
  
  As a result, a significant amount of the company's operating profits is used for servicing debt. In the December 2011 quarter, its interest expense was 42% to its operating profits. 
  
  In the coming quarters, a strong order book would help the company in allaying these concerns. The company has a healthy order book of 14,441 crore, which is nearly three times its FY11 revenues. 
  
  At a time when most construction companies are facing a dearth of new orders, Simplex Infrastructure has been able to secure nearly 4,162 crore worth of orders in the first nine months of this financial year. One of the main reasons for securing new orders is its execution capability. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Besides, the company's working capital days have also improved in the last few months. Its working capital days improved from 136 days in September 2011 to 120 days in December 2011 quarter, a reflection of the fact that the company has managed its working capital quite effectively in a high interest rate regime. 
  
  Also the fact that the company's order book is well-diversified, helps it weather any slowdown in one particular sector. Of the total order book of 14,441 crore, the company has an exposure of close to 27% to construction activities related to buildings and housing, followed by 26% in power, 11% in roads, and 14% in industrial sectors. On a trailing twelve months basis, the company is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 9.6."

 The pact (supplementary agreement), inked on mutually agreed terms, marks continuation of technology partnership between the two companies, founded by entrepreneur Jignesh Shah, and comes as a shot in the arm for the commodity bourse as it seeks to launch fresh contracts. 

 In a filing to the BSE, MCX said the agreement was entered into with several changes. 

 As per the new agreement, MCX will pay FTIL a fixed charge of Rs 1.5 crore per month, including managed services payable in advance on semi-annual basis. Earlier, it was paying Rs 2 crore per month. 

 FTIL will also get a variable charge of 10.3 per cent of gross transaction fees as compared to 12.5 per cent earlier. 

 Last week, FTIL said it has signed a 10-year long technology contract with the commodity exchange (the new one is for 8 years), resulting in negative impact of nearly Rs 9 crore on its total income for this fiscal. 

 The Jignesh Shah-led company said, ""Due to this supplementary agreement, and based on the current volume of MCX and assuming MCX daily volume remains same, the negative impact on the total income of the company would be around Rs 8.82 crore for the period of 2014-15."" 

 In 2013-14, MCX paid about Rs 60 crore to FTIL for receiving technological support and services. The new pact will pave the way for MCX to launch new contracts for January to March period of 2015. 

 MCX is confident that it will be allowed to launch all its contracts for the year 2015 once the full divestment by FTIL of its stake in MCX takes place in compliance with sector regulator FMC's order. 

 On September 17, the commodity markets watchdog said the exchange can launch new contracts for first three months of 2015 after if it signs a fresh technology deal with FTIL. 

 FTIL had said that by entering into the new agreement, it has completed all formalities to close its sale of 15 per cent stake in MCX to Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

 FMC had said the exchange will be allowed to roll out contracts for entire 2015 once the full divestment of FTIL in MCX takes place as per the regulatory norms."
New govt should implement policies to revive the banking sector: Amit Shah,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/new-govt-should-implement-policies-to-revive-the-banking-sector-amit-shah/articleshow/35161556.cms,m.economictimes.com,New govt should implement policies to revive the banking sector: Amit Shah,"In a chat with ET Now, Amit Shah, Managing Partner, IIFL Wealth, shares his views on banking stocks. 

 
ET Now: I believe you will agree that private banks are not exactly cheap, sure enough some of them maybe but a lot of them are trading at highs that leaves the PSU banks, will there be clear money running into PSU banks and if so, would it be restricted to the top tier ones or would it find waves across the spectrum?  

 
Amit Shah: Let us talk about two parts of money – one is offshore money coming into India which will come in larger quantum and one is onshore money which is typical retail, HNI money which would get invested in and if you look their psyche, for foreign investor the first and foremost important thing for him is liquidity, that if I invest into this stuff, will I able to exit or not. So by that logic, the first round of allocation will come into more liquid stocks compared to more illiquid stocks which are typically of mid and small cap. 

 
ET Now: The likes of SBI, etc, you think will find favour.  

 
Amit Shah: Correct and then obviously private banks. Now private banks have its own challenges as you would be hearing in media HDFC has an issue where HDFC Bank limits are more or less there so the allocation has gone down, but given a choice obviously companies which are liquid is where the money would flow in. 

 If we see a stable government, in that scenario the first and the foremost thing the government would do or should do is essentially try and improve your banking system because that is a core to any kind of growth because any dollar coming in converts into $10 going out because of the money supply effect and I do not think so it is a difficult thing to do, it is a long term process but if you have a will one can do it and the classic example is if you look at power distribution companies in state of Gujarat, the way non-profitable structure has become so profitable, so the good part about India is we have policy framework in place which just need implementation in the right spirit and if government is determined, the core asset drivers which is a bank, infrastructure if they have that due attention and the balance sheets are helped to cleaned up, the growth numbers there can quite significant."
Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-likely-to-start-flat-on-muhurat-trading-day-may-reclaim-8k/articleshow/44917232.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat-to-higher on Thursday on the first day of Samvat 2071 tracking muted trend across global markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to head higher later in the session to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8000.
 
 US and majority of Asian markets ended on a muted note in trade as a shooting at the Canadian parliament unnerved investors, which triggered profit booking across markets.
 
 Today’s trading also marks the starting of Samvat 2071. It is considered auspicious to start something new on this date and for the same reason, many traders in the stock market too, make token purchase of shares, say analysts.
 
 Samvat 2070 has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The S&P BSE Sensex clocked returns of over 26 per cent in the same period.
 
 Nifty added 68 points to its values and ended at 7995 on Wednesday, whereas the Sensex ended higher by 0.80 per cent or 211 points at 26787.
 
 Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com is of the view that ‘Muhurat Trading’ session would only be a truncated. It might not do much to the index, but on the stock specific side, you could see some action happening, he added.
 
 Nifty cleared the short term resistance of 7970 level on Wednesday on closing basis. Now, the level of 8040 would act as a key resistance to watch out for in the immediate term, say analysts.
 
 ""If 8040 is surpasses we may see some further upside; however, higher up the next resistance is placed at 8090 - 8120 range,"" GEPL Capital said in a report.
 
 ""On the lower side, the immediate support is now placed at 7970 followed by 7930. It is very important that the index takes support in the range of 7970 to 7930 in case of a decline, else we may see resumption of the recent down trend that has come in force after it violated a key support of 7840 in the past week,"" added the report."

However, even this time the Nifty couldn’t cross its resistance mark. In the past couple of sessions, it is consolidating in a narrow range of 6000-6200. This is in sync with what open interest data for Nifty options indicates. Maximum OI is placed at 6000 put and on call side the same is at 6200 call. 

 F&O rollovers for the November series are strong, with both Nifty and the market witnessing above-average rolls percentage against average for the past three F&O expiries. However, this can also be attributed to lower OI base for the current month series. Rollover costs (cost to long rolls) have been shrinking since the past 2-3 trading sessions, which indicates that shorts are more aggressive in rolling their positions. We expect the November F&O series expiry in Nifty between 6050 and 6100. 

 The sentiment indicator, India Volatility Index (VIX) has been rising slowly as we are coming closer to state election dates. We believe if VIX breaches 21.5-22% range then it can test 26-28%. We will assign 70% probability for VIX to break out in coming days before the assembly election results on December 8. 

 In order to play this view we recommend generating a long straddle in Nifty at 6100 strike. The strategy is to buy 6100 strike call and put of December series, with outflow of 270-275 points. This strategy will make money if we see extreme moves on either side along with increase in implied volatility (IVs)."
"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/polls-could-be-a-big-swing-factor-for-indian-market-says-hsbc/articleshow/25992731.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC","NEW DELHI: The general elections could prove to be a ""big swing factor"" for the Indian stock market going ahead, financial services major HSBC said while putting a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014. 

 The Indian market has seen a modest gain of 8 per cent in the current year, but underperformed significantly in US dollar terms as the Indian rupee depreciated sharply in the second half of the year, the company said. 

 According to HSBC, the ""storm has abated"" for the Indian markets as the US Fed has deferred tapering of its quantitative easing stimulus, and as the new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has taken steps to contain the rupee fall. 

 However, ""structural imbalances and the election uncertainty should keep the outlook for 2014 clouded"", HSBC said. 

 ""We expect Indian equities to deliver a below average return of 3 per cent in 2014, while earnings should grow by 8-10 per cent,"" the HSBC report said. 

 ""We are underweight India within the region context with a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014,"" it added. 

 According to the global brokerage major, the upcoming general elections could be a ""big swing factor"" and an ""inflection point"" for the Indian markets. 

 ""In our view, if BJP-led National Democratic Alliance comes to the power, it would be positive for infrastructure -led sectors, while a Congress-led UPA government would be positive for consumption-led sectors,"" it said. 

 The report further said: ""Indian infrastructure spending is likely to rebound whoever wins next year's general election. We see capital goods companies growing profits by 15 per cent in calender year 2014"". 

 ""We prefer to play the market via export-oriented sectors, such as IT and healthcare, which benefit from a weak rupee, or USD proxy plays, such as energy. We are cautious on consumer discretionary, real estate and state-owned banks,"" it added. 

 Moreover, earnings estimates for IT and healthcare companies are likely to be upgraded on the back of sharp currency depreciation. 

 Historically, the Indian market has rallied sharply post any favourable election outcome -- a stable government with a single party holding a commanding position in parliament, the report said."

At 07:45 am, Nifty50 futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 11.50 points higher at 7,945, indicating a flat opening in the domestic market. 	  	Asian markets were trading mixed. Japanese Nikkei was trading 0.42 per cent lower at 19,860. China's Shanghai Composite was down 0.72 per cent at 3,609.  	Among other Asian indices, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.64 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi (up 0.11 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.38 per cent) were trading higher.  	The business and consumer climate data for the euro zone will be released later in the day. Britain will report its preliminary GDP numbers for the September quarter. In India, weekly foreign reserve data will be released. It will also be the first day of the December series futures and options contracts.  	But all eyes will be on the ongoing winter session of Parliament. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Thursday to pay tribute to sitting member Khekiho Zhimomi of Nagaland People's Front, who had passed away earlier in the day.  	""My sense is that the initial phase will be noisy, but the House will get down to business at some point. Once things get to that level, there will definitely be discussions on GST, because it is on top of the government's to-do list. The government will make sure that there is some discussion. One does hope to see the GST bill passed during this session,"" said C Jayaram, Joint Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank. 	Investors will also keep an eye on the dollar-rupee exchange rate and foreign flows trends.  	The rupee closed at an 11-week low of 66.57 on Thursday amid a sharp appreciation in the greenback globally on a likely shift in the policy stance by the US Fed in the December policy review. Hopes that the Fed may hike interest rate in the next policy review have triggered outflows from emerging markets. India has been no exception and has witnessed an outflow of Rs 6,348-odd crore so far in November.    	Market experts say even as the chances of a Fed liftoff in December policy are high, the next rate hike may not happen in 2016, as it will be the year of US presidential elections.  	""Fed feels it needs to be seen to be responsible. It almost never raised interest rates during an election cycle and the election cycle in the US will really start in six weeks. So, we should not expect to have much of a rate hike in 2016,"" said Paul Schulte, Schulte Research.  	Technical charts suggest rangebound trading ahead for Nifty50.  	""For Friday, I expect the market to remain sideways with a positive bias. The 7,800 and 7,920 levels on Nifty50 would be my range,"" said Sandeep Wagle of Power My Wealth.   	Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com said if Nifty50 breaks below 7,820, it would force him to cut long exposure and look aggressively to short some individual names.  	""But yes, from a stock-specific point of view, midcaps as well as some individual names have been buzzing. They are clearly seeing breakouts and some kind of good follow-up buying.

Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/private-placement-to-30-million-investors-wonders-sebis-chief-u-k-sinha/articleshow/21102546.cms,m.economictimes.com,Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,"NEW DELHI: Taking a veiled jibe at Sahara group, market regulator Sebi's Chairman U K Sinha today said a large company collected $4-5 billion from more than 30 million investors and claimed it was a 'private placement'.
 
 Sinha also said that the first regulatory agency that comes to people's mind is Sebi, whenever the issue comes to fore about investor protection in cases of deposit-taking by unathourised schemes.
 
 Without naming Sahara group, Sinha gave example of ""a large company"", which raised more than $4 to 5 billion from more than 30 million investors.
 
 ""And the company claims it was a private placement. Now, how a private placement can reach out to 30 million people is another question?"" Sinha wondered.
 
 As per the Sebi rules and the Companies Act, a private placement is defined as issuance of shares or other securities to a maximum of 49 persons and anything involving 50 or more investors is considered a public offer.
 
 Sebi has been engaged in a long-running case with Sahara group over refund of more than Rs 24,000 crore (about $ five billion) collected by two Sahara companies from more than three crore investors through issue of certain bonds.
 
 Saharas were asked by the Supreme Court last year to deposit the money to Sebi for further refund to investors after verifying their genuineness and the market regulator recently initiated a process for the refund.
 
 However, Saharas have deposited only Rs 5,120 crore with Sebi and have claimed that more than Rs 20,000 crore they have already refunded directly to the bondholders. The case is scheduled for further hearing by the apex court tomorrow.
 
 Speaking at a venture capital conference here, Sebi chief said that the regulator's aim is to protect the interests of investors and focus on corporate governance.
 
 ""When some company, which was not even registered with Sebi, raised money from ordinary investors in the country, for example in West Bengal, people started blaming Sebi.
 
 ""It is not one company and there are multiple companies that raised money from large number of investors. The perception was that money is lost,"" Sinha said, while adding that Sebi always steps in to safeguard investors' interest.
 
 ""So, we are accountable, as the first agency which comes to anybody's mind is, if there is any issue about investor protection, that's Sebi. We have to be careful about that,"" he said."

The company currently derives a bulk of its Rs 21,000-crore turnover from manufacturing and selling jewellery to retailers in the local as well as export markets. 

 The company intends to increase its retail outlets to 125 from 73 stores currently in Karnataka by the end of April 2012 and a total of 550 stores across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala by the end of 2014. For this, it intends to raise Rs 2,500 crore through external commercial borrowing (ECB), Rs 2,000 crore through internal accruals and Rs 2,000 crore through supplier's credit. The proceeds from the ECB will be used to buy gold, said Mehta. 

 The company imports gold dore, or impure gold, from mines overseas and manufactures jewellery at its Bangalore headquarters. ""Since we are fully integrated, we will be able to cut down the supply chain and offer gold jewellery 10-20% cheaper than our rivals,"" claimed Mehta. 

 The company follows an associate model for its retail foray, refurbishing existing stores of jewellers who apply to become its associates and stocking it with its own inventory. The day-to-day cost of the establishment is to be borne by the associates but Rajesh Exports bears the advertising cost apart from providing inventory."

  Deepak Mohoni, Director, trendwatchindia.com in an interview with ET Now talks about refinery stocks.
  
  
  Let us get your view on the refiners because I have read a couple of reports that seem to feel that really quite sceptical about the fact that the government will indeed do something which will really be meaningful in terms of giving a boost to bottom line for all of these companies technically how do they look?
  
  At the moment they are obviously with that bit of a sell off yesterday and the day before they are under pressure but it would appear to be short term pressure because all these companies are very much just a little bit below their highs especially Bharat Petroleum they are life time highs. 
  
  Now, they are not too many stocks in the market which are really there so given that the long term trend in these stocks are stable but one thing to remember about these stocks is they go up during market downtrends and they fall during uptrends and this is exactly what is happening again. Primarily related to the trend in crude oil price, crude oil tends to go up with the markets and these stocks tend to go down with crude oil so that's really what has been happening here.

 Tendulkar and Warne are in the US as captains of an inaugural all-star line-up of 28 cricket legends from across the world for the first ever 'Cricket All Stars' series in the US. 

 Tendulkar and Warne will visit the stock exchange to highlight the inaugural cricket series which will take place in New York, Houston and Los Angeles. They will ring the opening bell at 9:30m New York time that will mark the start of the trading day. 

 The historic tour marks the first time Tendulkar and Warne will play on US soil. 

 The 'Cricket All-Stars' kicks off on November 7 at Citi Field in New York City with a special opening ceremony prior to the match as well as other functions and galas. 

 The second match will be on November 11 in Houston and the final match in the series will be on November 14 in Los Angeles, followed by a special trophy presentation to the winning team. 

 In the past, several Indian dignitaries, including political leaders and businessmen, have rung the opening and closing bell at the stock exchange and at NASDAQ. 

 Given that cricket is not a popular sport in America, it is the first time that cricketers will ring the ceremonial bell at the stock exchange. 

 Through extensive promotions and media appearances, Tendulkar said the idea behind the series is not only to popularise the game in America but to globalise it as there is need to have more countries play the sport competitively in tournaments like the World Cup. 

 ""The reason for picking up a cricket bat again after retirement is to globalise cricket. That is a dream and vision Warne and I have. One day we would like the American (cricket) team also to participate in the World Cup. It would be a great moment. All cricketers have also been endorsing for having cricket in the Olympics. This is the beginning,"" Tendulkar told reporters yesterday."
Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-wants-bourses-to-provide-a-level-playing-field-for-hft-traders/articleshow/33577070.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi wants stock exchanges in India to provide a level playing field for traders who use high frequency trading (HFT) through co-location and those without the facility. 

 The debate over the use of HFT has resurfaced after the recent release of Michael Lewis’ book Flash Boys, which is critical of the system. The discussion within Sebi is that stock exchanges should implement its guidelines issued last year, which states there should be a two-queue system for orders coming from co-location and other mode. 

 Such an architecture will provide orders generated from a space not co-located a fair chance of execution and address concerns related to being crowded-out by orders placed from co-location, a Sebi official said. 

 Co-location is like proximity hosting, where the exchange hosts the subscriber’s server at its data centre near the master trading engine and helps in faster movement of data and execution of trades. Not all traders can use co-location as setting up the infrastructure involves huge costs. Both National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the BSE do not follow any separate queue system currently. 

 The two-queue system would ensure stockbrokers who are not co-located have a fair and equitable access to the stock exchange’s trading systems, said Sebi. The regulator had said distribution ratio of orders from terminals/servers that are not co-located to the orders from co-located servers may be kept at 1:1 and, in future, it may be reviewed based on the feedback from market participants. 

 ""Conceptually, I am not against such a system,"" said Rajesh Baheti, managing director of Mumbai-based Crosseas Capital, one of the largest domestic arbitrageurs using HFT. ""It should be seen if such technology is possible and the results should be measurable."" 

 Lewis argues in his book that the $23-trillion US stock market is rigged in favour of HFT traders, who prey on slower investors by getting early access to non-public information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US is already probing potential criminal activity associated with HFT. 

 On April 4, US attorney general Eric Holder said the justice department is investigating whether HFT violates insider-trading laws. Many other brokers believe the debate over HFT versus non-HFT is a question of market integrity. ""Many private investors do not participate as their orders are executed at a slower speed during events or major news. They believe that markets are rigged against them,"" said a Delhi-based broker. 

 The NSE did not comment on the issue. The BSE said it will continue to implement all Sebi policies in earnest and currently it does not give any priority to HFT traders in terms of information or matching of orders. But then sources close to NSE say the exchange, too, does not allow order matching on priority basis to HFT traders and they get matched as and when they come. 

 As per the latest data on NSE, HFT constitutes 17.15 per cent of the overall trading volumes. HF proponents say Sebi’s suggestion cannot be implemented. ""People will stop co-locating,"" said Hirander Misra, CEO, Global Markets Exchange Group. 

 ""Co-location is mainly for time priority. It gives liquidity to markets with high number of passive orders. If you say orders that come first may not go first, then people will stop using it. Separate order queues will close down co-location."""

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: In the near term though, does it seem like there are any indications of the market getting overheated? Does it seem like the rally could pause - not because of us, but because of the global developments at play right now? 

 
Arindam Ghosh: India has a strong chance of getting de-coupled and the probability of that getting pronounced is going to be incrementally high, because of both domestic and global factors at play. 

 I can point out three domestic factors at this point. One is inflation, which is coming off at a trajectory much sharper than what it was originally estimated to be. Secondly, we are closer than earlier to turn in the monetary cycle. Lastly, growth is definitely showing steady signs of pickup. 

 Add to this the windfall of the global factor in terms of international crude prices, and India looks to be the second best market after US. 

 Hence, irrespective of what happens globally, we really do not anticipate any over-the-cliff kind of a situation. Nevertheless, even in an environment where growth has actually been slowing down, we have the Eurozone which is faltering and we have emerging markets which is battling a slowdown in growth and monetary tightening. 

 On the other hand, you have India, which is actually in a very sweet spot. India will keep on getting more than proportionate share of the allocation when it comes to global and regional allocations. Barring any geopolitical escalation - which is always a possibility - we feel that India, over the long term, definitely looks to be on the up.

Nandkumar Surti: PSUs are closer to the government and they will be impacted, but there are a lot of private sector companies which are also going to be impacted by government policies. 

 However in general, it is expected of this current government that they will improve the efficiencies of the PSU stocks and so there is a lot of positivity around PSU stocks at this point of time. 

 But at the same time, policy decisions are going to equally affect the private sector and I guess they will also benefit from the current government’s policies.

"Simplex Infrastructure: Healthy order book, smart execution to help beat slump blues",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/simplex-infrastructure-healthy-order-book-smart-execution-to-help-beat-slump-blues/articleshow/12155622.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Simplex Infrastructure: Healthy order book, smart execution to help beat slump blues","Kolkata-based Simplex Infrastructure was one of the few small-sized construction firms which did not participate in the recent rally in construction & infrastructure firms. This underperformance could be attributed to the lower margins reflected in the third quarter results of the company. 
  
  At a time when small- sized construction firms have reported a net profit margin of 4-5%, Simplex Infrastructure reported a net profit margin of 1.1% in the quarter ending December 2011. This is due to a foreign exchange loss of 3.3 crore and one-time start-up cost for a few projects. 
  
  Another reason for lower profits is high debt. At the end of September 2011, the company had a debt to equity ratio of 1.64. This is higher in comparison to its peers such as Unity Infra Projects and Pratibha Industries, which have a debt to equity ratio of 1.1 each. 
  
  As a result, a significant amount of the company's operating profits is used for servicing debt. In the December 2011 quarter, its interest expense was 42% to its operating profits. 
  
  In the coming quarters, a strong order book would help the company in allaying these concerns. The company has a healthy order book of 14,441 crore, which is nearly three times its FY11 revenues. 
  
  At a time when most construction companies are facing a dearth of new orders, Simplex Infrastructure has been able to secure nearly 4,162 crore worth of orders in the first nine months of this financial year. One of the main reasons for securing new orders is its execution capability. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Besides, the company's working capital days have also improved in the last few months. Its working capital days improved from 136 days in September 2011 to 120 days in December 2011 quarter, a reflection of the fact that the company has managed its working capital quite effectively in a high interest rate regime. 
  
  Also the fact that the company's order book is well-diversified, helps it weather any slowdown in one particular sector. Of the total order book of 14,441 crore, the company has an exposure of close to 27% to construction activities related to buildings and housing, followed by 26% in power, 11% in roads, and 14% in industrial sectors. On a trailing twelve months basis, the company is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 9.6."

The maximum Open Interest build-up is seen in 5300 Calls and 5200 Puts for January expiry, suggesting a tight trading range broadly for the market.There have not been enough additions in Calls on the downside strike of 5100, which gives some cushion to the fall. Also, decent a build-up in ITM 5100 and 5000 Puts suggests that long positions in index futures have been hedged for the downfall. However, activity in the Open Interest build-up of Calls and Puts on Monday, along with the increase in Volatility and the Discount of the Nifty futures to the spot, suggests that the market may see some more selling in trade on Wednesday.Technically, 5180 acts as a strong support which may be breached in the near term.

Top five things to watch out for in Reliance Industrie 40th AGM,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/top-five-things-to-watch-out-for-in-reliance-industries-40th-agm/articleshow/36749012.cms,m.economictimes.com,Top five things to watch out for in Reliance Industries' 40th AGM,"By Jagannadham Thunuguntla


	The oil & gas major Reliance Industries is scheduled to host its 40th Annual General Meeting on Wednesday. The Street awaits Mukesh Ambani's speech to know more about the future roadmap for KG-D6, cash utilisation on its balance sheet, any update on share gas etc. 


	Here is a list of top five things to watch out in RIL AGM: 


	The future roadmap for KG-D6, in the context of new government and gas pricing: 


	The government is likely to hike natural gas rates from July 1 after a new price formulation is approved by the Cabinet.  And the much benefit is going to be in the hands of Reliance.  At present, of the 165 discoveries under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) regime, only Reliance Industries' KG-D6 field and a small Niko Resources field are under production. However, in the KG-D6 field, production has been declining continuously over the past few years amidst several legal disputes, including one on production shortfall of 154 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd). The management may give a clear roadmap on the much awaited gas pricing issue which has been staging behind for long time.


	Roadmap for any national or international acquisitions including shale gas assets: 


	With the improvement of the global economy and the domestic economy, it is expected that many companies will go for deals. With declining production in the KG-D6, the company will probably focus on increasing stake in Shale gas through green field and brown field projects. Besides, the ongoing deals and acquisition, more acquisitions may be expected to see in the field of telecommunication 4 G service as this is a new concept in India.


	Future of 4G telecom business:
	
	In the days to come it seems that the pace of growth in 4G telecom business can be expected to gear up. As Reliance Jio is preparing a network for high-speed 4G, it has signed a tower-sharing deal with ATC India, in order to roll out its much-awaited high speed data and voice services faster and at a lower cost across India. However, Reliance Communications has signed three back-to-back deals worth Rs 17,200 crore with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio for sharing towers (Rs 12,000 crore), inter-city fibre (Rs 1,200 crore) and intra-city fibre (Rs 4,000 crore). Last month, Reliance Jio Managing Director has said that Reliance Jio will be offering 4G services through a combination of towers they are renting from these partners and those that they are constructing on their own. It apparently plans to construct around 25,000-30,000 towers on its own. It is much expected that management may give clear picture at AGM on this regard.


	Any reference regarding the media business expansion, in the context of ongoing open offer for Network 18:


	Recently RIL had announced that it would invest about Rs4,000 crore through Independent Media Trust, to acquire 78 per cent stake in NW18 and about 9 per cent stake in TV18 Broadcast. Moreover it has also announced that the open offer would begin on July 21 and close on August 4. As the RIL also intends to acquire up to 1.3 crore equity shares of Infomedia Press at Rs3 a share, so, it is expected that on 40th Annual General Meeting, the management may give clear roadmap regarding the media business expansion.
	 

	 

	The usage of cash on balance sheet: 


	As the company has strong balance sheet with the cash reserve of Rs 88190 cr, the company may pronounce the future capital expenditure plan such as reviving the production in KG-D6 basin, any special dividend or buy back.

"Vodafone starts preparatory work for IPO in India, expresses optimism about government",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/vodafone-starts-preparatory-work-for-ipo-in-india-expresses-optimism-about-government/articleshow/49366369.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Vodafone starts preparatory work for IPO in India, expresses optimism about government","NEW DELHI: The Vodafone Group has started ""preparatory work"" for an initial public offering of its Indian unit, although no dates have been set yet, the British telecom company's CEO said, expressing optimism about the emergence of a new India.
 
 Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao, however, argued against the government's proposal to make operators compensate users for call drops, saying such a practice is unheard of in other parts of the world.
 
 Speaking to the media, he said the Indian government needs to decide if it wants to follow a revenue maximisation policy from spectrum auctions or keep airwaves affordable to allow telcos to invest more in the long term, which will improve call quality and facilitate Digital India.
 
 Broadly though, Colao, who has been critical of government policies in the past, said he is witnessing a ""New India"" in which the government is making positive changes towards the ease of doing business.
 
 ""I also hear people say it's (change) not fast enough. I say fine, but it's also a big country,"" Colao said. ""Is it (New India) visible in every aspect of our business? No, it's not, but it's starting to be visible in enough places. If the pace continues, digitisation of the country will happen.""
 
 He pointed to recent decisions on allowing trading and sharing of telecom spectrum as well as the more accommodative stand on taxation as evidence that ""things are changing."" He added that Vodafone is open to sharing and trading of airwaves, which will help improve call services. ""India is clearly one of the five big pillars of Vodafone Group in the world,"" Colao said.
 
 Vodafone is India's second-largest telco with about 187 million subscribers and accounts for 10% of the group's revenue. Its annual capital expenditure of Rs 8,500 crore makes it the biggest foreign direct investor.
 
 Colao is on a four-day trip to India, acountry where Vodafone has faced a slew of tax cases. Almost all the cases have resulted in favourable judgments for the telco, the latest being a Rs 8,500 crore transfer pricing case. Its major Rs 20,000 crore tax dispute on its 2007 deal with Hutchison Whampoa, which facilitated its India entry, is under international arbitration and is progressing in a ""cordial"" way, Colao said. He also appreciated the government's decision in January not to appeal a high court verdict in late 2014, which ruled in favour of the company in a separate transfer pricing case.
 
 Vodafone has revived its IPO plans, which have been considered for several years now. ""I cannot give you a date for an IPO. We are positively inclined to it and we have started some preparatory work,"" Colao said. ""We haven't made a final decision because there are many factors that can influence one way or the other"" such as markets and oil prices.
 
 Vodafone, along with other telcos, have been in the crosshairs of the government on the issue over rising call drops. Colao said Vodafone is working with the government to resolve the issue, but disagreed with the regulator and the telecom department's proposal to force telcos to compensate subscribers for call drops, saying this doesn't happen anywhere in the world.
 
 ""Personally, it's not the right solution. Which operator would like to give bad services to its customer? Which leading operator would like to do that? We are sorting that out,"" Colao asked. He said call drops can't be resolved just by increasing investments because that's not really the cause. Solutions to call drops need to cover aspects such as more spectrum, more telecom towers, access to sites and right of way.
 
 Calling on the government to allocate more airwaves, Colao said India has maximised a lot of revenue out of spectrum auctions by offering low quantities of the natural resource. ""The difficult choice is how large the allocation of spectrum it can make and the second problem is also political choices in order to make spectrum affordable enough, then have a lot of investment following it,"" Colao said. ""Therefore, little bit of thinking of how to make available more spectrum with a longer term view is strategic,"" he said.
 
 He added that affordable bandwidth will allow telcos to invest more in technology, which will improve data speeds and quality of services, which will ultimately boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a Digital India. ""Vodafone is one the great digital partners of India. We are intrinsically a part of Digital India.""
 
 Vodafone believes the annual capex of Rs 8,500 crore is the right amount, which is the biggest by Vodafone in any market. The company plans to launch 4G services in the main data markets and circles and progressively expand."
Waiting to see initiatives from the government for PSU banks: Pramod Gubbi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/waiting-to-see-initiatives-from-the-government-for-psu-banks-pramod-gubbi/articleshow/49007878.cms,m.economictimes.com,Waiting to see initiatives from the government for PSU banks: Pramod Gubbi,"In a chat with ET Now, Pramod Gubbi, VP, Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital, shares views on the banking space. 

 
ET Now: What do you do now, do you buy PSU banks because the scope of improvement is larger over there or do stick it with privates because that is where quality is? 

 
Pramod Gubbi: The scope of improvement is quite large with PSU banks. I do not think anybody would disagree with that. It is just that the effort require, the political will required to resolve some of the issues there are also quite large in terms of scope. So to that extent, I would rather wait to see some real initiatives on the ground from the government. 

 There have been talk, of course, but given the extent of the upside if at all things correct, you would not miss out on too much if you are late to join that party. So I would rather wait on the sidelines to see those initiatives so private sector banks are clearly remain in a better shape to play at this stage.

Indeed, markets had corrected to a point where stocks rose after the actual tapering. Will it be the same if Fed, now led by Bernanke’s successor Janet Yellen, finally decides to hike rates today? Opinions are divided. More than a hike, a lot would depend on the Fed commentary. Markets may stabilise after a brief fall if the language doesn’t suggest a string of future hikes; but the reaction would be stronger if the tone is hawkish — a possibility that most have ruled out. But if Fed keeps rates unchanged, there could be a very brief rally before traders and economists restart the guessing game. On Wednesday, Bloomberg calculation showed that there’s only 30 per cent probability of a rate hike."
"After US Fed status quo, will Raghuram Rajan surprise D-Street with rate cut?",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/after-us-fed-status-quo-will-raghuram-rajan-surprise-d-street-with-rate-cut/articleshow/49012783.cms,m.economictimes.com,"After US Fed status quo, will Raghuram Rajan surprise D-Street with rate cut?","NEW DELHI: With the US Federal Reserve event out of the way, all eyes are fixed on the upcoming Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy meet scheduled for September 29.
 
 The clamour for a rate cut is just getting louder. Industry experts expect at least a 50-bps reduction in repo rate, reports ET Now. But, whether governor Raghuram Rajan obliges with one, only time will tell.
 
 However, there is certainly room for a rate cut, especially after the US Fed decided not to hike rates.
 
 ""The US Federal Open Market Committee's decision (FOMC) to hold its key rates unchanged, for now, gives another reason to Reserve Bank of India governor to lower the central bank's key rates in the September 29 policy review,"" says Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.
 
 Most market participants had feared a rate hike by the US Fed would spark volatility in emerging markets and keep the RBI from cutting rates. However, RBI governor gave no hint as to what he is going to do in the upcoming policy meet due later in the month.
 
 Addressing bankers and industrialists at an event, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that ""we have to keep inflation low not just today but also in the future. Monetary policy will accommodate to the extent there is room"".
 
 The RBI governor further highlighted that the RBI awaits greater transmission of past policy actions.
 
 Industry experts still remain divided, though there is still room for the central bank given the fact that inflation has come down.
 
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in an interview with ET Now, said that we must learn to trust the Reserve Bank (RBI) on rate cut decision. The bank has a history of being a very professional institution which factors in all these concerns.
 
 ""Everybody would like a rate cut but the fact is that the authority to do it is the Reserve Bank and I am sure that they are conscious of the situation,"" he added.
 
 Wholesale Price index data (WPI) released earlier this week showed that deflationary trend continued for the 10th month in a row with inflation plunging to a historic low of (-)4.95 per cent in August. The Consumer price index (CPI) for the month of August came in at 3.66 percent, marginally lower than the July CPI which stood at 3.78 percent.
 
 In an interview with ET Now, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairman, SBI, said she doubted there would be a rate cut by the RBI. However, she sees a case for a 25-bps cut.
 
 Despite the lowering of inflation, optimism levels about recovery in the economy have not rebounded. In fact, the growth data is being looked at cautiously with downside revisions to the growth projected at the beginning of the year.
 
 ""While the price indicators reflect a substantial moderation, it would be interesting to perceive the inflation dynamics once the favorable base effect wanes and full impact of deficit monsoon is visible, that is, after October 2015,"" said Arun Singh, Senior Economist, Dun & Bradstreet India.
 
 ""The factors which currently pose challenges to the growth dynamics are high non-performing and restructured loans, increase in corporate leverage, weak corporate sales, poor export demand and uncertainty over the US Fed rate hike,"" he added.
 
 Singh added that ""weak demand along with low inflation has provided more room to the RBI to further cut the policy rate in the upcoming policy meet"".
 
 We have collated a list of views from various experts as to what they expect from upcoming RBI meet on September 29:
 
 
Daljeet Singh Kohli, head of reseach at India Nivesh: 'rate cut by 25 bps'
 
 No action by US Fed opens up space for the RBI to cut rates at least by 25 bps on or before September 29, as the big risk, run-down on currency, is abated, while inflation data is very much in favour of rate cut. On the hopes of rate cut, we expect rate-sensitive stocks to rally in short term.
 
 
Nitasha Shankar, Vice President - Research, YES Securities: 'Rate cut would help sentiment'
 
 US FED has taken a decision to not raise interest rates, at present. Although there could be a momentary pause in the cautiousness seen in markets in the recent times, however uncertainty will continue till the next Fed meet, which will keep upside capped. As for the Indian markets, the next event that investors would be eyeing will be the RBI meet. A rate cut would help in reviving the positive sentiment.
 
 
India Ratings: 
 
 RBI is likely to cut rates by 25 bps in the upcoming meeting, which is scheduled towards the end of the month, irrespective of what the US Federal Reserve does, India Rating said in a report on Monday.
 
 If the Fed were to delay the normalisation process, which it did, the cushion available could be higher, though RBI may like to retain flexibility for future volatility. Ind-Ra's base case expectation is a 25-bps repo rate cut September 29.
 
 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Market Expert 
 
 Everybody wanted this Fed event to be over. The focus will now shift to RBI for a possible rate cut and 29th September is probably what everybody will be looking forward from here on, because that will be the next date which all of us will start tracking."
AIA share sale set to be World's second largest IPO of the year,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/aia-share-sale-set-to-be-worlds-second-largest-ipo-of-the-year/articleshow/6794398.cms,m.economictimes.com,AIA share sale set to be World's second largest IPO of the year,"HONG KONG: The Asian unit of troubled US insurer AIG looked set on Friday to record the world's second-largest initial public offering this year, in a monster share sale that could still top 20 bn US dollars. AIA said that it had raised 17.8 bn US dollars after pricing its shares at 19.68 Hong Kong dollars (2.53 US dollars) ahead of the insurer's debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange next week.
  
  Frenzied investor demand has already made the IPO Hong Kong's largest ever share sale while the total amount raised could rise if other options are exercised. Agricultural Bank of China in July raised a total of 22.1 bn dollars from its IPO, exceeding the previous world record set by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which raised 21.9 bn dollars in 2006.
  
  However, Agbank's IPO was split with it raising 12 bn dollars in Hong Kong and the rest in Shanghai. Shares in AIA's highly-anticipated offering were priced at almost 16 times forecast earnings this year, Dow Jones Newswires cited an unnamed source as saying.
  
  ""The IPO is a critical turning point for AIA and we are delighted that it has been so positively received by investors around the world,"" Mark Tucker, AIA's chief executive, said in a statement on Friday. On Sunday, AIA said it would initially offer 5.86 bn shares at between 18.38 and 19.68 Hong Kong dollars, adding that it could issue additional shares if it exercised a so-called greenshoe option.
  
  That may bring the total raised to around 20.5 bn dollars and leave AIG with a stake of just 32.9 percent in the firm. AIG, which is on the hook to repay US taxpayers after a government bailout in 2008, won approval last month for the sale.
  
  The US insurer was forced to look at publicly floating AIA in Hong Kong after the collapse in June of a proposed 35.5-bn US dollar sale to the British insurer Prudential.
  
  AIA's reach across 15 Asian countries and its healthy balance sheet explained the strong investor demand, said Francis Lun, general manager of Hong Kong's Fulbright Securities. The firm booked a net profit of 1.75 bn US dollars in 2009.
  
  ""The listing should do well because of the strong investor demand (for AIA shares),"" Lun told AFP, adding that ""AIA is a good company and insurance is always a very strong cash flow business."" But Patricia Cheng, an analyst at Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA, questioned AIA's growth potential despite the firm's well-known brand, noting that it was losing market share in some countries.
  
  ""Investors are in Asia for growth. Today?s AIA unfortunately doesn?t measure up too well,"" she wrote in a report this month. ""(AIA's) influence has been declining across the board. It?s already lost the top positions in China (among foreign operations), Hong Kong and Singapore.""
  
  Major investors in the AIA sale include the Kuwait Investment Authority, the oil-rich Gulf emirate's sovereign wealth fund, and a number of Hong Kong tycoons.
  
  Chinese sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp is also among the buyers, according to reports. AIA traces its roots in Asia back more than 90 years and was the largest foreign life insurer in China in 2009 based on life insurance premiums."

ET Now: Is Europe turning out to be exciting for specially the auto component exporters there?
 
 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay: It has been exciting for quite some time look at the Indian auto component guys most of them had taken the opportunity of the slowdown in European economy and gone and acquired really excellent auto component manufacturing facilities in Europe that has given them a significant toehold vis-à-vis the European auto mobile manufacturers.
 
 Motherson Sumi you were talking about, that is an excellent case in point. There are many other companies which have done the same so I have no hesitation in saying that the globalisation of the Indian auto component industry predominantly happened on the back of the last European recession which actually kicked off in 2007-2008 and the globalisation of Indian auto component industry is thanks to what happened in Europe in 2007-2008. Having said that the opportunities in US also insignificant and some of these guys are looking at acquisition, opportunities in US.
 
 Indian auto component industry is in a very good position, we have a distinct cost advantage, we have technology skill sets which is being developed in India as well so overall it is a good position as far as auto component companies are concerned but you have to be selective, it does not mean that you can just close your eyes and buy any auto component company you have to carefully see. We know what happened recently with Amtek Auto so investors are advised caution, they should examine the company before they jump."

Ashwani Gujral: There was a fear when the tapering was announced; that fear is happening now as well. The Bank Nifty is refusing to participate in this rally. You are not getting that momentum which takes the Nifty up 120 points. That is going to create a problem moving forward. 

 Yes, for the next few days, oil and tech space can take you higher. However, if banks refused to participate, then this rally has troubles even in the next 40 points. 

 That is one reason we have decided not to carry longs on the Nifty which we were from today morning because we need participation of banks."

ET Now: Sticking to midcap IT, is there anything you think that still has a large portion of the move left in it? 

 
Neeraj Deewan: There might be couple of stocks here and there in IT where you can still get those large moves but actually speaking the broader basket, we are not very bullish on IT now because we have seen the large cap stocks doing very well. It came to second tier, it came to the third tier also which has started contributing as far as IT is concerned. 

 Like Mphasis where the non-HP business is also improving and there are talks in the market of HP looking at maybe selling some stake also so there can be some movement which can happen in couple of stocks here and there but as larger basket, the real money that we made in IT has already been made.
 
 You need to see a phase of consolidation, some correction and then maybe you can again take a case of IT though for a longer term IT will still continue doing well with improvment in US, with our rupee staying above 60 so that play is still there but at the current level we are bullish on entering IT."

Fed won't impact Indian bourses that much, say experts","NEW DELHI: While most investors across emerging markets are losing sleep over a possible US Federal Reserve rate hike, Dalal Street seems to be on some ease, say experts.  Their assessment: A knee-jerk reaction, but that would be all. Most analysts do not see a breakdown in the index. Going by the option data too, market participants do not see Nifty50 slipping below 7,500.  There is very strong support at 7,500 strike where the OI concentration stands at 46.55 lakh contracts, according to the data collected on December 3.  For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets  ""Going by incremental data points received over the past one month, the expected downside in the event of a Fed rate hike (60% probability of a rate hike) appears to be diminishing and the recent low of 7,700 on Nifty, in our view, is the near term floor for Indian equity market,"" said Ravi Sundar Muthukrishnan, Senior Vice President, Co-Head, Research, ICICI Securities Ltd.  The domestic equity market looks more prepared, and the nervousness that was back in the July-August period seems to be abating. India continued to be among underperforming equity markets for the month of November (-1.6% as against an average of flat returns across global equity markets) due to sustained FII selling (- USD 1 bn).  ""Historically, sustained selling by FII's has resulted in a sharp fall in Indian equities, which seems to have abated in the recent past. One of the key supports for the Indian markets has been DIIs and that too MFs despite of high volatility,"" added Muthukrishnan.    One possible reason highlighted by experts was that fact that US Federal Reserve planned to hike rates back in the July-August period. The timelines were then pushed to December, which gave investors enough time to investors to structure their portfolio.  A possible rate hike will make emerging markets (EMs), including India, less attractive, but will make US treasuries more attractive. If US Fed hike rate happens, then such a move will raise the cost to borrowing in dollar terms. The dollar will gain strength which will weigh on emerging market currencies, say experts.  ""The US Fed rate hike has been well anticipated. I know that the timing was uncertain. We began 2015 with a consensus somewhere around mid-year 2015 for a rate hike, that moved towards the autumn and the view has now settled to a December date,"" said Atsi Sheth, Moody's Investors Service.  ""While the timing has moved, the rate in near future is something that the markets have already anticipated quite well, and we anticipate that there will be maybe a little bit more turbulence when an announcement is made, but we should not see the kind of severe drops in currencies, because markets will have absorbed most of the impact of the rate hike,"" she added.  With US Fed indicating a trajectory of higher interest rates, there could be capital outflows from the EM economies as the rate differential reduces, say experts. USD/INR is expected to see some depreciation pressure as the Fed raises interest rates-in line with other Asian currencies.  ""India was more vulnerable to Fed rate hike back in 2013, because its current account deficit was much higher. It had larger external financing needs. As that deficit has narrowed, the market, in fact, this year the Indian rupee has performed relatively well compared to some of its Asian peers,"" said Sheth.  Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted at a possible US rate hike later this month when the central bank meets for its 2-day meet starting December 15. But, clarity is something which market participants across the globe are looking at.  ""We think in the near term this sort of subdued performance is expected to continue, because we have a major event happening around the 15th and 16th of this month. Till such time as there is more clarity on which direction the interest rates are headed in United States, investors are unlikely to tale large positions on any market and India would not be an exception to it,"" said Nitasha Shankar, HoR, Yes Securities.  Significant decline in the markets due to large FII selling has been used as a strong buying opportunity by DII's and other retail investors.  ""If you are looking at a two- to three-year perspective, India is fundamentally in a very good position. Ideally, investors should use these kind of dips to invest for a long term but for near term, probably this performance would continue so one could just look at it from that perspective,"" she added.  One of the reasons for the outperformance could be the fact that India is relatively better placed amongst emerging markets (EMs). The growth seems to be coming back, and earnings are likely to bounce back from next few quarter.  Most of the macros such as current account deficit, and fiscal deficit are not at alarming levels unlike in 2013. So, we have some cushion to absorb external shocks, say experts.  ""India's macro fundamentals remain a huge positive given a fall in the commodity prices including oil prices. Lower crude oil and commodity prices are leading to significant improvement in India's micro economic position in terms of fiscal deficit and current account deficit,"" said Sanjay Dongre, EVP & Fund manager, UTI MF.  ""Earnings growth is expected to be over 15% in FY17 and in FY18 as higher expenditure by Govt coupled with lower interest rates may lead to higher GDP growth in the economy. As the India's fundamental standout among emerging markets, foreign inflows are likely to resume post the rate hike by Fed,"" he added."
Canada-based Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide sold to a group of strategic financial investors,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/canada-based-aditya-birla-minacs-worldwide-sold-to-a-group-of-strategic-financial-investors/articleshow/29616989.cms,m.economictimes.com,Canada-based Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide sold to a group of strategic financial investors,"MUMBAI: Aditya Birla group has sold its Canada-based business and technology outsourcing firm Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide to a group of strategic financial investors, led by Capital Square Partners, owned by entrepreneur-turned-investors Sanjay Chakrabarty and Aparup Sengupta, and CX Partners.
 
 The deal was consummated at a valuation of Rs 1,500-1,600 crore. At the time of going to press, the board of Aditya Birla Nuvo, the parent company for Minacs, had cleared the proposal for stake sale.
 
 While Sanjay Chakrabarty was the founder and director of MobiApps, private equity fund CX Partners is managed by former head of Citi group’s private equity business Ajay Relan.
 
 The $40-billion telecom-to-retail group has decided to exit from the IT and ITeS business as Minacs is yet to become a dominant player in its core businesses.
 
 Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had earlier told ET that the group companies should be among the top three players in their respective fields.
 
 Minacs, which employs 21,000 people across 35 locations in the world, is the country’s sixth-largest BPO firm, according to rankings compiled by Nasscom.
 
 
  
 “One of the most powerful sources of value creation at the ABG group is its capital allocation review process. The decision to pull capital out of BPO is the application of the same strategic lens. The capital will get reallocated to businesses with superior strategic position,” said Rajeev Gupta, M&A rainmaker and founder of advisory firm Arpwood Capital.
 
 The business conglomerate entered the IT industry in 2001 by acquiring Bangalore-based PSI Data Systems, cofounded by Rediff promoter Ajit Balakrishnan. The group then took over BPO firm Transworks owned by IITians Rizwan Koita and Jagdish Moorjani in 2007.
 
 This was followed by the acquisition of Canadian firm Minacs. Minacs and Transworks later merged its operations to create Aditya Birla Minacs."

  The trade unions had boycotted the divestment of the government's stake in Coal India Limited and had asked employees to abstain from participating in the issue.
  
  The government had reserved 10 per cent of the total shares on sale for CIL employees and had offered a discount of 5 per cent to workers on the issue price of Rs 245 per share.
  
  ""If workers are ready, we can make allotment of up to 2 per cent shares to them on a preferential basis at the same price,"" Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal told PTI in an interview.
  
  The majority of the 3.98 lakh strong workforce did not bid for shares of the world's largest coal producer when the government offloaded a 10 per cent stake in CIL in October, 2010, garnering a whopping Rs 15,200 crore.
  
  Union leaders had called a strike on the first day of the share offer in October, 2010, and asked workers to abstain from bidding for it.
  
  Out of the 63.16 crore shares on offer, 10 per cent of which were reserved for its employees, only 10 per cent of the reserved shares were bid for by employees as the trade unions were protesting the share sale and had advised workers to stay away from the public offer.
  
  The small investors got good listing gains as they were allotted shares at Rs 232.75 a share after a discount of 5 per cent to the final issue price of Rs 245. However, the majority of the employees failed to cash in on the opportunity due to opposition from unions.
  
  ""Had the employees bought shares then, they could have been reaping rich dividends now,"" Jaiswal said regretting the opposition by the unions. ""But if they agree, we can still consider it,"" he added.
  
  A handful of employees who have the shares today have seen the price appreciate by about Rs 70 apiece from what they bought them for, as CIL's shares are hovering at around Rs 300 per share at present.
  
  CIL's IPO was a grand success and Jaiswal earlier had termed Coal India as ""Gold India.""
  
  The blockbuster issue was kicked-off after the Durga Puja festival and the world's biggest coal producer made its debut on the stock exchanges on November 4 -- a day before Diwali -- joining the club of the top-five most valued companies by market cap.
  
  The IPO got an overwhelming response from all investors and was oversubscribed 15.17 times, translating into total demand of Rs 2.3 lakh crore for the 63.16 crore shares on offer."

Mitesh Thacker: Reversals do happen and Tuesday appeared to be one of the days when the immediate or the short-term trend on the intraday charts got disturbed, possibly reversed.
 
 Concerns over Bank Nifty actually suggest that there could be more downside on Nifty. The banking index could head slightly lower. I am slightly bearish and expect 18,500 on the index would be the minimum target from here on. I am also prepared to look at 18,250 on the index on the downside. This suggests that Nifty might have slightly deeper correction than what we initially estimated it to be.
 
 The 50-pack index is close to its support level of 8,530. That said, in case we start breaking below that level, 8,450-8,420 on the downside could be easily revisited. That means there could be another 100-point cut. Most importantly, you might not get an uptrend immediately after that. We might have some kind of choppiness, more of a consolidative movement, before the index starts going up.
 
 So, I would be slightly bearish; we have taken some short positions on the banking side, on the banking index and individual banking names. Possibly, IT is the only hiding space. It is the only space where you would be comfortable holding aggressive long positions."

 Automated or algorithmic trading is a system for trading through a programmed software that can make around 800 transactions per second. The software-helped trading was allowed by Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 2005. 

 Besides SEBI and Finance Ministry, Justice Rajiv Shakdher has also issued notices to Reserve Bank of India, BSE and NSE on the plea alleging algorithmic trading put small investors at a disadvantage in comparison to big brokers and FIIs. 

 The court, which was hearing the plea of a group of retail investors 'Intermediaries and Investor Welfare Association', has fixed the matter for hearing on January 29. 

 The Association, in its plea, alleged algorithm trading system ""discriminates between rich and influential brokers and common investors/ retail investors and creates inequality and finally casts a deceptive data to common investors and retail investors while trading in shares and securities on online trading platforms of BSE and NSE"". 

 It also alleged that SEBI and Finance Ministry have been ""silent spectators"" on the issue and ""not bothering to check the fallout"" of algorithmic trading. 

 It said algorithmic trading ""creates unfair advantage"" to members who use the software against ordinary investors. 

 The algorithmic trading, which is faster, gives an edge to big investors in selling and purchasing shares and hence, this is discriminatory, the plea said."

 The stocks market came under selling pressure this week due to profit booking at higher levels. A set of good corporate quarterly numbers was discounted quickly. Stocks of companies that reported numbers in line or above estimates maintained status quo in prices, but companies whose Q2 numbers were below expectations got hammered. 

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have slowed down their buying spree and have gone into a wait and watch mode, awaiting the Bihar poll results. The market will remain subdued till the first week of November. 

 
Events of the week:  

 The US Federal Reserve in its bimonthly meeting for the first time gave a reasonable indication that US interest rates are likely to increase before the yearend, causing a flurry in global financial markets. 

 Domestic stock exchanges this week revised the contract value to minimum Rs 5 lakh in the derivatives segment, potentially impacting the liquidity in market. 

 The IPO of IndiGo although got over-subscribed six times, the retail investors quota went partially unsubscribed, indicating that market sentiments are bearish for the short term. At the same time, it also clearly showed that a huge bull market wrapped by frenzied activities of retail investors is yet to come. 

 
Technical outlook:  

 The Nifty50 has moved into profit-taking mode after rising 10 per cent since last month. The 8,100-8,000 levels are crucial for Nifty50 for medium-term strength. However, a close below 8,000 would indicate a reversal of the medium-term uptrend, which may potentially correct the entire rally since the beginning of September. 

 If the trend weakens and key levels are breached than Nifty50 can go down all the way to 7,800 level. The probability of continued weakness is high as the market is awaiting the important outcome of Bihar elections. 

 
Expectations for the coming week: 

 The mood of the market should remain mildly bearish with bouts of selling in stocks of companies that have reported earnings below expectations. Foreign investors have started hedging their long positions and have shifted to a wait-and-watch mode. 

 Corporate results have been good so far with fewer negative surprises, although majority of them have managed to keep the past momentum but the acceleration was clearly missing. The market can go into sideways consolidation with a negative bias for want of fresh triggers. 

 The market will most likely wait for Bihar election results before any substantial move. Nifty50 ended the week down by 2.70 per cent to close at 8,065.80.

This even as total rainfall so far this season is 10% above normal.“The steady progress of monsoon has already resulted in many commodities coming off their highs but we are still keeping a watch on the market,” Ramesh Abhishek, chairman, FMC told ET. 

 Chana, castorseed, coriander and jeera have witnessed significant volatility in recent times, especially after fears of a deficient monsoon cropped up. To tackle ‘abnormal’ volatility, exchanges at FMC’s instance have advanced the delivery period in the likes of castor, chana and coriander and even introduced additional margins on longs and shorts. As a result of these regulatory actions, entities attempting to squeeze sellers by cornering stocks in the physical markets and simultaneously mounting bullish bets in the futures market were forced out of the market. This reduced excessive volatility in counters like castor which saw historic delivery worth Rs 948 crore in the January contract on NCDEX. 

 So far 29,369 tonnes of castor have been delivered in the June contract that expires on June 19, 8500 tonnes in chana and 100 tonnes in coriander. The FMC this month advanced the delivery period in chana and coriander from June 11 to June 4 which resulted in those trying to manipulate the counters moving out of the market at the risk of being forced to take delivery a broker said. Nine of the ten top clients were net long castor on Thursday, the same being the case in chana, NCDEX data shows."

Government to review 'Call & Put Option' rules that hit DoCoMo exit plan,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/government-to-review-call-put-option-rules-that-hit-docomo-exit-plan/articleshow/48151524.cms,m.economictimes.com,Government to review 'Call & Put Option' rules that hit DoCoMo exit plan,"NEW DELHI: The government is set to review rules that led to the rejection of NTT DoCoMo’s proposal to sell shares to Tata Sons at a pre-agreed price to exit their joint venture five months ago. The move is aimed at attracting bigger private equity and venture capital investment in the booming ecommerce sector and other emerging areas.
 
 The finance ministry is looking at allowing greater pricing flexibility for securities with an exit valuation clause at a rate set beforehand, technically known as a ‘call and put option.’ “There are issues with pricing of quasi-equity instruments... We are examining the norms,” a senior government official aware of the development told ET, confirming that the regulations were being reviewed.
 
 The ‘call and put option’ rules have undergone frequent changes, creating policy confusion and delays that undermine business sentiment, according to experts.
 
 It was this year’s finance Act that shifted control on equity capital flows to the finance ministry from the Reserve Bank of India, giving the government power to review these rules. However, the government has to administer these in consultation with the central bank.
 
 
 
TATA-DOCOMO CASE
 
 In January, the RBI had suggested allowing the transfer of shares by a nonresident investor at a price higher than their fair value in view of the Indian partner's contractual commitments in the Tata-DoCoMo case. The policy allowed for a fair valuation different from the exit valuation agreed between the two investors in the telecom venture. The RBI’s view was that the contractual agreement should be honoured and pitched for a change in policy. The finance ministry, wary of changing the existing policy in one instance, asked RBI to take a view on the case in line with the central bank's own guidelines. It subsequently took over jurisdiction of the policy in the February budget.
 
 
CASE FOR MORE FELXIBILITY
 
 The Narendra Modi-led government, which has launched the Make in India initiative among others to boost economic activity, is keen to attract foreign capital to spur the country's manufacturing sector.
 
 Last week, the union cabinet cleared a policy to allow fungibility of all forms of foreign capital within sectoral caps as part of its drive to make the country a more attractive destination for overseas investors. The review of the ‘call and put option’ pricing rules are part of the government's push to iron out difficulties they posed for investment of risk capital in emerging areas. The central bank had also written to the finance ministry on the issue of pricing norms governing exits and the need to re-examine the existing policy. Industry has sought changes as well. “The pricing norms should facilitate the execution of the real commercial understanding between the parties, especially concerning the put/call option pricing for the deal, irrespective of the fair market valuation of the shares,” said Punit Shah, partner, Dhruva Advisors.
 
 
TROUBLED PAST
 
 A ‘call’ option allows the holder to buy shares in an entity at an agreed price, while a ‘put’ option allows an investor to sell. Though popular, these instruments were not looked upon with too much favour by the RBI as it was worried that they would lead to foreign debt coming in disguised as equity. Put options, which give special rights to foreign investors to sell back equity if certain conditions such as timely listing are not fulfilled by Indian company, were seen largely as facilitating debt flows that would go out after a certain period.
 
 In 2011, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), taking its cue from the RBI, had even banned these instruments but soon retracted the policy measure over fears it could slow down foreign investment. In 2013 the RBI, finance ministry, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and DIPP reached an understanding on these instruments and agreed to allow them with a one-year lock-in period after adhering to pricing norms.
 
 In its rules, the RBI said exits could not be at a price higher than that arrived at on the basis of return on equity, a change from the earlier norm based on the discounted cash flow method it had specified. After representations against this condition, in July 2014, the RBI said any internationally recognised pricing methodology would be accepted.
 
 The RBI's views in the case of Tata NTT DoCoMo were thus seen as a complete reversal of its earlier stance against such instruments.
 
 
Let them plan their exit 

 The rules for pricing of ‘call and put option’ have rarely been objective, informed more often than not by the fear of debt entering in the guise of equity. Such fears do not sit well with India’s attempts to bring private equity and venture capital to fund avalanche of ideas by the internet generation. And India’s external account is no longer vulnerable to a few billion dollars flowing out. Investors putting up risk money to funds innovation need to be commensurately rewarded. Simpler rules are called for to govern how companies provide exit to foreign investors. Within a broad framework this needs to be left to the companies."

The firm has also announced elevation of two of its directors, Ritesh Banglani and Rahul Chowdhri, as partners at the venture fund. 

 Singh had set up Helion in 2006 along with Ashish Gupta, Sanjeev Aggarwal and Rahul Chandra. While Gupta and Aggarwal are at the level of senior MD, Chandra is an MD at the venture capital firm which manages $600 million across funds. Singh will stay with Helion till March 2016 and effect a smooth transition. 

 ""This comes at a time when the fund has considerably increased the focus on technology investing,"" said the statement from Helion. 

 Former co-head of venture capital at Carlyle in India, Singh primarily focused on consumer sector investments at Helion Venture. He serves on boards of Fashionara, HummingBird, YLG Salons, Qwikcilver, Mast Kalandar, Yepme, Attano and LifeCell. 

 In his previous stints before venture capital, Singh worked as marketing head for Intel South Asia before which he was at Hindustan Unilever for a decade in functions like sales, marketing and product innovation. 

 Singh’s move coincides with Helion promoting two of its relatively younger team members. Chowdhri, former Microsoft executive, has been associated with Helion since inception and worked on investments like salon chain YLG and online test prep startup Toppr. Bangalani joined in 2010 from IDG Ventures and has worked on investments like cab aggregator TaxiForSure and realty classifieds portal Housing. 

 Helion Ventures, which has offices in Delhi and Bangalore, has been one of the most active investors in Indian startups over the last 7-8 years. Some of the firms well known investments include online travel portal MakeMyTrip and bus ticketing website RedBus, both of which it has exited."
Here why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/heres-why-devi-shetty-of-narayana-health-is-looking-to-hit-dalal-street/articleshow/48751746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Here's why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,"One afternoon last month, Dr Devi Shetty, who usually speaks to journalists as a philosopher would to an acolyte, sat in his gleaming office in the Narayana Health (NH) campus looking rather uneasy.

“According to Sebi rules, my lawyers say I’m not supposed to talk about future plans or financials,” he said, the words not sitting as comfortably on his tongue as cryoprecipitate just had. He sat back self-consciously. “But I can talk about healthcare in general, or maybe not... I don’t know, let’s see.”

It’s the most inarticulate anyone might have seen the good doctor. The reason for this unusual reticence is that NH is planning to launch a public issue soon. The multispecialty hospital chain, valued at an estimated Rs 5,000 crore and currently financed by investors CDC and JP Morgan, hopes to raise Rs 1,200-1,500 crore from the market.

So, although Shetty had agreed to a conversation at this pivotal moment, it called for a certain guardedness and occasional disclaimers. The IPO his biggest expansion plan yet was like a flashing billboard we were desperately trying not to look at.

Dr Shetty was in loose blue scrubs, a surgical mask dangling at his neck. His hands were pink with just-washed germlessness and he exuded the distracted calm of surgeons. He had a bypass in a couple of hours. “Do you mind if I ate lunch while we talked?” Out came a steel lunch carrier from home: rotis, vegetables, curd and mangoes but he kept going for the Mangalorean fish fry.

As he ate, he evoked the elusive dream of shedding all administrative responsibilities to simply be a cardiac surgeon. “I had to set up a whole hospital chain to be able to come back to doing the work I love, the way I want to do it,” he said laughing and chewing.

“That’s the magic and pain of entrepreneurship.” But an IPO and public listing will add several responsibilities that will inevitably fight for attention with cardiac surgery, his first love. It will also test Shetty’s ability to balance his social agenda — affordable surgeries for the poor — with investors’ expectations of reasonable returns.

Why an IPO NH treats more than 2 lakh in-patients and around 15 lakh out-patients annually, most of them from rural and underprivileged backgrounds. This was Shetty’s vision when he established NH, then Narayana Hrudayalaya, in the year 2000 to create a space for accessible, affordable healthcare.

Still, many of his anecdotes betrayed a restiveness. Yes, NH was the world’s largest low-cost hospital. “But did you know that India needs 20 lakh heart surgeries a year, but is capable of doing only around 1.2 lakh?”

“Mothers ask how much a surgery for their child will cost. I quote an amount. If they don’t have that much, they won’t get the operation. That’s what I do – that’s what all Indian doctors do – every day: put a price on a child’s life,” he said. The IPO will help NH build more hospitals to do more such surgeries cheaper.

Shetty’s son and senior vice-president Viren Shetty puts it pithily: “The IPO will enable us to be more us.” But the IPO will also bring the added responsibility of earning reasonable financial returns for shareholders.

Being a publicly listed company will open the low-cost hospital to the cycle of quarterly results and shareholder expectations and financial pressures that might compete with Shetty’s social goals.

Shetty himself was uncomfortable with it in the past. In a speech in June 2012, he had explained why his family candidly.


	 


“We are in business because we want to help the underprivileged and the cost of healthcare to come down. For that, I need the freedom.” At that time, his eccentric enterprise was funded by private investors JP Morgan and AIG, from whom they raised `200 crore each. In January 2015, UK-based CDC invested Rs 300 crore.

Then, Shetty kept his freedom and his private investors through standardisation and scale — investor speak for rationalising expenses and treating large numbers of poor people with the quality they deserve.

Shetty’s famously soft voice searched for a new phrase for his frequently quoted goal of ‘Walmartising’ healthcare, which he is now weary of. “Size for social impact, size for sustainability,” he finally said.

NH pursues economies of scale with a vengeance: it performs among the world’s largest number of heart surgeries, aggressively reduces costs through centralised purchases of supplies and innovates processes from billing to intensive care. NH does this in its 31 hospitals in 19 cities in India, and one in the Cayman Islands off the coast of the USA.

Walking through any NH campus is like seeing the wide gap between a government and private multi-specialty hospital close. Two floors below Shetty’s quiet office in the Bengaluru campus, the emergency ward teems with patients, nurses holding IVs, and doctors running soundlessly through hallways. A reed thin woman from Manipur sits under a tree near the cancer centre, breastfeeding her daughter — her husband was having surgery later that day.

It would cost her Rs 80,000, half of how much other private Indian hospitals charged. Another elderly woman from a village in Belgaum said her son was recovering from a bypass, paid in full by the microhealth-insurance scheme NH had pioneered for poor cooperative farmers in 2003 with the Karnataka government.

The Bengaluru hospital performs 49 surgeries a day, using specialists, high volume and technology to drastically reduce the time and cost of treatments. “How do we stay low-cost?” asked Shetty. “Because we’re big. Because we’re big, we can roll out the innovation across the hospitals. We can dictate terms in our purchases, we can maximise the use of expensive clinical equipment.”

While most hospitals use their infrastructure for around 8 hours, NH claims to use it for 12-14 hours a day. The average number of CT scans per machine in India is a maximum seven while in NH, Shetty said it is about 30. Since NH implants the largest number of heart valves in the world, valve manufacturing companies can sell their products at a lower cost to the hospital.

NH’s revenue in the latest available data for 2013-14 was Rs 1,072.68 crore, roughly a fifth of the biggest healthcare player Apollo’s and fourth of Fortis’. In the five years leading up to March 2014, however, NH’s income grew at a rate of 35%, ahead of Apollo and Fortis that grew at 18.7% and 29% respectively in the same period.

Volumes, cost cuts and tiered pricing have enabled NH to manage a net profit growth rate of 3.5% in the last five years kept a majority stake in the company. “We are eccentric people,” he had said (see Narayana Health vs...). “We make only a small margin compared to other big hospitals, but we are staying afloat treating a majority of poor patients for half the price,” said Shetty.

It’s All for the Mission A doctor from Manipal Hospital called NH “a temple for Devi Shetty”. Dozens of patients waited outside Shetty’s Bengaluru office, and an elderly man treated by NH’s senior oncologist used the word “darshan” when he said he wanted to catch a glimpse of Shetty before returning to his village. In Shetty’s defence, Vasuki, who has worked with Shetty for more than a decade, puts it down to “gratitude”.


	 


A few of Shetty’s detractors imply that it is the personal charm, not the hospital’s model that has opened doors for NH and smoothened expansion. In a blog post on June 9, 2012, Mumbai-based Dr Aniruddha Malpani, a popular infertility specialist, disparaged Shetty as “healthcare’s blue-eyed boy… unlikely to ever be critically analysed”. He also writes that Shetty has “political clout”.

Indeed, the doctor is friendly with Karnataka’s senior Congress leaders, the most well-known relationship being that with SM Krishna, who was chief minister when NH opened its first hospital off Bengaluru and set up the micro-health insurance scheme with the Karnataka government.

NH has also provided free primary health services since 2005 in 15 blocks of Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli and Amethi, constituencies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. In 2012 in Ahmedabad, the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi provided land for and inaugurated NH’s multispecialty hospital.

Now, Shetty continues to meet prime minister Modi as the secretary of the Association of Health Providers India. The connections give NH access to cheap land, trimming a large component of building a hospital.

It has helped NH grow not only in Karnataka and Gujarat, but also Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Assam.

Public-private partnerships like microhealth insurance and low-cost care centres also help displace the cost by getting the state, instead of the patient or NH, to foot part of the bill. While the harshest critics imply favouritism, no one suggests foul play.

Shetty’s healthcare visionary persona also seems to attract young, passionate healthcare professionals to the hospital. Like Dr Arvind Ranganathan in the first floor cardiac ICU, who is setting up iKare, a point-of-care app created by NH and IT Services firm Cognizant to centrally record and monitor patient vitals.

Or the Bengali-speaking young office manager Rajeev Yadav, who helped When Dr Ranganathan spoke of coming to NH after spending years in the US with healthcare startups, and Yadav of growing up poor in Kolkata wondering if he could ever afford to do social work, they glowed with the same sense of purpose.

Both seemed to believe Shetty had picked them personally for the job. Undeniably, Shetty’s surgical-outfit wearing, kindly, always accessible image has swayed private investors, suppliers, governments and healthcare professionals to back his unconventional ideas.

The public shareholder is the new frontier. The global praise for NH’s business model, and its ever-expanding existence has encouraged many small healthcare ventures across the country to scale up.

Low-cost care, smarter diagnosis, and India-proof medical technology are now funded by a growing cluster of impact investors – those who invest in companies with social goals. “In the last 10 years, the availability for funding in healthcare has exploded, and many are not charitybased, but for-profit models,” said Ashwin Naik, founder of Vaatsalya Healthcare, which sets up low-cost hospitals in small towns.

A PwC report said the average investment size by private equity funds in healthcare had increased from US$5-15 million to US$ 20-30 million, most of it in diagnostic centres and hospital chains. It is significant why NH chose an IPO at this juncture.

“The immediate reasons are that Narayana’s current investors are looking for an exit,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Dr Shetty’s friend, co-promoter, neighbour and Biocon founder, who runs the cancer centre in NH. “Some of the capital raised will be used to pay off debts to them. The rest will help Devi’s model reach even more people.”

Viren described it as a moment to tackle “the new problem of scale”. “We have solved the problem of cost. Now it’s about more land, more buildings, more technology, more doctors, more patients.” Today, NH has 6655 beds in all, but Shetty has always said his dream was 30,000 beds by 2020.

“To achieve that kind of size, you can’t but go to the market,” Shaw said. Size can be the reason for the IPO, but could the IPO shake the social-commercial balance of NH? Public investors might demand a greater returns, challenging NH’s working equation of social good and financial returns.

In recent years, for instance, the company has not paid any dividends, even if, with a majority stake, Shetty’s family would have stood to gain the most. It is a testament to the model’s intention of funnelling all gains into the social goal, but such a decision might not be as easy when public shareholders are involved.

Roopa Kudva, managing director of impact investor Omidyar Network, disagrees. Financial pressures are “constructive” for social businesses, said Kudva, also the former MD and CEO of ratings agency Crisil. “From businesses with social goals, investors would expect discipline, not unreasonable profit.”

Amit Bhatia, CEO of Impact Investors Council believes the NH IPO will be “a path-breaking one”, providing evidence that “businesses can do good and still be responsible in terms of economics.”

Viren Shetty argues that the vision was never constrained by having forprofit investors in the past, and the challenges with going public could be no less than before. “NH has never been flush with profits. Investors, private or public, know what we stand for when they put their money in it,” he says.

The senior Shetty is less direct. A few times in the interview, he asked this one question, in different ways: “Who says a for-profit hospital cannot achieve social impact, and do it for 20, 30, 40 years?”

Now he has to convince investors.

Efforts mounted by the company over the past few quarters now appear to be bearing fruit for the FMCG company. More than 50% of its product portfolio has either been relaunched or rebranded. 
  
  It has increased its coverage to 5,000 more stores — most of them in rural areas. A volume growth of 13.5%, in spite of past year’s high base in the face of an intense competition, looks impressive. Operating profit, which rose 9%, was largely impacted due to high input cost. 
  
  Selective product price increases and a calibrated adspend could not help the company boost operating profit margins. While the MNC consumer giant has successfully managed to defend its leadership across categories, the moot point is how much of this is sustainable in a high inflation scenario and growing competition from national and regional players as well as other multinational companies. In 2010, the company was seeking to push up volumes through price cuts and discounts on products. 
  
  This year, it has changed the tack and is taking price increases on products back to year-ago levels. The company has indicated that the mix of price and volume growth is likely to change since increase in prices may put pressure on volume growth. Investments in brands given competition and higher input cost inflation are two cost heads for FMCG firms. 
  
  For HUL, addressing this ought not be tough, considering its deep pockets. It will need to adjust adspends and brand equity to pass on input costs to consumers. However, soaps and detergents , the largest revenue-earner segment for HUL, continues to be a sore point for the company. This category is marked by competition, rising raw material prices and a slowdown in consumer demand. HUL appears to have adopted a wait and watch approach to gauge consumer behaviour in this category. 
  
  One of the few FMCG stocks to have declined since the start of 2011, HUL’s stock has now fallen 9%. With its performance back on track, the company’s stock, which is now trading at a price to earnings multiple of 27 and a dividend yield of 2.3%, looks attractive among FMCG stocks. 
  
  The markets appear to have recognised that with the stock surging 3.5% on Monday after the results. However, given the current macro economic scenario, HUL will have to up its game to sustain this performance, if it has to emerge as a favourite among investors again."

  What is your view on Reliance Industries, what do the chart suggests? 
   
  The downside in the Reliance looks little bit kept but yes the immediate resistance for Reliance is somewhere at 1018 and 1048 levels. Once that level is crossed, then again we would see Reliance testing the levels of 1100. So one has to wait for 1048 to be crossed then only momentum could be seen in this counter."
"IRFC likely to launch tax-free bonds worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/irfc-likely-to-launch-tax-free-bonds-worth-rs-4532-crore-on-december-8/articleshow/50035721.cms,m.economictimes.com,"IRFC likely to launch tax-free bonds worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8","MUMBAI: Investors, disappointed with the moderate allotments in recent tax-free bonds by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), could gear up for the largest such issue in the financial year. Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) is said to be launching its tax-free bond issue worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8. 

 It is about 6.5 times the size of earlier issues of tax free bonds from NTPC, PFC and REC, which were of Rs700 crore each. Retail investors got meagre allotment in the earlier issuances due to the smaller size though 40% of the issue size was reserved for them .Typically those who applied for Rs1 lakh, got allotment worth Rs 12,000-15,000 due to heavy subscription. 

 Being a big issue, the chances of allotment in IRFC are higher. Distributors are urging investors to apply for a slightly higher amount to get their quota. “The issue size from IRFC is six times more than that of the earlier issues. 

 Interest rates on offer are also marginally higher,” says Jyotheesh Kumar, Senior Vice-President, HDFC Securities. These tax-free bonds will have three tenures — 10 years, 15 years and 20 years. The 10-year bonds for retail investors will carry 7.32%, 15-year bonds will offer 7.53%, while the 20-year bonds will offer 7.5%. 

 “If investors, want an allotment of Rs 5 lakh, they would do well to apply for about Rs8 lakh as we expect a 50-60% oversubscription in this issue as well,” says Rupesh Bhansali, Head (Distribution), GEPL Capital. High networth individuals, who typically make applications for over Rs10 lakh, could also look at splitting applications. 

 Investors, who want allotment of up to Rs40 lakh, could consider splitting applications across family members of Rs10 lakh each for their applications to be considered in the retail category. This also helps in getting a higher interest as the retail category carries a 0.25% higher interest as compared to the HNI category."

 ET Now: Is it a good time now to revisit some of those exporters because it is highly unlikely that Reserve Bank of India will allow rupee to appreciate quite dramatically? Because if the rupee appreciates, it will automatically challenge all the economic recovery. CAD problems will come to the fore and exporters will rendered extremely uncompetitive. What is your take on this?
 
 Prateek Agarwal: Yes, I would agree with you completely. The rupee has really appreciated to a level higher than was warranted. Policymakers themselves have been saying so. I thought they were comfortable when the rupee was at 60-61 kind of a band.
 
 It is vital for the economy that rupee stabilises at whatever level it touches. That alone can help people plan and export and grow. Extreme high degree of volatility in the rupee on the stronger side helps the market, but may not be good for the economy.
 
 We have seen what happened in the past when the rupee appreciated very sharply to 40. For some time, we had run a current account surplus but after that, the deficit became extremely huge. So, I am of the view that the rupee needs to stabilise. It should stabilise at current levels.
 
 After the sharp run-up in other parts of the market, exporters have been doing well. Markets have given them a miss. Perhaps it is time in terms of even sector rotation that the market looked at that pack."

Manoj Vaish new CEO of MCX; bourse to trim stake by January 18,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/manoj-vaish-new-ceo-of-mcx-bourse-to-trim-stake-by-january-18/articleshow/28299050.cms,m.economictimes.com,Manoj Vaish new CEO of MCX; bourse to trim stake by January 18,"MUMBAI: The bankers-dominated selection committee of the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) today elected Manoj Vaish as the new managing director and CEO of the exchange that is under the regulatory glare following troubles at the promoter group. 

 The regulator FMC had late last month said the promoter Jignesh Shah and the promoter group Financial Technologies were not ""fit and proper"" to run not only the crippled NSEL but also MCX and any other exchange in the country. 

 After a marathon board meet that lasted over six hours today, the new MCX board, comprising representatives of various banks, selected Manoj Vaish, who at present is the managing director of NSDL Database Management. 

 Vaish was an executive director of the BSE between 1998 and 2004 and CEO of financial services research firm Dun & Bradsheet. 

 The board interviewed seven candidates and three were shortlisted -- Dilip Bhatia, CEO of Ace Commodities Exchange; Anil Mishra, managing director and CEO of National Multi-Commodity Exchange and Manoj Vaish, sources said. 

 The interviews were conducted after Shreekant Javalgekar stepped down as the MD and CEO of MCX following the Rs 5,600-crore scam at its sister concern the National Spot Exchange (NSEL), co-promoted by MCX promoter Financial Technologies, in late July. 

 More than 70 people had applied for the top job at MCX, including two exchange insiders, a former National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) chief and officials of Reliance Commodities, IFCI, Central Depository Services and NSDL Database Management, sources said. 

 While Satyanand Mishra was appointed MCX chairman late last year, the selection of the new MD was important as FTIL promoter has already been declared as not fit and proper to run the exchange. 

 The board was also expected to consider FTIL and MCX stake dilution in MCX-SX, as per Sebi order. But nothing could be confirmed regarding this. 

 FTIL holds 26 per cent stake in MCX, which FMC had asked them to be brought down to 2 per cent. The board meeting however, decided to trim the promoters' stake to 5 per cent by January 18, according to sources."

Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel,” says Dhananjay Sinha, Director & Head of Strategy Research and Chief Economist, Systematix Shares and Stock

What is your view on the long-term trajectory for IT? The IT pack has undergone a considerable correction. Over the last year, the IT sector has been the worst performing after a very good run. So the IT sector has come down quite a bit and it has absorbed a lot of negative news. The key concern out here is with respect to the impending recession and the slowdown in the US and Europe. 
 
People have raised concern about their sales growth, etc. As of now, the IT companies, be it largecaps or midcaps, have not really sounded alarm with respect to their outlook. They appear to be fairly resilient. But the market is concerned about the outlook with respect to revenue growth. Of course, there is an issue with respect to margins. which is largely a factor of the boom that we saw last year.
 
That is broadly in the price but on a relative basis, the valuations have come down quite a bit. Large names have corrected from a PE valuation with a forward standpoint from something like 30-34 levels to currently about 24-23 levels. It has come down. There is still some amount of downside in valuation that is there. So maybe a 5-10% downside is possible but it is approaching a value zone as far as the IT sector is concerned. One should look at the largecaps.
 

How would you approach metals now given that on one side, there is a demand challenge and on the other side, there is a recession fear?With respect to metals, I have been an underweight for the last one year. We are looking at deceleration in the manufacturing sector across the world. If you look at the PMIs in developed markets, in Europe, the US and China, there has been significant deceleration and a marked contraction as well in major countries.
 
So the demand for metal is likely to be under pressure. If you look at various markets, there has been almost like a 40-50% correction in steel prices. Also with respect to aluminium, zinc, etc, there has been a considerable contraction. So I think metal space actually did very well last year, from an Indian player standpoint they benefited a lot through a large amount of exports and stuff. Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel. There is a glut in the domestic market and we are seeing that steel imports are also happening from China. 
 
There is intense competition and I have been a sell on steel and metal companies. I would continue to be so going forward because when central banks the world over are fighting inflation, commodities would not do well. For me, commodities in general and metals are underweight. So on any rise in steel and other metal stocks, I would sell.


The big macro concern, what is happening to the pound? How is the UK economy becoming topsy-turvy? What happens to companies which are dependent on the UK like Mastek, HCL Tech, TCS, Tata Motors?What we have to really put into context is that post Covid, Indian manufacturers actually enjoyed quite a bit of export exposure, especially given the context that there were fairly tight supply issues in the US, Europe and UK. There was a huge amount of fiscal stimulus. The volume growth for Indian manufacturers actually went up disproportionately.
 
ET Now: How would you view a business like Paytm? Purely the business, forget where the stock is headed?
Dhananjay Sinha: I think the Paytm business may do well. The best of volume growth is behind us, given the digitisation theme that was evident post Covid. A lot of that was being valued. Going forward, is this going to repeat the kind of buoyancy that we have seen earlier? I do not think so. Increasingly, the business model will have to be a function of what it does through the transactions, the buffer that it creates through transactions etc.
 
There are limitations with respect to what it can do. There are financial regulations that it will be subject to. So value creation from here on can be very limited.


What do you want to buy in a market decline?The risk of the market being on the downside is definitely there. We are looking at earnings cuts. In the first quarter, we have seen a 3.5% cut for Nifty earnings. We are looking at something like a 15% odd cut for the full year. So there is a downside as far as the market is concerned.
 
Secondly, given the context that the risk free rate is actually rising and more rate hikes will happen, the valuations might also be a challenge. Overall it would be relevant to be more defensive as far as the market is concerned. High beta sector such as metals, capital goods, industrials, mid and smallcaps are the things that will be relatively lower in my pecking order. 
 
I have been somewhat positive on urban consumption themes in autos, discretionary. Staples has done well, ITC continues to be a good value stock and continues to do well. Autos have done phenomenally well. Over the last year, I have reduced some overweight there. 
 
I would say that I am looking at pharma stocks at this juncture. There is a reasonable amount of visibility as far as the earnings are concerned and there are certain stocks which are available at good value and the sector has not done much over the last one year it comes at a good value. Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy, Ajanta and Indoco Remedies are some of the stocks that have come from our sort of pick. That is broadly the profile of things that we have in our portfolio.
 

Would you bet into oil consumers like Indigo?One should be looking at something like Asian Paints or Berger Paints because they have oil intermediates as inputs. They have a monopolistic market presence and pricing power etc. One should really look at such things. Asian Paints is something that I like in terms of valuations. Also, if you look at the market cap to sales ratio, what I look for has come down quite a bit over the last six odd months. 
 
So one would rarely get a chance in 20-30 years when we may see a sharp correction in such stocks. Any correction out here should be bought I would say so that is what you know I would play this oil with actually."

Kothari replaces SAIL chief C S Verma, who held the additional charge of CMD NMDC. 

 Earlier, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) has chosen Narendra Kothari, CEO of SAIL's Burnpur plant for the post of NMDC's CMD. NMDC, the country's largest iron ore miner, had been without a full-time chairman after retirement of its regular head Rana Som on December 31, 2011. 

 ""The Government of India has appointed Shri Narendra Kothari, CEO, SAIL as CMD on the Board of NMDC for a period of five years with effect from the date of assumption of charge of the post or till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier,"" NMDC said in a filing to the BSE. 

 In terms of the government order, Kothari has ""assumed charge of the post of CMD of NMDC on April 21, 2014,"" the miner said. It added that consequent to the development, Verma ceases to be CMD and Director of the Company with effect from April 21, 2014. 

 The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had in July 2011 suggested the name of M S Rana, CMD, Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India, for the post. But, the Steel Ministry was not in concurrence with the PESB's recommendation and instead gave company's Technical Director N K Nanda additional charge. 

 Following some issues that cropped up, SAIL Chief C S Verma was given the additional task and he continued at the helm of affairs of the country's top iron ore producer. Later, a panel headed by Planning Commission Member Arun Maira, recommended two candidates for the top job - Narendra Kothari and T K Lahiry, CMD of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd in May last year. NMDC produced 30.18 million tonnes (MT) iron ore in last fiscal and sold 30.50 MT of the key steel-making raw material."

  Do you really sense that perhaps on a long-term basis while right now fair enough the telecom balance sheets are looking overstretched but with 3G because that has higher efficiency than the current 2G? Your BWA can be used for WiMAX as well and be used for 4G. On a long-term basis, do you see a whole lot of value accretion? 
  
  Yes, absolutely. Now the telecom companies would have to really focus on the value-added services as opposed to pure volume gain that they have been used to in the past and, therefore, there is tremendous amount of innovation that these people can do and keep on improving the margins, so once this competitive pressure eases out, it has already begun to ease out. 
  
  Once it settles down and the balance sheet also starts improving, that would be a time to really get back into some of the leading names and stay invested for the long term."

 Currently, the bank has 1 lakh credit card customers and aims to increase the number to 5 lakh in the next 4-5 years.

ET Now: Do you think the secular rally in cyclicals is now coming to an end, and cyclicals in general are getting slightly exhausted? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: This has been our long-held view. I can give you some numbers for your convenience. Take two of the most expensive stocks in, let us say, a sector like FMCG, which most commentators will say is a very expensive sector. Take two of the very high-quality MNC names in the capital goods space. Have an optimistic projection for capital goods by which I mean 15% plus kind of sales growth, margins which are way higher than the current margins and average margins. Then look at what kind of profits are arrived at and what kind of valuation they trade versus FMCG. 

 So, if you compare the two you would find the FMCG story to be much more compelling. I am in no way saying that it is cheap. Actually the so called defensive part of the market today trades cheaper than the cyclical part of the market. Pharmaceuticals are valued very nicely, IT is cheap while growth there may be an issue. Sectors like capital goods and public sector banks are trading at valuations which will probably make these sectors — in the best case scenario — move sideways for some length of time."

ET Now: What do you do with infra, stocks like IDFC and couple of other infra finances have corrected a quite a bit, still stay away from them? 

 
Sonam Udasi: No, it really depends on what is your perspective on the market. Our perspective is that in the near term despite what we have seen today, there is not much scope for you to rally further, you can do a 100 points here or there that said with the currency where it is and you are heading into an election year, despite the trade deficit coming where it is, it is likely that it will be perking up in July and August as well and as investors realise that if dollar is to stay here, they will look at gold positively. 

 If you cannot do dollar then gold is a natural hedge against the dollar in that sense so I suspect that with that view in mind in the near term the pressure will continue on IDFC. You will see bouts of buying and selling. But if you have a longer view, say 1-1/2 year kind of view, these valuations on IDFC and some of the stocks like BOB, PNB, you will only find when they are under stress and once that starts to clear out which I suspect will happen over six to eight months from now. Then that is real investment. But for now, you could probably buy IDFC after seven days again at the similar price which was yesterday."

UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/upa-takes-sheen-off-psu-stocks-since-it-came-to-power-in-2004/articleshow/29540056.cms,m.economictimes.com,UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,"The government’s family jewels have lost some of their sheen in the past 10 years. Shares of state-run companies have underperformed the broader market since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power in 2004, an ET Intelligence Group analysts shows. That comes after the PSU index outpaced the BSE Sensex by a huge margin during 1999-2004, when the BJP was heading the ruling coalition.
 
 The PSU index rose 60 per cent in the first term of the UPA, whereas the Sensex rose at double that pace during those five years starting 2004. Under UPA-II, the PSU index lost 6 per cent so far, compared with a 73 per cent gain in the benchmark.
 
 During the NDA rule, the PSU index that exists since February 1999 jumped more than 300 per cent, compared with a 70 per cent gain in the benchmark index. Base effect played a part in these comparisons, but there were other reasons as well that influenced the performance of PSU stocks during the UPA and NDA rules, an analyst said.
 
 ""The outperformance of PSUs starting 1999 was on the background of a severe industrial slowdown that had led a large number of companies into distress,"" said Phani Sekhar, fund manager of portfolio management services at Angel Broking.
 
 For instance, he said, the shares of Steel Authority of India were trading below their face value and banks were grappling with very high non-performing assets at that time, so ""a part of their subsequent out-performance was on a lower base"". However, he said, the NDA government also had a stated privatisation policy and it carried out privatisations of companies such as Hindustan Zinc and Maruti Suzuki, making PSUs lucrative for investors.
 
 ""This, along with improving GDP growth, helped PSUs to outperform."" Under the UPA’s first term, the department of disinvestment was closed down, he said. ""Environmental issues and policy flip-flops impacted investor perception towards PSUs, which were already richly priced.
 
 In the last couple of years, FPO (follow-up public offer) announcements destroyed valuations due to lack of buying appetite,"" Sekhar added. The BSE PSU index currently comprises 59 shares with Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Coal India , State Bank of India, NTPC and NMDC representing the top five constituents.
 
 Unlike other indices, which consider free-float market capitalisation of the constituents, the BSE-PSU index is based on full market capitalisation of its constituents and consists of PSUs from the BSE500 group. The data analysed by ETIG exclude those of banks due to their different reporting structure, and companies such as Coal India, Oil India and NHPC, which got listed mid way.
 
 
 As the data suggest, the last five years under the UPA-2 have been particularly bad for PSUs, although the government kept selling more shares in these companies in a bid to tide over a burgeoning fiscal deficit. The financials of these PSUs have also shown a steady decline in the second term of the UPA.
 
 Total return on equity and return on capital have shown a steady year-on-year decline from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2013. ""This is because the government did not create a regulatory environment suitable for doing business,"" blamed Sankaran Naren, chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential.
 
 Currently, they are a good value buy, but there is always the government risk existing in these stocks, he added. The return on equity and return on capital employed are important ratios that capture the amount of profits generated by a corporate per unit of investment made in it. Higher the ratio, the better. The price-to-book value of these companies has fallen to 1.2 now from 2 in 2009.
 
 In fact, the market values of a few companies such as SAIL, Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil and Nalco have dropped below their book value. Book value is the total net worth of a company and is calculated by adding reserves and surplus to the share capital. PSUs’ growing debt levels were another key factor making investors nervous.
 
 The debt of 53 listed PSUs — net of cash and bank balance — jumped over three-fold to Rs 2.64 lakh crore at the end of March 2013 from Rs 85,000 crore at the end of fiscal 2009. The biggest debt amassers were from two important industries — petroleum and power — which have seen policy-led impediments.
 
 Indian Oil, BPCL, HPCL, Power Grid and NTPC together held Rs 2.82 lakh crore net debt at end-March , more than doubled since fiscal 2009. On the other extreme, the top five cash-rich PSUs witnessed 80 per cent growth in their idle cash position between FY09 and FY13. It were the remaining 43 PSUs that witnessed a spurt in indebtedness, from less than Rs 1,500 crore in FY09 to Rs 86,000 crore in FY13.
 
 The most notable names turning from cashrich to highly indebted in this period include SAIL, Shipping Corporation and MTNL. This doesn’t mean the lot will continue to under-perform. ""Health-wise , the PSUs are much better placed today compared with 1998-99 ,"" said Angel’s Sekhar. ""It is regrettable that they are underperforming their potential. Given some policy clarity, they have the potential to out-perform once again."""
Want to bet on Infosys? Five reasons why you should wait and watch,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/want-to-bet-on-infosys-five-reasons-why-you-should-wait-and-watch/articleshow/36437210.cms,m.economictimes.com,Want to bet on Infosys? Five reasons why you should wait and watch,"NEW DELHI: The appointment of Vishal Sikka as the CEO and MD of India’s second largest software exporter has come as a fresh ray of light for the investors of Infosys as it clears the underlying uncertainty, but it will be a long haul before any meaningful recovery can be seen in the stock.

Infosys, which wore the tag of IT bellwether some time back, is now struggling to regain confidence of its investors. India’s second largest IT exporting company has been witnessing a tepid growth in sales and profits since the past four years.

The stock has plunged a little over 18 per cent from its peak of Rs 3847.20 recorded on 3 March 2014, marred by a series of senior level exits and slowdown in sales. On YTD basis, Infosys is down a little over 9 per cent, as of data collected on 11 June.

""Vishal Sikka will be the next CEO of Infosys. This could likely be a long haul even if he’s the right man for the jog,"" said JP Morgan in a report. Even if he is the right man for the CEO job at Infosys, time will only say so. We believe this might be a really long haul for both Dr. Sikka and Infosys, added the report.

Vishal Sikka, a former SAP AG executive board member, was on Thursday appointed as Infosys’ Chief Executive Officer and MD. With his appointment, Sikka becomes the first non-founder CEO of Infosys.

The company also announced that Executive Chairman NR Narayana Murthy and Executive Vice Chairman S Gopalakrishnan would step down on June 14. Rohan Murty will also leave the company on June 14.

We have collated five possible reasons why Infosys will remain subdued in the short term, but remains a good long-term bet:

Building the right team: The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock at least for the time being and building the right team will be most important task in light of the recent senior-level exits. Infosys is a more of service-led company and Vishal Sikka comes from a product background, which is very different from the services business.

""Rebuilding the team will be a major challenge for him since the core team has left the company. Vishal has to build his own team and that is very important because one person cannot change a large company like Infosys,"" said Former Infosys Board Member V Balakrishnan.

""He also has to quickly connect with the clients and give them comfort, because clients have been worried since the leadership transition took a long time,"" he added.

Balakrishnan is of the view that Vishal, with his pedigree, looks like the right person for this role, but the jury is still not out on whether he will be able to perform to his full potential.

In light of the recent top-level exits, Mr. Sikka’s first job would be to comfort the people and tell them that the company has faith in them despite the bad stretch. The challenge is to get the people believe in themselves and that they are for keeps.


	 

""This is the turning point for the company and calls for re-rating of the stock. However, the board also needs to get reconstituted in a manner that it has more independent ‘directors’ than what it has had at this point of time,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Consulting.

""The same board is not going to fix the problem, even if the CEO is different. Once you get the ghost out of the closet completely, you will find this company flying again,"" he added.



Brokerages are positive despite near-term concerns: 

Despite recent exits, most brokerage firms are positive on the stock and have a target price of Rs 3500-4000 for a period of the next 12 months.

Earlier in the month of June, Prasad Thrikutam, the global head for sales and marketing at Infosys, resigned from the company. Thrikutam’s exit came a week after Infosys President and CEO-hopeful BG Srinivas resigned and was the 12th senior-level exit after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to the company as the executive chairman last June.



				


JP Morgan has an ‘overweight’ rating on the stock and a target price of Rs 4000 by March 2015. Infosys appears to have more realistic targets in the current environment, which we believe is positive.

Their price target is based on a one-year forward P/E of 16.5x, at a modest (15%) discount to TCS’ target multiple of 19.0x. They believe that the discount is justified as TCS’ revenue growth and margin profile are better than that of Infosys.

IndiaNivesh is of the view that the stock is trading at 14.8x FY15E and 12.9x FY16E earnings estimates. Given the stable global environment, they are of the view that Infosys FY15 guidance is a bit on the conservative side. Hence they expect the upward revision in the guidance going ahead.

The brokerage firm has a 'BUY' rating on the stock with a target price to Rs.3,952 (valuing at 16.4x FY16E EPS).

May lead to more senior-level exits:

Infosys had been evaluating internal candidates for the CEO position as well and appointment of Dr. Sikka might drive another wave of resignation from the internal CEO hopefuls. So, the biggest challenge for Infosys will be of retaining talent.

However, the organization will likely stabilize after that, say experts. JP Morgan is of the view that Mr. Murthy’s stepping down should provide significant freedom to Dr. Sikka to rebuild the organization as per his vision.

Ankit Pandey of Quant Broking is of the view that there is still some uncertainty that will remain over the next three to four months. More people may decide to leave, he added.

""But there needs to be more hiring as well, especially because they have lost so many people at the top,"" added Pandey. So over the next six to nine months, there will be a lot of travelling, a lot of meeting with the clients and getting to know the company as a whole,"" he explained.


	 

Slowdown in growth likely to continue:

The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock for the time being, but revival in growth will take its time.

Although Dr. Sikka would bring in fresh thinking to the organization as a technology visionary, but being an outsider he would likely take time to figure out Infosys’ issues, culture, ways of working, politics, competitive landscape, onerous task of rebuilding a team - all of which will take time to show results. JpMorgan believes that Infosys’ expected recovery to industry-level revenue growth by FY16E will likely get pushed out further (maybe to FY17E or even beyond). All in all, they believe the company will take a longer-than-earlier expected time to get back to the respectable growth trajectory.

Apart from his valuable experience at SAP, Mr. Sikka will bring along his entrepreneur like visibility and proven success in tough global markets to the company.

""Although under his helm, Infosys may witness an improvement in performance through transition of activities, we believe that it may take time for the company to return to its growth trajectory,"" Microsec Capital said in a report.

""For the stock, the development is expected to remain positive in the near to medium term. However, the long term movement of the stock will continue to be determined by Infosys performance and improvement checkpoints in the quarters to come,"" added the report.

Sikka will be instrumental in boosting sales:

The appointment of Dr. Vishal Sikka's as the CEO and MD (designate) of Infosys is a positive development for the company and being a former SAP AG board member, analysts and industry experts expect him help the company win business from his former customers at SAP.

He will bring an innovation focus to the former IT industry bellwether, at a time when the industry is undergoing fundamental changes, ET reported.

In addition, his strong client relationships can help Infosys win business with new and old customers and improve revenue growth, Deutsche Bank said in a report. However, with his products background, we are concerned about Mr. Sikka’s ability to run a services company, it said.

Investors will now seek direction and clarifications from the new management on addressing issues of (a) high attrition, especially in sales, (b) loss of business and strategic vendor status from existing customers impacting revenue growth and (c) below par presence and acceptance in key growth market continental Europe, added the Deutsche Bank report."
"AirAsia offers 2 mn cheap tickets, fly from Kolkata to Bangkok for Rs 3,300",neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/airasia-offers-two-million-cheap-tickets-to-south-east-asian-cities/articleshow/19325703.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,AirAsia offers two million cheap tickets to South East Asian cities,"NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of its India entry, Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia has opened bookings for two million seats between April 2 and 7, 2013 offering air tickets as cheap as Rs 3,300 to South East Asian destinations for travel next year.

One can fly from Kolkata to Bangkok for all-in-fare of Rs 3,300, Chennai to Bangkok for Rs 3,500, Bangalore to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 5,500 , Kolkata to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 5000, Kochi or Chennai to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 4500 and from Tiruchirapalli to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 4000, a statement by the budget carrier on Monday said.

“We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns in such a scale. It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” Siegtraund Teh, Group Chief Commercial Officer of AirAsia said.

“Free seats to domestic Malaysia destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru, Terengganu and more are also available from Kuala Lumpur . Only taxes and fees apply to these free seats, which will be available from INR 0 one way,” the statement added.

These tickets can be booked for a travel period of January 1–April 30, 2014, which, according to AirAsia officials is in line with the airline’s standard practise of encouraging advance bookings.

“This is a standard promotion offer all over the world for all routes and nothing to do with India entry as we may enter even before January next,” a company official said, declining to be named.


				

	
	The official also said that their offer was different from the one recently offered by Tiger Airways.
	
	In March, Singapore-based Tiger Airways opened a promotional offer for tickets to Singapore from Chennai, Kochi, Bangalore, Hyderabad Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchirapalli at $50 (Rs 2700) for travel between May 1st and December 15th. The tickets will be on offer until March 13.
	
	The scheme, which offered 10 seats on each flight, was one to celebrate five years of its Indian operations.
	
	In an earlier story, ET had reported that AirAsia’s standard practise is to open seat bookings a few months in advance at a nominal price, going up to ten times that sum near the flight day.

	 

	The idea is to stimulate the market with low fares till a certain percentage of seats are filled and then go to the highest levels. This is standard AirAsia practise across its network in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Japan arms, which would be later replicated in India.
	
	AirAsia flies 186 routes, covering 85 destinations throughout 18 countries.
	
	“We have predicted a fare war in the next 12 months. This is a precursor. AirAsia is stimulating the market in the backdrop of their India entry. Even if they sell 1 million seats at say Rs 4,000, we are looking at an upfront cash collection of Rs400 crore, which can help fund their India plans.

	
	This may force other Indian carriers to follow suit since the January-April period typically sees limited tourism traffic,” said Amber Dubey, partner and head (aviation) at global consultancy KPMG. Jet Airways, India’s secondlargest airline by market share, and Air India did not respond to ET’s queries. 


	Last Wednesday, the government cleared AirAsia’s proposal to start a passenger airline in India in partnership with the Tata Group and Telstra Tradeplace’s Arun Bhatia, whose son is married to the daughter of NRI billionaire Lakshmi Mittal. AirAsia will hold 49% stake, Tata Sons 30% and Bhatia 21% in the new venture.
	
	Rajan Mehra, a former India head for Qatar Airways and the managing director (India) for Universal Aviation — a business aviation services provider, said most airlines float such offers when they enter a new market. 


	“Such an offer is the best bet to make people aware that a customer-friendly airline is coming to town. So, in a way, it is a backhanded way of advertising their product. This could cause a cascading effect (in terms of response from other airlines),” Mehra said.
	
	Himanshu Singh, managing director of online travel portal Travelocity, concurred with Mehra’s views on AirAsia’s seat sale, but doubted whether Indian airlines would respond to the offer. “Indian carriers are mature enough not to react to such discounts. 
	 

	Given that AirAsia is entering India with a long-term plan, they will sooner or later look to tap passengers through a hub & spoke model, like Spice-Jet, and would want to fly Indians out. This scheme may well be the groundwork for that,” Singh surmised. “We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns at such a scale. 


	It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” said Siegtraund Teh, group chief commercial officer of AirAsia. “Free seats to domestic Malaysian destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru and Terengganu are also available from Kuala Lumpur.

ET Now: IT sector has disappointed a bit with results from IT biggies Wipro and HCL Technologies coming in a tad below market expectations. Now, it's Infosys, which is lined up for results on Friday. Do you think that the whole of IT pocket is now approaching the oversold territory? Will IT stocks see more downside or is the sector a structural short for some more months to come?
 
 
Ajay Bagga: IT firms may clock a growth of 12-15 per cent on the topline front; expect them to report a similar growth on the bottom line front. As far as margins are concerned, it seems that they do not have much scope for improvement at least in the next 12 months.
 
 Overall, the sector is getting rerated from a high-growth sector to a sector more like utility. Having said that, IT stocks will give you decent returns. There will be no negative surprises; IT firms have managements that are pro-minority shareholders. Looking at these factor , I would recommend investors to look at IT as a global play.
 
 An advisor to the RBI has recently said that rupee is overvalued. He said he would be happy if rupee drops to to 64-65 levels against the greenback.
 
 If this happens, then IT could be a good hedge for Indian investors. Consumers will lose purchasing power once rupee starts falling. Hence, keeping IT in your portfolio will help you.
 
 It is a natural hedge and it is a global growth story. So own IT stocks with that perspective, especially when domestic consumption is getting constraint the way it is. With the poor monsoon, the consumption space could be hurt even more. IT will give you some balance in the portfolio. Having said that, I do not expect them to be top performers.
 
 IT managements are clearly lacking inspirational wisdom. If you look at the US market, they give back $600 billion to shareholders every year via share buybacks. They pay $400 billion in dividends.
 
 If you are doing nothing and keeping surplus cash in fixed deposits or liquid funds at 8 per cent rate, then it is better give it back to the shareholders at least. Here, I am talking about domestic IT companies."

If one goes by the enthusiasm with which Rakesh Jhunjhunwala participated in the company's earnings conference call, it could well be his next Titan Industries.
 
 ""Sir, congratulations to you and your team on unbelievable results,'' said Jhunjhunwala. ""Is your better margins also reflecting the fact that you were utilising the same plants for higher production. Because, I've not seen any analyst report which highlights this, or no realisation of the fact that higher utilisation will give you much higher margins.""
 
 Jhunjhunwala, known as the Indian Buffett, follows some of the fundamentals of investing of Buffett, renowned for value-based investing. Buffett, the world's fourth richest man, stunned investors when he bought the rail company Burlington Santa Fe at the peak of 2008 credit crisis, when economies were contracting. But his bet proved talismanic with a boom in shale gas exploration making Burlington a money machine.
 
 Something similar could be in the making with Tata Motors, which is riding high on its pre-crisis acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover. The company though has been squeezed in the domestic economic slowdown, has been reporting record profits due to Jaguar Land Rover.
 
 Jhunjhunwala, who made a strong impression as a value investor with his ownership of Titan Industries and Crisil, has been favouring Tata Motors even as others were sceptical about the company’s ability to manage the JLR acquisition. Tata Steel, a group company, is still struggling after it acquired Corus Group in 2007.
 
 But it is altogether a different story at Tata Motors. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 4,805 crore, up 195%, as against a net profit of Rs 1,628 crore in the yearago period.
 
 A Jhunjhunwala questions also reflects his worry.
 
 “Are you not afraid that you’re going into too many segments, and your brand may be affected.” But the comforting management words were that both Jaguar and Range Rover vehicles will maintain their product appeal and the brand and the value they stand for."

ET Now: What is the first stock on your radar? Why is it that you like this stock?
 
 
G Chokkalingam: We like Moil. The stock has been underperforming the market for more than four years. The reason for selecting the stock is that I believe that manganese ore prices have bottomed out post the recent correction. The company has got huge cash as well. The cash itself is 80 per cent of the market cap. With Rs 20 EPS for the current year, if profit grows at that rate - which are very likely - the core assets of the company would be free in the next 1-2 years.
 
 The current market mcap would be equivalent to the free cash itself. In addition, we saw some forecast coming in from Chinese Steel Association last week. It said the Chinese capacity is going to be shut for at least 20 per cent of the total capacity. So I believe that in next six months, the metal outlook particularly for steel industry would start improving. This would be positive for Moil. Aalso this company has increased its capacity in the last two years. It has got new mines in Maharashtra. All these point towards a robust outlook for Moil."

Nobody is willing to wait for the final approval on the limit as this price may not be available then, hence the huge position built up in the derivatives market and in ADR,” said a US-based hedge fund manager, who did not wish to be identified. “If the limit is hiked the HDFC bank’s stock price and HDFC Bank’s ADR price should converge somewhere in between.” 

 HDFC Bank has proposed to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India for an increase in the FII limit to 74% from 49% currently. It is not clear, though, whether the parent HDFC’s 22% stake in the bank will be included in the overall holding of FIIs, who already own 77% of HDFC’s shares. A decision in favour of the bank, as many traders and analysts expect by September, will raise the limit for foreign investors. 

 HDFC Bank’s stock has remained range-bound in the past three months even as the benchmark BSE Sensex has gained 16% while its peers Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have given 30% and 17% returns respectively. 

 Analysts say that this trend could reverse in the coming months, with a possible increase in limit for FII holding, equity issuance and talks of merger with HDFC."
Forward Markets Commission to hire 20 experts on contract basis to ease staff crunch,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/forward-markets-commission-to-hire-20-experts-on-contract-basis-to-ease-staff-crunch/articleshow/33824763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Forward Markets Commission to hire 20 experts on contract basis to ease staff crunch,"NEW DELHI: Facing a major staff crunch when the NSEL's Rs 5,600 crore payment crisis has deepened, commodity markets regulator FMC has decided to recruit 20 experts and professionals on contract basis to assist it in legal, investigation and other matters. 

 The Forward Markets Commission (FMC), under the Finance Ministry, is functioning with less than 100 officers and staff against a sanctioned strength of 135. Vacant posts have not been filled due to poor responses to job advertisements. 

 To augment its manpower position for the discharge of regulatory functions, the FMC has posted an advertisement inviting applications for the engagement of 20 experts or professionals on contract basis. 

 FMC wants to hire six candidates each in the legal and inspection departments, two staffers in investigation and one each in monitoring and surveillance, cyber forensic, company secretary, statistician, human resources and information and communication technology, it said. 

 Experts and professionals would be recruited at various levels in Mumbai and Delhi. Initially, they would be recruited for one year, which can be extended as per requirements. The applicants should be below 60 years of age. 

 The government has received lukewarm responses to job advertisements posted regularly since 2005. Now that the workload has increased in the wake of the NSEL payment crisis, FMC has taken the contract route to recruit officers. 

 The regulator oversees the functioning of six national and 11 regional bourses in the country."

""We certainly see a turnaround time in 2013-14 fiscal subject to business condition,"" GMR Group Chief Financial Officer Amarthaluru Subbarao said. ""We expect fund raising to be completed over the next six to nine months,"" he said.

The Bangalore-based conglomerate has also embarked on an 'asset light and right strategy' for the future after having piled up net debt of Rs 33,600 crore.

It plans to raise around Rs 4,000 crore through stake sales by the end of current fiscal. This, along with higher earning from airport division after recent tariff revision, is expected to help GMR Infrastructure report profits next fiscal.

GMR Infrastructure, which operates India's largest airport in New Delhi, posted a consolidated net loss of 94 crore for the quarter ended June 2012, up from Rs 67 crore a year ago, due to higher tax paid by the company and losses incurred by Delhi airport and power divisions. The group plans to divest up to 21 per cent stake in GMR Infrastructure, which will bring down the promoter holding to 51 per cent. ""We do not have any specific target but we do not intend to go below 51 per cent at any point of time,"" Subbarao said. ""If we get appropriate price we will seriously consider the option. However, stake dilution will happen in tranches,"" he added.

The company's energy segment, which posted 156 per cent jump in its net loss at Rs 27 crore last quarter, is also scouting for investors to meet equity requirement of the ongoing power project and let private equity investors exit. The company requires Rs 1,500 crore equity to fund ongoing power projects over the next two year.

""We have an option of divesting up to 26 per cent at energy vertical through strategic investment, or bring investor at project level. We may also look at exiting projects like Island Power if required,"" Subbarao said.

GMR is also willing to divest up to 15 per cent stake in its Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils to a strategic investor.

The company is also in talks with investors to sell up to 74 per cent stake in its toll-based projects. Currently, road division contributes one-tenth of GMR's annual revenues. GMR Highways business has six toll- and four annuity-based projects either completed or under construction.

""NHAI allows us to divest majority stake at project level, if investors want controlling stake and meet our objectives we are open to hit,"" Subbarao said. ""We expect to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore through stake sale and will use it to meet equity requirement of Kishangarh-Udaipur-Ahmedabad road project,"" he added.

	 
Subbarao said the company is looking at asset light and right strategy for future projects. It now plans to pick up minority stake in infrastructure projects, run these for two-three years and exit with a premium. It may also look at owning majority stake in projects that have enough cash flow and do not require equity infusion.

GMR's debt has increased to Rs 32,900 crore in 2011-12 from Rs 3,700 crore five years earlier, according to a recent report by global financial service firm Credit Suisse."
Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gold-schemes-by-pm-modi-right-in-time-to-celebrate-dhanteras-d-k-aggarwal/articleshow/49697871.cms,m.economictimes.com,Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,"By D K Aggarwal
 
 Apart from physical gold, this Dhanteras – the gold and silver buying festival – one can also avail the benefit of investing into the recently-launched three gold-related schemes, including India gold coin bearing the Ashok Chakra (available in denominations of 5 gm and 10 gm), gold monetisation, and sovereign gold bond.
 
 Importantly, instead of buying gold in physical form, investors can now park their money in bonds that are backed by gold. The idea behind launching gold monetisation schemes (GMS) is to tap household gold, which has been estimated to be of around 22,000 tonnes.
 
 Moreover, the recently-launched sovereign bond scheme would offer the same benefits as physical gold and can be used as collateral for loans and can also be traded on stock exchanges.
 
 At the time of selling, customers can earn returns as per the current price of gold. This scheme would help shift part of the estimated 300 tonnes of physical gold, which is purchased every year (in the form of gold bars and coins) in the country for investment.
 
 At the same time, it will relieve investors of the need to check the quality of gold and with valuation. Gold monetisation would help individual to earn up to 2.50 per cent interest rate on their idle gold. Investors can invest for medium term (between 5 and 7 years) as well as long term (12-15 years tenure).
 
 This initiative is likely to increase the productivity of the commercial banks as well as of the NBFCs. NBFCs are authorised to collect the application form and submit in banks and post offices.
 
 It is expected that with the launch of these schemes, India would be able to check its current account deficit (CAD). Actually, Indians are obsessed with the physical gold and India has suppressed China in case of its appetite for it. To note, India’s current account deficit stood a record $190 billion in 2013.
 
 This has prompted the then UPA government to hike import duty on it to a record 10 per cent. The efforts of government have helped India to import an estimated $34 billion of gold during the year 2014-15 much lesser then the previously imported.
 
 To note, India is the world’s top gold consumer. It is in 10th position among the top 10 countries that hold the most gold in their central banks; the Reserve Bank of India holds 557.7 tonnes of the precious metal.

Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/income-tax-department-lens-on-rs-5-lakh-crore-share-sales-by-india-inc/articleshow/34394326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,"MUMBAI: More than 5,000 closely held companies will come under the glare of the income tax department for transferring funds through suspicious share-sale deals. According to information compiled by the tax office, about Rs 5 lakh crore changed hands in past six years as 26,000-odd unlisted firms belonging to large and mid-sized corporate houses transferred funds by issuing equity and preference shares at high premiums.
 
 Tax officers believe that as much as 25% of these transactions may not be genuine. They have come across deals where equity shares having a face value of Rs 1 were sold to another entity at a premium of Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 10 shares were issued at a premium of Rs 49 lakh, said a source aware of the ongoing I-T investigation.
 
 
Many share sale deals defy logic
 
 In two cases, involving the same corporate group, three shares of Rs 10 each were offered at a premium of more than Rs 100 crore a share. “There are many such deals that defy logic and it will be difficult for companies with little activity and capital of few lakhs to justify the premium,” said a government official.
 
 On April 25, ET had reported that the tax department, in a directive issued a day before the fiscal closing, questioned hundreds of companies on the premium collected against the sale of shares. The companies have been told to justify the premiums, failing which the amount would be treated as income and therefore taxed. The 26,000 cases relate to companies based in Maharashtra. More firms will be covered with the department’s offices in some of the northern states initiating similar procedures.
 

 Corporate groups often use their unlisted arms to enter into such transactions either to generate cash or convert unexplained cash into income. Say, entity A needs Rs 5 crore cash for a property deal or to arrange a payoff. While it has the money, it fears withdrawing the amount from bank would alert tax authorities. Instead, it strikes a deal with B, which has cash and is looking for a way to legitimise it. B issues shares to A, receives Rs 5 crore through official banking channels and pays A the amount in cash. Such deals are also used to
 
 bring back funds that may have earlier been siphoned out from a company. But three senior tax professionals ET spoke to said that such cases are unlikely to exceed 5% of total transactions. The department, according to them, has rattled many companies by putting a question mark on bona fide transactions such as issuance of shares to joint venture partners, promoters and financial investors.
 
 “Fewer shares with higher premium are also issued to keep the authorised capital low and reduce fees paid to the Registrar of Companies,” said one of the tax practitioners. The particular section in the law that empowers the department to demand taxes on unjustified premiums came into effect on April 1, 2013. But based on the Bombay High Court ruling in the case Major Metals Ltd versus Union of India, the department maintains that it has the power to tax cases related to unjustified premiums even prior to this date.
 
 According to the department, in a case where the share premium charged is in excess of their intrinsic valuation, there is ground for invoking the provisions of Section 68 of the Income-Tax Act, which requires the assessee to explain not only the ‘source’ of the credit entry but also its ‘nature’. The assessments that have been reopened pertain to those in 2008-09, which would have become time-barred after March 31, 2014. But the department is collecting data for subsequent years as well."
Infusion of additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders: Barclays,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/an-extra-1-trillion-to-indias-gdp-by-2020-makes-midcaps-hot-say-experts/articleshow/50090410.cms,m.economictimes.com,"An extra $1 trillion to India's GDP by 2020 makes midcaps hot, say experts","NEW DELHI: Consumption might become one of the biggest themes to track in the next 4-5 years, thanks to the government's reform push, feel experts. A renewed thrust to capital spending, they say, could add up to $1 trillion to India's GDP in the next 4-5 years.  	According to a report by Barclays, urban spending, reforms such as GST and government capital expenditure are all set to boost consumption.  	Midcaps are likely to benefit more out of the spending push.  	""The pay panel hike and One Rank One Pay (OROP) will aid consumer spend going forward, which could lead to infusion of an additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders,"" Barclays said.  	For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets  	The S&P BSE Midcap index rose over 4 per cent so far in 2015 compared to an over 7 per cent fall in the S&P BSE Sensex. Most of the midcaps stocks have pared gains but are still trading with gains of up to 70 per cent recorded in the last one year.  	Some of the midcaps that outperformed both Sensex, and BSE Midcap index include names such as Ashok Leyland (up 75%), Bajaj Finance (up 70%), 3M India (up 69%), Wockhardt (up 63%), and Britannia Industries (up 60%).  	""There are lot many opportunities in mid-cap space in various sectors, I am not denying that and these are completely bottom up opportunities in terms of sectors or in terms of companies themselves,"" said Parag Thakkar, Head-Institutional Sales, HDFC Securities.  	A large part of the success in the rally of midcap stocks can be attributed to domestic mutual funds that have poured in close to Rs 90,000 crore so far in the year 2015.  	According to the report, inflows in equity MFs in November stood at Rs 6,300 crore with AUM in the category rising by 1.5 per cent to a new high of Rs 4,03,000 crore.  	""If the trend continues of money coming into domestic funds, which have seen for the last 15 months or so then I suspect the mid-caps will continue to do well, because many of the mutual funds are quite adapt at finding the right ideas and putting money in mid-caps,"" said Sanjeev Prasad, Kotak Institutional Equities.  	""FPI investors typically look at large caps and as of now the indications are that you would not see too much of fresh money coming into emerging market funds but these things can always reverse,"" he added.  	While choosing which midcap stocks to invest, Prasad is of the view that investors should look buying stocks based on bottom-up analysis, and whether the stock price justifies the fundamentals at given point of time.  	Midcaps stocks usually perform well when economy is growing, and when public as well as private spending increases. But, additional funds up to $1trillion will certainly be beneficial for some of midcap names.  	Although, it is difficult to put a timeline as to when this amount of money will be come into India's GDP, but experts see it happening by the year 2020.  	""It will be difficult to precisely know when $1trillion will be added in the economy because of various developmental initiatives taken by the government, but by 2020 addition of $1 trillion looks achievable,"" said Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities.   	""Though, we believe pay commission effects will be just incremental as the payout this time will be staggered, but GST will bring in break through and cause far reaching changes in the economy.

Deven Choksey: It is possible that the de-allocation of JSPL could create disruption in their business. However, there is a possibility that instead of completely de-allocating and making the company suffer on the business front, they may probably go for the revised policy which may be an auction route in which the company may end up paying a little higher price but not asked to completely surrender the coal blocks. 

 Since we do not have clarity on this subject as yet, I would refrain from making any further comments on it. If the situation I mentioned earlier permits their economic value, it should not affect JSPL beyond a point."

 Meanwhile, on declines Bank Nifty should be bought, on rallies CNX IT should be sold so that is a broad idea you should have for trading but overall I do not see the market moving a whole lot in the next say 8-10 sessions."
Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/meera-sanyal-to-quit-royal-bank-of-scotland-for-a-full-time-career-in-politics/articleshow/19467763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,"MUMBAI: Meera Sanyal, the 51-year old banker who stunned political observers and bankers alike by contesting the South Mumbai constituency against Milind Deora in 2009, is hanging up her boots to plunge into political life ahead of the forthcoming general elections.
	
	The daughter of late Vice Admiral G Hiranandani, a gallantry award winner and author of works on Indian naval history, will quit as the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, India, to involve in socio-political life full time, said two people familiar with the matter. It is not known whether Sanyal, a member of the Indian Liberal Group, would join any political party.
	
	Sanyal, a fan of Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, shot into fame when she filed nomination papers to contest against Deora, son of Congress politician and former minister of Petroleum Murli Deora. She lost the elections in 2009, but not the spirit. She got 10,157 votes, or about 1.6 per cent of the total polled. Deora won. She chose to contest elections following dismay at the response of the authorities to the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 which killed 164 people and set the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi on fire.
	
	Sanyal, who had said that she had given a quarter century of her life to banking, will give the next quarter century to political life, could not be reached for comment.
	
	“Meera H Sanyal is relinquishing her executive responsibilities as Country Executive, to devote herself more fully to the social, economic and political causes in India, that she is passionate about,” a statement from RBS said. “We are in the process of finalising an external successor for this role and will announce that person in due course.” Meera will continue to chair the India Services Executive Committee and the RBS India Foundation.
	
	Some in the industry welcome her decision to jump to political life. “It’s terrific,"" said said Jamal Mecklai, CEO, Mecklai Financial Services. “The truth is India will not get anywhere unless educated people enter politics. A governance revolution has been ignited in India and she’s put her hat in the ring. I hope this inspires other people as well.""
	
	Born on October 15, 1961, Sanyal had her school education in Mumbai and New Delhi. Unlike many management aspirants who head to the US, she travelled to France to complete her management education from Insead. When she nearly gave up on job hunt and was about to return to the West, she had an offer from Grindlays Bank which led to a near three decade of banking career.

	 

	
	
	In 1992 she joined ABN Amro, that was acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland, and served in many departments including administration when she introduced hiring people with different abilities and weaker sections, though on merit. “She is cerebral, articulate and a sharp person,"" says a former colleague now with a rival who did not want to be identified. “Meera was always responsible for the administrative function. People who work under have good things to say.""
	Although she has not shared her political thought in public, given her background and her tweets, she may be closer to the liberal economic philosophy, than a welfare state approach.
	
	The Thatcher era comes to an end! Rest in peace Maggie - you reformed & liberalised politics & economics for an entire generation,'' Sanyal tweeted after the Britain's Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher died on Monday.
	
	Sanyal was also convenor of the Indian Liberal Group, an association of people with liberal thoughts, founded by Minoo Masani, especially when it comes to economic policies opposing Congress party's statist policies.
	
	Her commitment to policies may be strong, but to be politically successful in the poor dominated system, she may have to change her ways if she has to succeed.
	
	She'll have to lose those pearls first,'' said writer Shobha De before the 2009 elections. And switch to earthy, home spun salwar kameezes before that. But how on earth will she communicate her objectives to a constituency that has been spoilt and nurtured over decades by politicos with pockets as deep as the ocean?''"

A week ago, it had mobilised Rs 1,500 crore by offering the same securities.
 
 “We have got approval for Rs 3,769 crore collectively this year, and are raising it in two tranches as we did not collect the full amount in the first issue,” a senior company official told ET, confirming the second tranche of fund raising.
 
 The bonds will open for bidding on Wednesday as the coupon rate is expected to be fixed above 10-15 basis points higher than the benchmark government bonds.
 
 
 “The fixed spread finalised in the bidding process will be added to the average of two weeks' benchmark sovereign bonds estimated at 8.19%,” said an investment banker familiar with the matter, but didn't wish to be named.
 
 This means, the annualised yield could be at 8.50-8.51% compared with 8.41% in the earlier issue. MTNL securities are rated triple-A (Structured Obligation) by rating companies Crisil and Care.
 
 Structured Obligation signifies the government guarantee, which can be invoked when the issuer defaults in interest repayments.
 
 “The spread between the sovereign and government-guaranteed corporate bonds has contracted significantly to 10-20 bps from about 60 bps last year. This has helped issuers in terms of cost of borrowings,” said Ajay Manglunia, head -fixed income, Edelweiss Securities.
 
 “FIIs, which almost exhausted their investment limit in the G-Secs, are now investing in these securities.”
 
 Last week, FCI bonds slipped two bps below the similar government bonds on higher demand from overseas investors but later corrected a bit. Bond yields and prices move in opposite direction.
 
 MTNL, Food Corporation of India and Air India are three bond issuers who are in the same league, with all of them enjoying a sovereign guarantee status.
 
 Despite not being in the best of financial health, overseas investors rush to lap up these securities as they treat them as quasi-government securities.
 
 Earlier, big investors like HSBC, JPMorgan were seen investing in such issues."

 OVL last week concluded a $1.001 billion deal to buy US energy major Hess Corp's 2.7% stake in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in Azerbaijan, and 2.4% of the associated BTC pipeline. 

 ""It makes sense to raise cheaper debt through overseas bond issuance,"" OVL Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event here. The company had initially planned to issue its maiden overseas bond between January and March, but delayed it to complete the acquisition. 

 He said refinancing was easier since all of OVL's assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars. 

 The company, which gets most of its funds from its parent firm, has already appointed merchant bankers for raising the debt, a source said. ""There is no doubt that dollar debt is cheaper than rupee borrowings,"" he said. 

 The Azerbaijan acquisition was OVL's biggest since 2009 when it bought UK-listed, Russia-focused Imperial Energy for $2.1 billion. 

 ACG, which is located in the south Caspian Sea, about 95 km off the coast of Azerbaijan, is the largest oil and gas field complex in Azerbaijan and one of the largest producing oil fields in the world."
Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/quick-heal-may-be-indias-first-pure-software-co-to-take-the-ipo-route/articleshow/31860061.cms,m.economictimes.com,Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,"MUMBAI: A decade ago, it took Quick Heal time and hard work to convince software giant Microsoft that the small Indian outfit was serious about the business of building anti-virus software.
 
 Since then, Quick Heal, which started out as a gadget repair shop, has risen to become an IPO prospect, travelling a path that was far from easy. When they file their draft red herring prospectus in December, they might well be the first pure software products company from India to list, although others such as Mumbai-listed Persistent Systems build software for global customers.
 
 In 1990, Kailash Katkar, who says he barely passed his matriculation, started a calculator and computer repair shop with 15,000 from his savings. His younger brother Sanjay Katkar was studying computer science at an engineering college, and was working on an anti-virus project and often came to practice on the shop's computer.
 
 ""We noticed that every time Sanjay came, the computer would work properly and if he had not come for sometime there would be lots of problems. So, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just running these programmes he had created to clean out the viruses,"" said Kailash Katkar.
 
 That was how Quick Heal was born. The company initially sold the software along with annual maintenance contracts, a business that Katkar kept active until 1999 to fund the anti-virus business. ""When we started we couldn't get any money from banks. No one wanted to trust us. Now, they keep chasing us and we have to tell them that we don't need money,"" said Kailash, who is the CEO of the company, with his brother Sanjay taking on the role of chief technology officer.
 
 Quick Heal started at a time when there was no software product from India and little if any venture capital activity. The company received its first venture capital funding in 2010 from Sequoia, the same firm that recently boasted of nearly $3-billion payday from its investment in mobile messaging service, WhatsApp. Sequoia put in Rs 60 crore into Quick Heal, valuing the Pune-based company at Rs 600 crore at the time. That valuation has only grown in the last two years.
 
 
 

 
 ""The minimum they could expect is a Rs 1,200-crore valuation. It could be much more, depending on their actual numbers,"" said an investment banker, who declined to be identified. ""Product firms are rare but they are typically given a valuation of some multiples of revenue, but there is currently no benchmark for a company like Quick Heal in India,"" the banker said.
 
 The lack of a benchmark worries the Katkars, who are currently in the process of appointing independent directors and consultants to determine a valuation for the company. However, other IPOs such as the one for Just Dial have increased Quick Heal's confidence in its plans."
Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/reserve-bank-of-india-changes-in-gilt-auctions-seen-as-sign-of-stable-rates/articleshow/39221348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,"A couple of moves by the RBI while announcing Friday's auction for government securities (G-secs) has surprised the bond market.
 
 But dealers and analysts said that the indications, taken together, signify that the central bank is expecting a stable interest rate, at least over the next 12-18 months.
 
 On Monday , RBI announced that it will auction another lot of the new 10year paper, 8.40% GS 2024, worth Rs 9,000 crore, making it the second consecutive week of auctioning the same paper. This is probably the first time RBI has decided to auction the same paper over two successive weeks. The central bank has also moved from an uniform price auction to multiple price auction method for this Friday .
 
 Dealers said that the current yield on the new 10-year, which will be the new benchmark rate for the market, is at 8.43% per annum. In contrast, the old 10-year, which was the benchmark till last Friday , is trading at a yield of 8.71%. Ideally , the two benchmarks should not have such a large variation which at present is nearly 30 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point). “With more supply of the new 10-year in Friday's auction, this distortion will be corrected soon,“ a top dealer with a domestic bond house said.
 
 The RBI decision is also expected to increase the lifecycle of the new 10-year gilt and also the current 14-year.
 
 In all likelihood, the next 10year will be introduced only after eight-nine months, dealers said. Usually , RBI introduces two 10-year papers every year to indicate the benchmark rate that it is comfortable with. “If the RBI is extending the lifecycle of a 10-year, it is probably (another) indication that rates will be stable and hence it will not tweak with the benchmark paper,“ the dealer said.
 
 During auctions, usually the central bank also uses the uniform price method which ensures bond buyers get the gilts in the auction at an uniform yield. On the other hand, in multiple price auctions, while bidding bond houses should be more careful about the price they are willing to pay . By changing the bidding method, RBI is indicating bond players to be very careful about rates going forward, bond market players said."
Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-investors-should-assign-60-weightage-to-large-cap-stocks-in-their-portfolio-experts/articleshow/45759550.cms,m.economictimes.com,Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex, which rose 30 per cent in the calendar year 2014, looks all set to touch fresh record highs in the year 2015 and large cap stocks are likely to lead the rally, say experts.

For the year 2014, the Sensex outperformed with annual return of 30 per cent, whereas FD rates were 9 per cent and gold gave negative returns. There are typically five asset classes to choose from for retail investors, namely - equities, gold, fixed income, currency and commodities.

Equities as an asset class is likely to outperform other asset classes in the year 2015 and retail investors should look at buying quality stocks on every dip.

""For retail investors our advice is to invest wisely in equities, in 60:40 ratio - with 60% of portfolio to be assigned for large caps and 40% for mid-caps,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.

""In the year 2015 we are expecting good returns in the mid cap sector, but as risk is high, we cannot put high stakes on it. It is best to concentrate on solid stocks with great long-term growth potential and use the strategy of buying in dips,"" adds Gupta.

He further adds that mutual funds can also be a great option if direct market participation is not feasible or in case there is less risk appetite.

Considering the fact that equities are likely to outperform other asset classes, investors should remain cautious while picking stocks for their portfolio. One can look for a company that offers unique products or has a foothold in a niche market.

Consider stocks that are fundamentally solid - a strong cash position, little or no long-term debt, growing revenues, ongoing profitability, and a good growth strategy, say experts. It is also good to look for stocks that return income to investors in the form of a share repurchase program and dividends.

""Equities as an asset class are much more likely to outperform the other asset classes. Fixed income investments are being peddled by many on the basis that the RBI will cut interest rates and hence one should invest in them to capture the one-time upside to the principal,"" says Dr Vikas V Gupta, Executive Vice President at ArthVeda Fund Management Pvt. Ltd.

""However, go into equities with a consciousness of your own risk appetite and allocate a portion for the long-term. Start with a reasonable lump-sum of about 10-20 per cent of your financial corpus and then add SIPs so that in 6 months you have about 30% of the financial corpus,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that one should stick to index-oriented funds and safer large cap strategies. Small and midcaps also have a role in investors’ portfolio, but to a lesser extent.


	 

Experts across Dalal Street advise investors that they should not chase past returns; i.e. since BSE Small Cap has given 100% returns in the last one year, so one should not get enticed that that will continue in the future.

It is expected that 30 per cent CAGR in EPS is possible over the next 5 years, according to our market analysis, says Gupta. This is likely to provide very high returns over the next 5 years.

However, retail investors should develop their own understanding of equities and read up Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor before jumping lock-stock-and-barrel into equities, advise experts.

""As far as retail investors are concerned, the current set-up of Indian equity markets is unprecedented. The next three-five years look very good from the corporate growth and return perspective,"" says Vikas Khemani, Edelweiss Financial Services.

""People have to invest in equities. You can have a systematic investment plan. Obviously, one has to look at one’s own risk-reward profile. But in my opinion, for every retail investor, equity exposure has to be a significant part of their savings pool,"" he adds.

Khemani is of the view that at least 15% to 20% return over the next four-five years will come from equities. And the best part is that it is also tax free. So, equities are definitely a great asset class for any retail investor, he concludes."

Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: The dollar strength going past 89. What is your view on the rupee? 

 
Manoj Rane: The rupee is one of the few currencies which has held up during this bout of dollar strengthening. We have seen about a 3 per cent depreciation from a 60 level. It is nothing compared to what where the Yen is today. It is almost 120 and the euro is 1.23. So you have seen 10 to 15 per cent depreciation against the dollar for other currencies. In fact INR is one of the currencies which would have strengthened against most other currencies other than USD.
 
 We are so USD focus that we do react a lot to whatever weakness we see even on an intraday basis on the currency side. The good news is that 62 continues to be supported. I am not sure when I say that whether it is really good news or bad news because a certain weakness or slight weakness in the currency is in my mind good for the country, trade and our current account deficit. So to that extent I do think this level will possibly hold the currency on an around 62. I do not expect significant depreciation from here."

ET Now: From a sectoral point of view, what would you bet big on keeping the budget in mind? Do you think there is going to be any sector-impacting news, because a lot has already come in, such as the extension of duty cuts on autos till December? 

 
Anish Damania: This budget is going to drive the roadmap for the next five years. I would really like to see how the budget pans out. I want to see what the Budget does about investment expenditure. It may go about it by raising tax revenue or cutting wasteful expenditure, and allocating the amount towards investment. 

 I also want to see what the budget does about fiscal deficits and how it proposes to prime the economy. 

 These are the various steps that I am looking at. I am not comfortable with the scenario where the government will expect a higher revenue growth than the 10-11% out of the taxes. It is not going to be that easy to increase tax revenues as much as expected. So I also want to see the divestment targets of this government. I want them to be very aggressive because there is liquidity. They need to harness this global liquidity in their favour. 

 Last year, it was about Rs 276 billion. I am expecting that this year they will target close to Rs 700 billion or so in terms of divestments. I want to see those kind of numbers in the Budget. I think the areas where divestment happens are going to be the ones that will become more attractive."

  Three IPOs are lined up for today. Some of the anchor investors are pure hedge funds, who sell 10 days after they buy. So, should you look at anchor investors and when you look at them, should you rather prefer investors who do not buy and sell?
   
  Obviously, these funds have some kind of a legacy, some kind of a credibility in the market place. If there are better names on the side of anchor investors, then one tends to feel more comfortable. A similar case applies elsewhere also. If there is a great guy getting into a particular product, you do not mind getting into it because the great guy has got it but if the hedge funds are, the ones who are becoming anchor investors and at times we also hear that these are back-to-back arrangements from the promoter group within the fund, they are IAR, which are absolutely predetermined. There are all kinds of things that happen that we keep hearing about from time to time, so one has to be very careful. If the quality anchor investors are there, definitely it is more comforting from the retail investor’s standpoint."

 This includes how much the company is spending on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a percentage of its net profit, the number of stakeholders' complaints received and resolved, details of any pending case filed by stakeholder against any unfair trade practice, irresponsible advertising or anti-competitive behaviour adopted by the company. 

 This will enable the shareholders to have a better understanding of the manner in which their companies' function and adopt responsible business practices. 

 The circular dated August 13 exhorts the companies to follow the national voluntary guidelines on social, environmental and economic responsibility that have been formulated by ministry of corporate affairs in July 2011. 

 Companies are expected to share information like number of employees hired on temporary or contractual basis, any legal notices received from pollution control boards and number of consumer complaints pending at the end of the fiscal. 

 While most leading companies like L&T, HUL, Dr Reddy's Labs, Tata Motors, ITC and ICICI Bank are already publishing a separate sustainability report along with their annual reports, the circular will make it compulsory for all top 100 companies to report their responsibility initiatives and also bring in certain uniformity in their reporting. 

 ""It is a step in the right direction by the SEBI. However, it is not a surprise. The industry knew that something like this was coming,"" said the head of CSR division in a Nifty company. Most of the companies must be in the process of making themselves ready for such reporting. 

 If a company has to follow it, it has to start early as there has to be a system put in place and it is an initiative where the whole organization has to be involved, he added. 

 Under the structure that has been suggested, the companies also have to provide the details of the director responsible for implementation of the business responsibility policies. In case a company is not abiding by any of the principles to be reported, it has to explain the reasons of its failure to do so. 

 The Companies bill 2011, which is making it mandatory for certain companies to report their responsibility initiatives, is still pending approval from the parliament. Meanwhile SEBI through its circular has made business responsibility reporting mandatory for at least the large companies. 

 The circular shall be applicable with effect from fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2012. Sustainability experts expect the regulation to be progressively made applicable to all companies listed on the stock exchanges. The national voluntary guidelines are already applicable to all Indian companies including multinationals as well as small and medium enterprises. 

 The companies that already submit sustainability reports to their stakeholders based on internationally accepted reporting frameworks have to only map the principles contained in the national voluntary guidelines to their existing sustainability reports."

A consortium of state-owned insurers led, by New India Assurance, has emerged as the frontrunner for the national carrier’s business, while the private sector has rallied behind a group led by ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The insurance contract for the flag carrier’s 105-strong fleet comes up for renewal on October 1 at an estimated premium of about $25 million. 

 
Experts said the New India Assuranceled consortium has United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and National Insurance as co-insurers. The other group has ICICI Lombard General Insurance as lead insurer and Reliance General and HDFC Ergo as co-insurers. 

 The insurance companies ET spoke with on the matter declined to comment. However, a senior executive at a staterun insurer said the New India Assurance-led consortium was ahead in the race. 

 According to industry executives, aviation premiums have increased following arise in mishaps, pushing up the bill for insurers. For instance, in 2013 when the market had softened, Air India paid a premium of $23 million. This was lower by over $1 million than the premium in 2010 when an Air India Express jet crashed in Mangalore killing 158 people. 

 General insurers led by Reliance General that had provided cover to Air India in 2010 had to pay Rs 350-400 crore in compensation claims. Most of the claim money came from international reinsurers who dictate rates depending on the state of the market. 

 Air India’s current insurance policy, issued by New India Assurance, includes a $9.5-billion hull cover and a combined single liability of $1.5 billion. 

 Hull all-risk insurance covers any damage to the body of the aircraft caused by an accident, while war risk, part of hull cover, insures against war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. In addition, the insurance covers liability toward passengers and covers legal protection against suits. 

 A series of aviation disasters this year—the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in March, the crash of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft in Ukraine in July and that of an Air Algeria plane in Mali in the same month—have turned aviation insurers wary."

 The Reserve Bank of India has on Wednesday released a market borrowing calendar stating that state governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, will sell about Rs 95,000-1,05,000 crore worth of bonds between January and March next year through central bank auction system. 

 With this higher-than-expected capital market fund mop-ups, investors including insurers, pension funds would be flooded with excess supply of securities. Markets were expecting state bond sales in the range of Rs 65,000-75,000 crore in the fourth quarter. 

 “The amount of proposed bond sales is higher than market expectations,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, analyst, interest rates, SBI DFHI Primary Dealers. “The excess supply along with other securities will help future investors to earn higher.” 

 “Issuers may have to fork out higher rates to woo investors as the yield curve would remain elevated,” he said. By March, markets could also see Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore worth of ‘discom’ bonds coming out of state-owned power distribution companies under the bailout scheme christened as “Uday”. Moreover, tax free bonds are already attracting retail investors with a cumulative Rs 40,000 crore issuances expected by financial yearend. The central government too will issue about Rs 80,000-85,000 crore routine sovereign bonds between January and February, dealers said. 

 Excess supply will lead to rise in bond yields pushing prices down in the existing bonds. 

 New tax free bonds may now have to offer higher rates as those are priced in link with the benchmark bond yield. State bonds are now yielding 8.25-8.27% half yearly, which about 50 basis points higher than the benchmark sovereign yield. 

 During October-December quarter such bond sales was in the range Rs 75,000-80,000. About six months ago, for the first time, the central bank had issued a tentative calendar for selling state securities in line with central government bonds. In the July-September quarter, 10 states and one of the union territories had sold Rs 45,000-50,000 crore bonds. State bonds are mostly of 10-year maturities while states like Gujarat and Karnataka have introduced five-year papers too."

Pankaj Pandey: Largely if you look at there are some segments which do well at a certain point in time and then there are certain segments which become a drag so similarly for example it looks like that metal as a pack might be a sort of a drag on the company.  	Earlier you had oil and gas which was posing challenges for the company, but largely if you look at what we are expecting is that in this particular quarter things would remain soft for the company and it is largely a soft quarter.  	But in terms of order inflows, it will be similar to what has happened in the last quarter so about 11500 odd crores that is what the company has disclosed, so we are expecting about 4 to 5% top line growth and a similar bottom line growth with same margins.  	The key takeaway going forward will be that over the next three to six months, we would expect a lot of announcements to happen on the ordering side which is where we would expect this company to do far better, which is why we would expect that probably the demand would continue to hold its guidance of 15% order growth and we are expecting a similar sort of top line growth and a shade below margin and a shade below profit growth.

Inox Wind’s IPO was oversubscribed 35 times. It closed at Rs 438 — 35% higher than its offer price on Thursday. Another example is of Marico Kaya, a subsidiary of Marico which was listed in July 2014. The stock has so far gained 750%. Intellect Design, a subsidiary of Polaris Consulting Services, has gained 70% since its listing in December 2014.
 
 Spinning off the less profitable business once it turns around and becomes self-sustainable not only creates value for the shareholders of the new listed entity but also for the shareholders of the parent company. ETIG has identified some of the companies that may see a potential separate listing of the smaller or less profitable businesses.
 
 
Eicher Motors
 
 For Eicher Motors, separate listing of its commercial vehicle business could be a game changer. The bike business may be around one-third of the top-line, but contributed 90% to the entire profit in CY14. According to analysts, the bike business will grow at least 60% for the next two years (it grew by 100% in CY14) and should get a P/E multiple of 25 on FY17 earnings.
 
 This means, the bike business on a standalone basis is valued at Rs 36,000 crore. Considering this, the commercial vehicle business is valued at only Rs 6,500 crore (the current market capitalisation of Rs 42,500 crore lessRs 36,000 crore of bike business valuation). The commercial vehicle business, which is a joint venture with Swedish auto giant Volvo, gives two-thirds of Eicher’s total sales and has already started to show a turnaround.
 
 

HSIL
 
 HSIL is the biggest player in the sanitary ware business with close to 60% market share and the highest margin in the industry. But, it has a market capitalisation less than its peer – Cera Sanitaryware. This is because HSIL also has a glass business which was loss-making till a few quarters ago with a debt of close to Rs 800 crore.
 
 In the glass packaging business it is one of the top two players in the country. It became loss-making two years ago after the industry capacity increased amid the demand slowdown. However, now the glass industry has consolidated with only few players and the demand is improving. HSIL’s glass business has shown a strong turnaround. The recent institutional placement will bring down the debt significantly. In the past, the management has mentioned about demerging the two businesses.

 Since the time Tata Global Beverages and Starbucks signed the joint venture in India, Tata Global Beverages’ market capitalisation has remained almost stagnant. Analysts are not giving the full valuation to the Starbucks business, which has already opened close to 70 stores and 70% of that in the last one year.
 
 The company is expected to have 400 Starbucks outlets by FY18 and achieve breakeven. Once that happens, there could be a separate listing of Starbucks. Jubilant FoodWorks with close to 800 stores is valued at over Rs 10,000 crore and Tata Global Beverages together with its tea, coffee and Starbucks businesses is valued at Rs 9,300 crore."

 Nasdaq’s entry into the India market comes at a time when the US-based stock exchange is looking to expand its footprint in emerging markets including India. Industry insiders believe that the exchange is hoping to cash-in on the optimism fueling the technology sector and get manystart-ups access capital by helping them get listed at the stock market. 

 ""We look forward to the long-term opportunities our presence in Bangalore will provide for us,"" said Robert Frojd, regional manager, Southeast Asia for NASDAQ OMX. 

 Details of the management at the India office were not mentioned in the press release. An email was sent to the Nasdaq this morning, before US working hours. 

 Nasdaq first opened its Bangalore office in 2001 and was present until the year 2009. However, in the eight years Nasdaq was present on the ground, the exchange could not get any Indian firm listed on its stock exchange, according to data from Dealogic and the Nasdaq’s website. 

 This was primarily because experts believed there very few incentives for the companies to get listed, with the problems getting exacerbated by the the many regulatory bottlenecks ahead of the India firms to get listed in the US. 

 However, this time many believe the exchange could find success and get firms access to capital as the exchange may have learnt from its mistakes during the first stint. 

 Kiran Karnik, a former president of India’s software industry association body Nasscom said the decision to set up an office in India, after having gone through a turmoil, is an optimistic step. 

 ""For startups in Bangalore, especially the one’s that are growing fast, this is a great opportunity to get to Nasdaq,"" he said. 

 Over the past few years, Nasdaq has been expanding its presence beyond the US and European markets by wooing listings from companies in Southeast Asia. It has listed 8 Indian companies, including pharmaceutical firm Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, ICICI Bank and Sify Technologies . 

 India’s second largest software firm Infosys had moved its listing from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext's New York Stock Exchange in 2012 to increase its access to European investors. Infosys was replaced by Facebook on the Nasdaq-100 index."
NBFC Indostar plans to hit market with rs 1K crore public issue in June '16,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nbfc-indostar-plans-to-hit-market-with-rs-1k-crore-public-issue-in-june-16/articleshow/49639916.cms,m.economictimes.com,NBFC Indostar plans to hit market with rs 1K crore public issue in June '16,"MUMBAI: Non-banking finance company Indostar Capital Finance, promoted by Everstone Capital, has kicked off the process of launching an initial public offer of Rs 1,000 crore. Investors have invited banks to pitch for the mandate this week, said two people close to the development. 

 On the back of growing investor demand for financial services companies, the promoters see an IPO as the best option to raise capital. If the company files for an IPO, it will become the first sizeable nonbanking financial company (NBFC) to list in the last four years. 

 Founded in 2010 by Everstone Capital, Indostar provides long term funding to Indian businesses and infrastructure projects. ""The presentations from bankers will be made this week. A few banks will be appointed soon,"" said one of the persons. 

 ""Apart from four global banks, a couple of domestic banks will be appointed. The issue is expected to be launched around June 2016,"" said the second person. 

 Everstone Capital managing partner Dhanpal Jhaveri declined to comment. 

 Last year, Ashmore Capital, one of the founding partners of Indostar, exited the business by selling its stake to Everstone Capital and ACPI. Apart from Everstone and Goldman Sachs, Indostar is owned by Beacon India Private Equity Fund, ACPI and China Development Finance's investment arm CDIB. 

 Indostar's loan portfolio stood at Rs 3,375 crore on 31 March, according to an October ratings release by Care India. The company's net worth is more than Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Having focused on wholesale lending, the company is now increasingly looking at small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to diversify its loan portfolio. On March 31, around 30 per cent of loans were to the real estate sector, 66.5 per cent to corporate financing and 2.9 per cent was given out against shares. The company's vehicle finance portfolio was 0.2 per cent of the total. This is one reason why Indostar is able to maintain a healthy portfolio with gross nonperforming assets at 0.77 per cent and net non-performing assets at 0.064 per cent of total loans, experts said. 

 Indostar clocked around Rs 149 crore in post-tax profit in FY15, up from Rs 112 crore in the previous year. This growth was achieved on the back of total income of Rs 528 crore."

ET Now: What is your take on the auto stocks? How are you dissecting the game between four-wheelers and two-wheelers? Between four-wheelers too, it is a divide between CVs and passenger vehicles. Your thoughts? 

 
Rajat Rajgarhia: The top stocks in auto right now are very clear. They are Maruti and Tata Motors. As of Maruti — while the stock is at its all-time high — the volumes have been almost flat for the last four years. We think that over the next three-four years when the volume moves from the current 1.2 million to close to 2 million, the operating leverage along with a stable currency can do wonders to its earnings, and similarly, to the stock. 

 Same is the case with Tata Motors. JLR continues to hold on well, but the domestic business has been a drag. It will return with a big bang over the years to come. It means not just a higher earnings, but also a higher valuation for the stock. 

 M&M has also reported the July month volumes, with both UVs and tractors showing a decline. At this point of time, it would definitely not be on the priority list, because we will have to see how, at what point of time, both of their businesses start doing well. Generally the stock will only do well when you will see both these units growing into double digits. But that is not happening anytime in the near future. 

 To me, both Tata Motors and Maruti will keep on dragging for some more time."
"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-move-on-fast-track-rights-fpos-to-help-government-in-disinvestment-of-state-owned-companies/articleshow/42843402.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies","MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi is planning to allow more listed companies to raise funds through ‘fast track’ follow-on public offers (FPOs) and rights issues, provided issuers fulfil certain conditions. The proposed move could also make it easier for the government to divest stake in some of the state-owned companies.
 
 Companies having a free-float market capitalisation above Rs 250 crore will be able take this route, according to a regulatory official. This will make more than 300 listed companies eligible for the fast track fundraising option. Apart from meeting existing criteria, companies will also have to fulfil additional conditions – like, promoters will have to compulsorily subscribe to rights entitlement, the stock should not have been suspended from trading in the past three years due to regulatory violations, no conflict of interest should prevail between lead manager and issuer and promoters, and the company should not have settled any violation of securities law through consent mechanism.
 
 The regulator is keen to further reduce the time for processing offer documents for companies with good track record. At present, compliant listed companies satisfying certain specific conditions and having a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore are allowed to access the primary market in a time effective manner. Such companies can proceed with FPOs and rights issue by filing a copy of prospectus with stock exchanges and Sebi. They are not required to file draft offer document for Sebi comments.
 
 What is now being proposed is making rules simpler for a larger number of companies. “The fast track route will significantly shorten the fund-raising process for companies,” said Praveen Chakarvarty, a member of Sebi’s primary market advisory committee and former managing director of BNP Paribas.
 
 “Typically, for a company wishing to raise money through an FPO or rights issue (with Sebi review), the timeline is about 5-7 months, which is very long in the current environment,” said Sudhir Bassi, executive director-capital markets of the law firm Khaitan & Co. “In order to make FPO and rights issue more popular modes of raising funds by corporates, it would be useful if Sebi relaxes the eligibility requirements for fast track issuers.”
 
 The new rule on fast track issuances is expected to cover all PSUs, irrespective of their market capitalisation – a step that could facilitate the government's divestment programme. On the proposal on making it incumbent on promoters to subscribe to their rights entitlement, Chakarvarty said, “This is in line with international investing practices.”
 
 In 2012, the regulator had reduced the threshold of free-float market capitalisation for issuers accessing the market through fast-track FPOs and rights issues to Rs 3,000 crore from Rs 5,000 crore. Sebi had introduced the concept of fast track issues in 2007. The regulator is not in favour of making the fast track route available to all companies as the process involves restricted due diligence.
 
 But some experts feel all publicly traded companies should be able to avail this facility. “All listed companies should be allowed to use the fast track route. However, to be on the conservative side, the current threshold of market cap should definitely be lowered,” said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database. “If a company is already listed and trading is taking place on a daily basis, then there is enough information available in the public domain… why, then, should an FPO or rights issue require a detailed offer document and a Sebi approval?”"

Sandeep Wagle: I would say the Nifty is in a corrective mode in the short term. By short term, I mean the next day or two. A move towards 7400-7430, which is a very strong support area, cannot be ruled out. We are playing for that. 

 In case it does not happen, we will cut off the short position on Monday morning. But the weekly view is quite positive. The pattern till now suggests at most a small correction of 100 points. At those levels we would want to go long. 

 I would want to be stock-specific. So if the Nifty finds support at 7430-7400 levels, then I would look at covering a short position and going long, stressing on playing stock-specific."

ET Now: You are positive on Britannia Industries and, in the past, you have liked the stock at Rs 3,100 level. Is Britannia price to perfection?  Mayuresh Joshi: Britannia Industries' valuations are close to 36-odd times FY17 earnings. We believe that it should continue to remain a part of portfolio on few counts. The return on capital (ROC) has showed tremendous improvement from lower levels to around 54 per cent.
 
 The return on equity (ROE) too is at a very decent level at 50 per cent-odd. If you look at the cash convergence cycle, the company is sitting on decent cash at the current juncture. In addition, the cost optimisation efforts that the company is probably taking to margin expansion, I am not of the opinion that the margins would stay at 14-14.5 per cent.
 
 The numbers have been aided by too many factors in the June quarter results. So, low raw material, freight and fuel costs have probably propped up margins. But decent margin expansion has to happen with the cost optimisation plan and premiumisation story — the cookie market — that will still play out. So, in my opinion, investors who have bought the stock at lower levels should continue holding on to it for 10 years though valuations at the current juncture do not warrant a fresh buy at the current level."

Mitesh Thacker: So on the market, you have probably defined the range. The broader range is still about 8,050-8,100 on the upside to about 7,700. Today morning, I talked about the possibility of bounce back happening given the fact that Nifty was on the hourly closing charts, closer to about 7,700-7,690 which was the earlier swing low. The Bank Nifty was at important weekly pivot levels of around 16,200. The bounceback has started. I was expecting it to be choppy bounce back but this appears to be slightly stronger than what my initial expectation was.
 
 You might see a subdued move in the coming one or two days around 7,850 but, overall the next level on the upside should be around 7,925 to about 7,950. With some choppiness in the next two-three sessions or four sessions we might be trading around 7,950-odd levels."

ET Now: What are your thoughts on real estate sector?  N Jayakumar: Everything is a function of the price at which it is trading and real estate has come off quite dramatically. Most of these stocks are quoting very close to what is the equivalent of book. Three months ago there was no off take in the same real-estate. To a large extent that has changed and things are happening at least in metros. In places like Mumbai, South Delhi and Gurgaon there is a fair amount of activity happening which has allowed the real-estate companies to monetise some of their assets.  So, as companies like DLF and Unitech continues to monetise their land banks and keep reducing their debt then there will be a scenario where some of these companies regardless of the external environment will find a base at current levels and could surprise on the upside as liquidity and interest rates ease off in April-May.  ET Now: Would banks be a good bet to put your money in?  N Jayakumar: Banks are the first space that get affected by interest rates. Evaluations and the bond yields are indicating that somewhere along the line the markets are sensing a cut in interest rates and that might be a force cut in interest rates but it will need to have an impact that brings in further rate cuts.  We are far far aggressively placed in terms of interest rates right now which is only hurting growth. Somewhere along the line the RBI will have to cut rates and the banks therefore will bounce-off their lows pretty aggressively indicating further rate cuts. My own sense is that the downside is limited but there could be upsides evolving even from here. Private sectors banks like Yes Bank given their lower propensity to have NPAs will actually be much bigger beneficiaries than the public sector banks.

  Naik currently holds the position of Chairman and MD at the group, a major player in engineering, manufacturing, construction and a host of other businesses including technology and financial services.
  
  The L&T's board of directors has decided to bifurcate the roles of Chairman and Managing Director in a major top management rejig, which would become effective from April 1.
  
  As per the new structure, Venkataraman would assume the position of Chief Executive Officer and MD, while Naik would assume the post of Executive Chairman.
  
  Krishnamurthi Venkataramanan is currently Whole-time Director and President (Hydrocarbon) and had joined L&T as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in 1969. He was elevated to L&T Board in the year 1995.

  While Venkataramanan would be responsible for the businesses of L&T, Naik would focus on completing the portfolio restructuring, institutionalising the IC (Independent Company) structure, mentoring and developing the leadership team and future leaders, the group said.
  
  Naik, a towering corporate leader of the country, had joined L&T as a Junior Engineer in 1965 and rapidly rose to senior positions -- moving from General Manager to Managing Director and CEO, culminating in his appointment as Chairman in December 2003.
  
  L&T said it has undertaken an exercise, named 'Lakshya', to simplify its portfolio and has created 10 independent companies and seven subsidiaries in order to bring focus, autonomy and accountability. It had also engaged services of global strategy firms for the same.
  
  However, changes in the economic environment has led to L&T undertaking a mid-term review of strategic plan, which is now under finalisation, it said in a statement after today's board meeting.
  
  ""In line with the vision of the company to become an Indian Multinational as also looking at the current global competitive environment, it needs to develop leaders who will manage the company, going forward,"" it added.
  
  Accordingly, the board decided that there was a need for continuity and requested Naik to continue for a period of five years as Executive Chairman of the Group.
  
  ""I am honoured with the responsibility that the board has placed on me. I am also happy that A M Naik's guidance will continue to be available,"" Venkataraman said.

ET Now: We may have hit a fresh high on the Nifty, but somehow market internals do not inspire too much of confidence. Your view?
 
 
Mayuresh Joshi: In view of what has transpired over the past few weeks and months, and given the exuberance that we have seen in the market, our take is that the markets have done more or less enough from a short- to medium-term perspective.
 
 In the post-budget speech, the exchequer was very clear in terms of policy implementation when he said that it will take at least a quarter or more to frame policies and implement them. So, keeping this in mind, if the markets are assuming that a lot of policy action will happen over the next few months, they would be wrong because it is unlikely to happen.
 
 Secondly, the inherent risk that the markets face is the monsoons. The next two months will be critical as to how the monsoons pan out. In case there is some shortage in terms of the overall spread of rains across the country, you might have your inflationary pressures peaking out.
 
 Thirdly, a lot will depend on how the global scenario plays out. Also crucial is what the FED does over the next two to three months. These are something that world markets are watching out for.
 
 So, if one considers all these factors, one would see that the only thing that is left for the markets from short- to medium-term perspective is the corporate earnings. Corporate earnings are going to be a little bit subdued for this quarter and for two-three quarters to come. You are not going to see an exponential rise both in top line and bottom line for most companies.
 
 There would hardly be any exponential growth and even if there is, it would be very stock-specific.
 
 Markets will trade in a range. Even in terms of valuations from an FY15 perspective, we are trading at a fair valuation. So, our take is that the Nifty will find it very difficult to breach the 7900-mark. It might possibly stay in a range of 7250-7900 over the next two to three months."

ET Now: Unfortunately it is wobbly market scenario. Otherwise, we would have seen positive banking reaction maybe? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: What the SEBI has announced is positive for the banking sector. Even the conversion from debt to equity, because the apex body has tinkered with the pricing formula, is quote positive for the sector. We have seen the infamous case of Kingfisher where banks had to finally convert their debt into equity. But, the price they got was meaningless as the ruling market price was significantly lower. It was based on the earlier formula. 

 So, this will give banks tremendous leeway in getting prices which should be more realistic. 

 Now, as we have also realised that the domestic stock market especially from midcaps is very narrow, therefore, taking the six-month average price tends to be misleading at times. 

 But one thing has to be keep in mind that banks cannot hold more than 30 per cent in any company at present. Hence, that needs to be changed. Banks must be given maximum leeway to stakes in in companies and change the managements. 

 Changing managements is critical especially in times when asset quality is such a huge issue and when there are many cases in which managements really have siphoned out money. They do not really deserve to be managing the businesses. Therefore, it is critical that banks get an appropriate price when they convert their debt into equity and they are able to remove existing managements to get new persons on board. It would thus raise some hopes of preserving the asset quality of the underlying loan. 

 ET Now: You may get assets at equity valuations; you may even get it at an attractive price, but that will not change the complexion of the business. A bad asset is a bad asset; the way a bad asset could be revived is that you need to restructure the whole process and you need to really infuse some cash flows. This new formula does not take care of the revival plan. Am I right? 

 

 Hemindra Hazari: True, but that problem can be fixed only by improvement in macro-economy. I really do not, I am not at all optimistic that especially after this Budget that we are going to see any significant revival. Having said that, what is critical is that if banks hold a significant chunk of equity, they can leverage that position to remove the existing management. It is because in a lot of cases, it is the management which remain responsible the poor asset quality. 

 Either they have taken commercial decisions, which were not all viable or they have siphoned out huge amounts of cash from the projects. 

 A lot of the infrastructure projects are highly inflate the cost and banks anyway have to take a hit. Therefore, it is better that they take a hit and remove the management and replace a more stable, confident and reputable management than to have the existing management still in place. Then you are just throwing good money after bad."

 ""We are yet to conclude on the final issuance deal,"" M S Raghavan, chairman and managing director, IDBI Bank, told ET, confirming the move. The bank may do away with the issuance if it doesn’t get the right pricing. ""We have already received bids,"" the CMD added. 

 The interest rate is apparently set at 8.74%, but the bank chairman has not yet approved it. SBI Capital Market is the sole arranger of the issuance, three people familiar with the matter said. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is likely to be the largest investor in the issuance. 

 Ratings agency Crisil has assigned an AA+/Stable rating to the bond issuance. 

 The central provident fund body receives interest payment in a wide range of about Rs 5,000-8,000 crore on Special Deposit Scheme, launched by the government in July 1975, on the first day of every calendar year. 

 Earlier, in September last year, IDBI Bank mopped up Rs 1,000 crore by issuing infrastructure bonds. The coupon or interest rate was at 9.5% with similar maturity. This time, the bank would be better-off with cheaper rates as the benchmark 10-year government bond yield is now hovering 64-68 basis points lower compared to September. 

 About a month ago, country’s third-largest private sector lender, Axis Bank, collectedRs 5,705 crore by selling infrastructure bonds offering 8.85% rate. Those were rated as triple-A by CRISIL & ICRA. India’s largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank, too sold infra bonds for about Rs 3,900 crore in early September. Last year, RBI facilitated long-term lending in infrastructure and affordable or low cost housing."

  In his long and chequered career as a politician and administrator, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is unlikely to have faced a more daunting task than finalising this Budget. The competing pressures on him were intense. Fiscal deficit was way over the numbers projected in last Budget. Inflation, which had cooled in the early months of 2012, was again raising its head. Investment and consequently growth had slowed down to about 7%. Clearly, what was needed was a budget that attempted a fiscal course correction while giving an impetus to growth - itself an onerous task.

  Complicating the scenario further were the setbacks in the recent assembly elections and growing dissonance between the Congress and its allies on various policies. This meant that the political room for big bang reforms was clearly limited. Given these constraints, the finance minister has managed to perform a minor miracle. He has admirably balanced the various pulls and pressures and yet delivered a budget for growth by maintaining consumption, reviving investment, boosting capital markets and widening the tax net. 
  
  The FM is looking at capping the fiscal deficit at 5.1% for FY13. This seems realistic. His positive steps include putting FRBM implementation back on the agenda, capping the subsidy at 2% of the GDP, with the promise of reducing it to 1.7%. Also, if the government is able to deliver on the FM's promise to direct cash transfers using the UID mechanism, it would help plug leakages. All the moves on the infrastructure sector - from doubling the amount that can be raised through tax-free infrastructure bonds to 60,000 to customs duty relief for import of fuels like coal - could restart the much-needed investments in this sector. 
  
  The proposals on the capital markets side - the cut in Securities Transaction Tax, incentives under the Rajiv Gandhi equity scheme for first-time investors, and making electronic format mandatory for 10% of IPOs worth over 10 crore - are again small but directionally important steps. The raising of service tax rate to 12% was a bit of surprise, but perhaps unavoidable given the need to raise resources. But the move to a negative list will go a long way towards simplifying the process. His proposals on avoidance of tax evasion are very significant and could have long-term positive implications for the economy. 
  
  Admittedly, there were no 'big bang', headline grabbing reforms in the Budget. But the FM has done enough to rekindle growth and, more importantly, he has done it in an understated, credible manner that is unlikely to raise any political hackles and thus has a greater chance of success."

The company that’s being valued at around $150 million, will look to sell up to 40 per cent stake. 

 “The company is in talks with global PE funds to raise money. Currently, the due diligence is on,” said a person involved in the deal. Kiran Bhupatiraju, chief executive officer of Laila Nutraceuticals, did not respond to emailed queries and calls on his mobile. 

 Laila Nutraceuticals is part of the Laila Group with business interests across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, ayurvedic products, sugar, paper, finance, hospitality, real estate and education. It manufactures and exports herbal extracts that are key ingredients for the dietary and nutritional supplements. 

 The firm is largely dependent on three key herbal extracts -boswellia, garcinia and gymnema - deriving over 95 per cent of its revenues from these products. Founded in 2005 by Dr G Ganga Raju, son of Gokaraju Ranga Raju, the former chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Party in Andhra Pradesh, Laila Nutra had revenues of around Rs 80 crore in FY 2014. The company is being valued at around ten times its sales at around $150 million, or Rs 900 crore. 

 “The company will sell around 40 per cent stake to private equity funds. It is also open to a strategic partnership. However, the strategic interest of multinationals in Indian nutra makers is low at this point of time,” a senior PE fund manager said. Laila Nutra has its manufacturing facility in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, and supplies these ingredients to its overseas clients such as US-based PL Thomas Inc and Interhealth Nutraceuticals Inc."

Negotiations are on between leading industry body India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), the state’s nodal agency for industrial development, for allotment of land to the trade. IBJA, consisting of 1,100 members, is proposing to shift either lock stock and barrel from the crowded Zaveri Bazaar to the city of Panvel, close to the proposed new international airport, or two nearby locations.  	The discussions began after IBJA approached chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who, in turn, asked MIDC to consider allotment of land around Panvel. “We have requested for around 500 acres to be allotted in Panvel, and will take a call based on the amount of land which can be earmarked for setting up a jewellery park, knowledge centre and accompanying facilities,” said Ketan Shroff, spokesperson, IBJA.  	Bhushan Gagrani, CEO, MIDC, told ET that Pavel may be short of land. “The association has approached us a couple of times. It’s a good idea but we don’t have 500 acres available in Panvel. Therefore, we have suggested two alternatives to them (IBJA) – Roha Mangaon where we are currently acquiring land, and Khopoli.”  	Currently, scores of jewellery manufacturers, gold refiners and bullion traders, operate out of the highly congested market at Zaveri Bazaar, where an estimated 40% of India’s gold trade takes place each year. “It’s highly inconvenient in terms of logistics, security, well-being of workers and ease of doing business. This has made it imperative for us to consider a new location,” added Shroff.  	At Khopoli, MIDC has notified the site for acquisition and setting up of an industrial zone. However, it has not started the land acquisition process as yet. Apart from these locations, the association has also suggested a separate site, also in Khopoli, to MIDC for land allotment.  	“We are currently considering all three locations. If the association is fine with Roha Mangaon site, we can allot the land in the next six months; other places may take longer. And, this will be allotted to them at compensation as per our norms,” Gagrani added.  	Zaveri Bazar is the country’s oldest jewellery market. The oldest outlet, Narandas Manordas, is over 200 years old. It also houses showrooms of reputed jewellers like TBZ The Original, Dwarkadas Chandumal, UTZ, etc.  	Until six-seven years ago Zaveri Bazaar accounted for 65% of the country’s bullion trade. But traders moved to Ahmedabad, India’s bullion capital, when the Maharashtra state government imposed stamp duty of 0.1% on gold and silver in addition to an octroi of 0.1% on gold and 2% on silver, according to Shroff. Ahmedabad imposes neither octroi nor stamp duty.  	Making Panvel a possible hub will do away with octroi and help the Mumbai Metropolitan region to reclaim the status of bullion capital."
Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear. Do you agree?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/warren-buffett-once-said-that-gold-is-a-way-of-going-long-on-fear-do-you-agree/articleshow/48260855.cms,m.economictimes.com,Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear. Do you agree?,"By Sahil Kapoor
 
 The world market was awash with a swarm of gold bugs after the financial crisis of 2008. Gold bugs are advocates of investments in Gold as a safe haven and a guard against financial Armageddon, hyperinflation, currency collapses and geopolitical troubles.
 
 A few years ago, gold bugs argued the precious metal was a can't-miss investment given the ultra-loose monetary policies around the world and the prospect of higher inflation.
 
 However, you can't find many gold bugs as the metal prices have taken a big tumble. The cumulative returns since 2010 for gold HAS almost BEEN nil compared to a return of 70 per cent by Dow Jones Industrial Average and 57 per cent by BSE S&P Sensex.
 
 The current outlook on gold is reflected in this quote by the legendary investor Warren Buffett.
 
 ""Gold is a way of going long on fear, and it has been a pretty good way of going long on fear from time to time. But, you really have to hope people become more afraid in a year or two years than they are now. And if they become more afraid, you make money, if they become less afraid, you lose money, but the gold itself doesn't produce anything.""
 
 One of the principal arguments in favour of Gold at the turn of the decade was the impending hyperinflation which would follow the massive money printing done across the world. This world economy is struggling with continued threat of deflation in Eurozone, anemic growth in Japan, the US and most of the commodity producers, causing benign inflation scenario.
 
 The steep decline in oil prices has added to this fall in inflation and has reduced inflation expectations further. Gold has historically performed fairly well in period of excessive inflation. The period of 2001 to 2008 saw gold multiply about three times, largely led by inflationary outlook and a weakening US Dollar.
 
 Post the financial crisis of 2008, Gold bugs advocated in favour of the ""catastrophe metal"" as a hedge against the then probable collapse of the US Dollar as a reserve currency. The adoption of Euro as a secondary reserve currency gained prominence and supported the gold prices further.
 
 The emergence of Chinese central bank as a buyer of gold to prop up its gold reserves created further demand for the metal amid the sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone in 2011 to 2012. As we stand today, the dynamics supporting the gold price have changed. They changed a few years ago when as a directional bet, we expected gold prices to soften to $1,000.
 
 Hyperinflation, safe-haven and a reserve currency - all these arguments seems to have taken a back seat for now. We expect these factors to continue to weigh on gold prices. A strong dollar and bearishness across commodities are what's really driving gold prices.
 
 
Gold losing safe-haven appeal:
 
 Despite all the global economic uncertainty, ""Gold's safe heaven thesis"" is not really playing out. Gold prices have remained relatively muted in response to the Greek debt crisis, which is an indication that markets have priced in the risk of sovereign default. Over the years, Gold has proved itself to be a safe-haven. However, that appeal has always been short-lived and dependent on the long-term effect of each risk-aversion episode.
 
 
Dollar Strengthening: 
 
 US Dollar has strengthened, largely led by a deep devaluating of Euro, JPY and GBP. This is a product of fresh credit easing introduced by Eurozne, Abenomics in Japan and continued easing in the UK. Many commodity-producing currencies have declined along with oil prices, giving a further fillip to US Dollar.
 
 Gold is priced in US Dollar and has an inverted correlation to it. The effect can be seen on gold prices. US Dollar Index (a measure of the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies) has appreciated 35 per cent since 2011 and in the same time period, Gold prices have declined more than 50 per cent from their peak of $1900.
 
 
Largest Gold Short Position in the COT Report's History:
 
 Speculators are holding the smallest net-bullish bet on gold since the US government data begins in 2006. Latest COT Report shows speculative gold shorts rose to just under 99,000 contracts - the largest level in the report's history. Additionally, the percentage of speculative shorts rose above 45 per cent, which is another COT report record.
 
 
Chinese appetite for gold mellowing down:
 
 The central People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced last week that bullion holdings rose to 1,658 tonnes as of the end of June, from 1,054 tonnes in April 2009. Despite the tonnage increase, Gold now accounts for 1.65 per cent of China's total foreign exchange reserves, against 1.8 per cent in June 2009. The number was much less than the perception of China holding more than 3,000 tonnes, which shows Chinese appetite for Gold is mellowing down.
 
 
ETF Selling: 
 
 ETF holdings have dropped considerably from their 2012 record high of 2,900 tonnes - roughly falling by a third. Gold ETFs worldwide today hold approximately 1,730 tonnes of gold. Sentiment toward Gold is now ""excessively negative"" and we see potential for the yellow metal to recover only once higher US interest rates are priced into markets.
 
 The breakout to the downside of the trading range suggests a fresh leg-down in prices is coming, and that this week's low of $1,085 in gold is not likely to hold. The next longer-term downside price target for gold is a major psychological support at $1,000. At domestic front, similar 8-10 per cent downside could be seen and we could see Gold prices bottoming out around Rs 23,000/10 gm in India.

"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/a-25-fall-in-crude-is-like-a-10-billion-stimulus-for-indian-economy-say-experts-top-stock-bets/articleshow/45121185.cms,m.economictimes.com,"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets","NEW DELHI: India imports around 80 per cent of its crude oil needs, and a fall in the prices of the commodity provides the much needed relief for the country's deficits as the same brings down the import bill.

Analysts say that a $25 fall in crude is like a notional $10 billion stimulus for the Indian economy.

""Falling crude oil prices led to the implementation of the alignment of diesel prices to market rates. This enabled the government to ease subsidy burden. The money saved can now be channeled to some efficient economic projects,"" says Soumyadip Raha, Research Executive - Oil & Gas at Microsec Capital Ltd.

""The government is now mulling over the idea of bringing some of the benefits of lower oil prices to the government exchequer by way of hiking duties,"" he adds.

Further, Raha says that falling crude prices result in better realisations for oil & gas firms as it increases the income of the government from taxes.

Brent crude has seen a sharp fall in 2014 so far, down nearly 30 per cent, on the back of strengthening dollar that suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities.

Brent crude has come down sharply to below $81 a barel in a matter of just five months from around $115 recorded in mid-June. This has already reduced the country's import bill significantly.

India's oil import bill for the last financial year stood at $150 billion.

India's net imports of crude amounts to about a billion barrels a year, and with every dollar decrease in oil prices the bill slips by Rs 4,000 crore, as per media reports.

""The fall in prices (of crude oil) will also lead to lowering of inflation and support higher growth. In turn, lower inflation, improvement in fiscal and current account balances will result in higher GDP growth,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.

""Yes, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the economy as it creates three-way effect on the economy. A fall in crude oil prices results in a drop in crude oil import bills, and thus the total current account deficit is reduced. This strengthens the currency also,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that a drop in crude prices will reduce government's subsidy burden as well as prices of petroleum products in the country would be lowered leading to ease in inflation.

Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors, is of the view that we are going to benefit in a big way with the fall in crude. As someone else was suggesting, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the Indian economy, he adds.

Slowing global demand, especially from the European countries and China, is one of the reasons for this massive decline in the prices of crude, say experts.

The slide in oil had a significant impact on inflation as consumer price inflation has cooled off to its lowest level ever, at 6.46 per cent in September. It has even created room for the Reserve Bank to ease interest rates sooner than expected.


	 


""The fall in oil prices has also provided a commendable stability to the rupee despite a rally in dollar index, thus attracting more inflows into the economy. Overall, the outlook for economic growth has improved,"" says Sugandha Sachdeva, AVP & Incharge - Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Securities Ltd.

As per another estimate, Sachdeva is of the view that a $10 decline in brent implies country's annual import bill falls by around $17 billion.

""Prices are expected to find a strong floor around $80 a barrel and may even retreat towards $88. Having said that, any breach of $80 per barrel would accelerate the fall and lead to a drift towards $75,"" she adds.

Top bets in the oil & Gas space:

Vivek Gupta,CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited

Investors should go long in OMCs like BPCL, HPCL, IOC we also seen have seen decent long build up (rise in open interest & rise in stock price) in these stocks. Our Top Pick is IOC, which is forming a good consolidation on weekly chart; overall trend of stock is up, investors can further enter long around 380 for the target of 440 & 460 in near term.

Nandan Chakraborty, MD-Institutional Equity Research, Axis Capital

The first thing to do when oil prices dip is to buy interest rate sensitives, and not the ones which depend on oil. It is pretty straightforward because if you look at oil marketing companies, as long as LPG and kerosene remain subsidized, they would not have too much of a slack in terms of increase in their profits.

Krishna Kumar Karwa, MD & CFO, Emkay Global Financial Services

As far as the oil marketing and refining companies are concerned, they are the prime beneficiaries of the diesel deregulation. So, we continue to be bullish on HPCL and BPCL.

From a longer-term perspective, I believe that the government is very clear about its policies as far as oil exploration is concerned. These companies should be a key beneficiary of that. They should also benefit from an increase in gas prices. So all in all, I think that these companies should give you very good returns in times to come.

Rahul Singh, Head of Research, Standard Chartered Securities

In the PSU & oil marketing companies, we are positive on Coal India as well and somewhere down the line even ONGC should benefit from lowering of subsidies may be in FY16, although clarity on that is still to emerge. So while PSUs as an asset class have run up and some of them have doubled-tripled, there is still some juice left in some of these companies. But you cannot just generalize.

Bottom-up stock-picking will become more and more important even within the PSUs. So you will have to differentiate much more between the oil marketing companies versus upstream versus GAIL and so on.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: What is your current market view?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Markets will remain range bound in the short-term. They are waiting for an earnings trigger because we saw a significant downgrade in the last quarter. As we get into this first quarter, the trend does not seem to change because the exit rate in the last quarter was very weak, especially on the top line growth but we are pretty confident that you should see a recovery in growth in the second half.
 
 We have seen some early signs of government spending picking up in the first month of this fiscal year. That is going to be the key driver. Government spending this year is going to be key in terms of kick starting demand and we see an impact of that probably in the second half coming through. After the correction, we have seen valuations turning out to be reasonable and any further correction because of global developments could be a good time to increase and add investments into equities.
 
 
ET Now: Yesterday, we saw Tech Mahindra come out and say that the next quarter is not going to be as great. Now, this is something that we have seen played out even in the last quarter when it was almost a blanket profit warning signal from most IT majors. This time too do you sense that this could be more of a sectoral trend rather than just a company specific one? Would the IT sector better avoided for now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: There were cross currency movements in the last quarter, which impacted the dollar growth for most companies. That impact will not be so severe in this quarter because we see some mean reversion over there but in case of the specific company, which you mentioned, I do not think it is an issue across the sector. It is probably the telecom space, where it has a larger footprint, which will result in some slowdown. However, on a broader scale, things are not that bad. In terms of guidance, Cognizant has shown an improvement.
 
 
ET Now: So stick to large cap IT because Infosys, TCS, are sounding reasonably confident for FY16, but what about smaller companies such as KPIT or MindTree?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The IT industry is going through a transition phase where compared to earlier times and material contracts, they are getting more into digitalisation and companies able to do that transition into the digital world are the companies, which will be able to get such an increment because that is where this trend is headed and that is where the incremental orders are.
 
 
ET Now: If indeed the government is going to spend in the first two quarters of the current half of the current fiscal, would the markets start discounting?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The government spending essentially would be in areas like infrastructure which will be in say roads, railways and agriculture etc. These are the areas where you will see not only the central government but the state government because there is a lot of allocation to the state governments this year in the budget and how the state spend also would be important.
 
 So, as we see order flows coming in especially in the road sector, that would lead to some indication. At least it might not reflect into traction down the line because this month is a monsoon month. Activities levels will be a bit low but slowly that money would start to trickle down, get in the hands of various people, consumers. Urban consumption Will start to pick up slowly.
 
 
ET Now: So when you say consumption, considering it is such a large umbrella, what are people going to consume more? More pizzas? Are they going to buy more shoes, more branded clothes or is it going to be cars and other such things?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Currently, what we are seeing is a transition. That is why overall growth is not looking that great. As that inflexion point happens and we are seeing some early signs of that, obviously the demand would be more on the discretionary side. Consumer staples is where the growth is still going to be bit sedate but as your job creation happens, as disposable income increases, as interest rates go down a bit, we do not expect much but at least another 50 bps. We should see demand for all these consumer discretionary products to pick up.
 
 
ET Now: Why do you think demand will pick up, why are you bullish on urban consumption?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: It is not just interest rates which are going to make a big difference. Obviously, interest rates coming down will mean that your EMIs on mortgages will come down. That will mean some amount of savings, which you can spend but more importantly it is going to be demand in terms of job creation. Secondly, because of lower inflation, your real wages are much stronger than what it was earlier so that will slowly lead to pick-up in consumption. We are not expecting any big pick-up but at the margin these are the trends, which we are observing.
 
 
ET Now: Do you sense a renewed vigour in Indian pharma, which is largely exposed to the United States? I am looking at your holding and you do not have too many pharma names. Have I got the holdings right or you genuinely do not have pharma name?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: No, we are neutral on pharma. We have got some of the leading top large cap pharma companies in this portfolio. The pharma companies have had a very good run. Lately, we have seen some kind of product approval delays in a few companies and some correction. The valuations of Indian pharma story continues to look great. They appear good from medium to long term perspective.
 
 The valuations in some of the companies had really gone up very high and there were some near term concerns in a few names. However, the broader long term trajectory in terms of growth in the Indian companies in the US generic space and lot of the companies are also now clearly getting into complex generics, which is slightly higher. So, we think that the growth in this sector should be around 15 per cent to 20 per cent, which is pretty good so we are not negative, we are neutral on that sector.
 
 
ET Now: So you expect the market to be range bound for the next few odd months, what could snap out of this range and what is the biggest risk for India right now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Clearly, monsoon was something, which we were looking at. It has come in pretty good at least for the month of June. One has to see how the onset is in the next few months or so. On the reform side, we have the next monsoon session beginning and expect some development regarding GST. We do not expect much to happen on the Land Acquisition Bill but GST is something, which we would like to get implemented in the next fiscal year because you require these kind of triggers for the market especially at this point in time when growth is still illusive. So these are some of the factors, which one would look at."

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: Our most awaited reform which could have an impact on Indian economy is GST. Assuming that GST would be in place in next 12-15 months, markets would start buying into those sectors well ahead of time. With this assumption, which are the stocks one should buy?
 
 
Deven Choksey: In general, we believe that the GST roadmap will be spelled out in this particular budget. Whether it would get across the board implemented in all the states at one go remains to be seen. However, even if it is getting implemented, it is a process that wille take about one and a half to two years to fully materialise as far as the books of the companies are concerned from the point of view of bringing down the cost structure. The tax structure which will come down because of the rationalisation through GST should benefit most of the consumption oriented businesses before anybody else. Hence, to a greater extent, the focus should remain under the consumption space. Given the kind of possibility in the economy of growth coming back above 6 per cent in the next 12 to 15 months, we believe that automobile sector would probably lead the show at this point of time. Also, automobile sector could possibly have major benefits because of a likely possibility of the bank rate coming down and if interest rates starts coming down, then it would be a double benefit to many of the auto companies. Typically the commercial vehicle segment which have still not moved up as much as the other vehicles or passenger vehicles like Maruti and other companies, I would think that Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland kind of companies within the auto space should remain in the favourable list given this possibility along with the likes of Bajaj Auto which would also remain quite comfortably placed as far as the growth is concerned. This is also due to the export oriented perspective they have. Hence, within the auto space, we like these three. We believe that the consumption space would largely get favoured with the roll out of GST going forward."

Not that he isn’t keen, but he would rather wait for a few more years.
 
 Mariwala, who stepped down as Marico managing director on Tuesday, said it’s too early to say if his children Rishabh and Rajvi will eventually be at the helm of the company that he started some 40 years ago. “It’s still too early to come to any conclusion and we will wait and watch as to what pans out. You cannot predict everything in life,” he told ET.
 
 As ET reported in its Tuesday edition, Mariwala passed on the day-to-day operations of the company to CEO Saugata Gupta who has been elevated as MD. His son Rishabh, 33, had spent three years developing business at Marico’s beauty salon services arm Kaya Skin Clinic before starting a premium handmade soaps company in 2009. Almost around the same time, Mariwala’s daughter Rajvi, 34, too opted out of Marico — she was a part of its brand-building team — to focus on sociological research.
 
 
 
  Mariwala, 63, said the firm does not intend to deviate from its strategy of a having a professional management to run its operations and expand the breadth of its products and services. He said the move to promote Gupta was a natural process and not a sudden decision. “Saugata will be in complete control, in charge of managing the overall business,” Mariwala said, adding that all key division heads will now report to Gupta.
 
 Over 43 years ago, Mariwala quit the crowded traders lane on Masjid Bunder in Mumbai with an ambition to make his two highly commoditised products — edible and coconut oil — national brands. Today, Parachute and Saffola are among the biggest oil brands in India, and Marico has about 20 brands across 25 markets. That is what Gupta, 45, has got to manage and grow.
 
 Mariwala’s mandate to Gupta is clear — drive top line growth in existing and new value-added products and capitalise the combined international and domestic business to become far more profitable. But the market environment isn’t very favourable. Copra prices are at all-time high, with 76 per cent increase since last year.
 
 Also, Marico has been underperforming the market by posting less than 5 per cent volume growth for Parachute and single-digit growth for Saffola since the last few quarters. The company admits that short-term pressures will always be there and the key challenge in the long term is to move beyond oil and succeed in value-added portfolio. Gupta said the firm is trying to shift portfolios in favour of new categories such as oats, personal care and hair colour that contribute 20 per cent of its total sales.
 
 At the same time, there will be crosspollination between its international and domestic brands that will perhaps help the firm enter adjacent categories. According to analysts, while Marico maintains its market shares, sharp price increases in hair oils could keep volume growth under pressure in the future. “The company seems cognizant of poor returns in its past acquisitions and sub optimal return ratios and is looking at sustaining 30 per cent plus dividend payout,” Amnish Aggarwal, analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, wrote in an investor note."

"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shreejit-mishra-two-others-quit-hul-stock-up/articleshow/8659741.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL; stock up","MUMBAI: Four senior-level executives at Hindustan Unilever have quit over the past few months after spending almost two decades with the country's largest consumer goods company. Among those who have put in their papers are Shreejit Mishra, executive director (Foods), N Rajaram, VP (Haircare & Lakme), Srikanth Srinivasamadhavan, general manager (Media Services) for South Asia, and Jayakumar Krishnaswamy, general manager for Supply Chain Excellence. Mishra was not available for comment, while Srinivasamadhavan declined to speak to ET. HUL neither denied nor confirmed the senior-level departures. 
  
  At 9:55 am, shares of Hindustan Unilever were trading 0.40 per cent up at Rs 304 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  Rajaram joined Bharti Airtel in March as its chief marketing officer, while Krishnaswamy joined Akzo Nobel as Director SCM, late last year after spending over 15 years at HUL in two separate stints.Replying to a detailed questionnaire sent by ET, an HUL spokesperson said, ""The attrition rate in HUL is significantly below industry level, at 5% per annum for the last four years. What we have is natural attrition, which is essential and healthy for all organisations in terms of both talent management and development."" Top officials in the know about these developments said a changing work culture at HUL and increasing job opportunities for HUL managers outside have triggered the exits. 
  
  ""Many of these managers have been in the same role and designation for over three years now. HUL is on top of Polman's list, and his directive that managers will have to spend longer tenures in their existing roles to ensure consistent business strategy, may have also triggered the move. The internal target of around 20% sales growth every quarter is adding to the pressure on HUL managers,"" said another senior HUL official. When Paul Polman took over as Unilever CEO in January 2009, the company was under pressure as customer spend on branded products had slowed down. Polman, the first outsider to head Unilever, injected some aggression into the group - including at its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever - and put in place a performance culture across companies globally, linking rewards to results. 
  
  Brand managers were also asked to report on 30-day schedules, adding to the pressure to perform consistently every quarter. 
  
  The results are now visible at HUL, which has been witnessing 13% volume growth for the fiscal ending March - the highest in over a decade, despite a large base of nearly Rs20,000 crore in sales 
  
  Mishra, who is HUL CEO Nitin Paranjpe's batchmate, is the most high-profile exit. He joined HUL in 1987 as a management trainee and moved up the ladder to become a member of the core management committee. Four years ago Mishra, then VP Activation-Asia AMET, Unilever and based in Singapore, was made Executive Director (Foods). During his tenure, the processed foods division has grown 67%, from Rs 538 crore in 2007 to Rs 900 crore today. 
  
  Watchers say HUL's managers are much sought after in the corporate world. ""It's good to see HUL managers becoming ambitious. The company has always been a good training ground for managers to perform well in other companies across sectors,"" said Kannan Sitaram, operating partner at India Equity Partners, who spent over two decades with Unilever. ""In the last few years, HUL's pyramid was getting narrower at the top, influencing some managers to take up top jobs at other companies""."

 The Pune-based pharma company had filed draft offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the proposed IPO in June last year. 

 The proposed issue comprised of fresh issue of up to Rs 300 crore and an offer for sale of up to 25,13,057 equity share. 

 However, the company through its lead merchant banker IDFC Capital withdrew its offer documents on June 6 this year, as per the latest update available with Sebi. 

 The pharma company intends to utilise the net proceeds for setting up of new manufacturing facilities and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, research and development and general corporate purposes. 

 The company is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a broad range of pharmaceutical products globally. 

 Emcure Pharmaceuticals operates nine manufacturing facilities, eight of which are located in India and one in the US. 

 Prior to Emcure Pharmaceuticals, three firms --Trimax IT Infrastructure and Services, BSCPL Infrastructure and GMR Energy-- had withdrawn their respective public offer plans this year so far."
Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-it-will-be-a-tough-task-for-vishal-sikka-to-revive-infosys-back-to-its-glory/articleshow/36430060.cms,m.economictimes.com,Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,"The mood on bourses appears to be not so encouraging after the announcement of Infosys to appoint Vishal Sikka as CEO and MD. After a firm opening on Thursday, the stock came under selling pressure. It had lost 2% on NSE by 11am. The big worry for investors is whether it’s too late for Sikka to be at the helm and whether the current issues facing the erstwhile industry bellwether can be surmountable.
 
 Sikka has to wade through following major challenges and that would be easier said than done:
 
 1. 
The growth conundrum- Infosys has added a significant number of new clients, 238 to be precise at the gross level, in the four quarters to March 2014. This is higher compared to its peers. However, this did not culminate into higher revenue growth. Infy’s sequential revenue growth lagged that of its close peers including TCS and Cognizant and a smaller peer, HCL Technologies.
 
 2. 
The changing nature of deliverables- The global IT outsourcing industry has shifted from traditional wage arbitrage to multi-year, deals that are capable of transforming the business. This includes remote infrastructure management (RIM) services. At present, Infosys derives over 7% revenue from RIM compared with peers who earn 12-34% revenue from this segment. RIM has shown a higher growth over the past few years compared with the traditional services. This makes it necessary for Sikka to focus on improving Infy’s exposure to this segment.
 
 3. 
Higher employee attrition rate- Infosys has not been able to tame the rate of attrition in the past few quarters. Attrition was 18.7% during the March 2014 quarter compared with 16.3% a year ago. This is also higher than 11.3% for TCS and 16.9% for HCL Tech. Talent management and retention will be a tough task for Sikka.
 
 4. 
Sliding profitability- Infosys has long been following what it coined as quality growth in the form of industry-best margin profile. But this has changed over the past few quarters as the company reported a sharp fall in operating margin. In the March’14 quarter, it reported operating margin was 25.5% compared with over 30% in the March’10 quarter. During the said period, both TCS and HCL Tech improved their profitability. Sikka will have to strike a fine balance between growth and profitability as he scouts to bring the company back to its glory days."
Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/association-of-mutual-funds-in-india-warns-members-to-stay-away-from-suspicious-ready-forward-certificate-of-deposits/articleshow/32817251.cms,m.economictimes.com,Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,"The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has asked its members to desist from suspicious ready forward deals in certificate of deposits (CDs). In an e-mail to fund houses a few days ago, AMFI chief executive HN Sinor also warned that the market regulator wants to end this practice as it leads to asset management companies risking investor money. 

 “Also, desist from entering into undesirable trades/transactions, which are not in conformity with regulation,” Sinor said in the e-mail, reviewed by ET. Sinor asked the fund houses to furnish daily transaction date to CRISIL/ICRA, the rating companies that provide daily CD quotes. ET had on March 12 reported that some asset management companies were doing CD trades at a pre-fixed rate, which were perceived to be violating norms while increasing the risk for investors. The financial mechanism, known as “parking” or “river crossing” or “holding period return”, is generally seen towards the end of a financial year and involves four parties — the issuer of CDs, the ultimate subscribers, cashrich entities such as banks and companies that provide parking space, and the intermediaries. 

 The latest AMFI communiqué came after the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) sought clarification on such practices in an e-mail dated March 21. “Some fund houses complained to Sebi to stop recurrence of this unhealthy practice. The regulator spoke to AMFI on this and later, official e-mails were exchanged,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. 

 In its reply to Sebi, AMFI assured of maintaining “best practices” among fund houses. It wrote, “The parking phenomenon……. leads to funds buying assets at yields higher than the then prevailing yields in April.” 

 Mutual funds, the biggest buyers of CDs, face redemption pressure in their liquid funds from lenders that need money to expand credit. At this point, some intermediaries or brokers connect some cash-rich entities, be it banks or corporates, which extend funding support to MFs by temporarily buying the three-month CDs at typically 9.60% to 9.90% range at the fag end of March quarter from issuers."
Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/infibeam-mulls-filing-draft-red-herring-prospectus-by-december-as-it-gears-up-for-its-ipo-next-year/articleshow/44953953.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year,"NEW DELHI: Ahmedabad-based e-commerce company Infibeam plans to file its draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by December as it seeks to make its market debut next fiscal amid increased inflows into the country's consumer internet businesses.
 
 Infibeam, which owns and operates e-commerce venture Infibeam.com and B2B e-commerce platform BuildABazaar, is looking to raise about Rs 500 crore -Rs 1,000 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), while targeting a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore-Rs 4,000 crore.
 
 “Investor interest continues to peak when it comes to strong internet businesses in India that have shown consistent growth, and I think we are well poised to capture that,“ said Vishal Mehta, founder and chief executive of Infibeam.
 
 Infibeam, which sees about 80,000 transactions across its platforms, has targeted a revenue of Rs 500 crore and gross merchandise sales of about Rs 2,000 crore for the current fiscal.
 
 The IPO, expected in 2015, will make Infibeam the first Indian e-commerce company to go public in the country. HomeShop18, which has al so announced plans to go public, has filed documents to list on the US exchanges.
 
 Infibeam, which has appointed Axis Bank to be the lead book runner for the IPO, is looking to list on both the National Stock exchange and the BSE.
 
 The developments come at a time when consumer internet companies, while receiving increasing funding from private equity and strategic investors, have also begun to receive significant attention from the country's retail investors.
 
 “There will be an appetite and there is no reason why we won't see the same trends as in the US or China,“ said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital, a leading investment bank.
 
 Local business listings website JustDial's public market flotation in May last year saw a strong response from investors, with the company raising about Rs 950 crore in the process. The company's market capitalisation on Monday stood at Rs 10,200 crore.
 
 Matrimonial venture BharatMatrimony.com has also signalled its intention of going public by the next financial year, which could see other consumer internet companies follow suit.
 
 Infibeam, which is yet to raise any foreign institutional capital, may also look to sell a portion of its equity through private placements ahead of its planned IPO. Mehta, however, did not disclose details, stating that the company was still in discussions.
 
 Foreign investors have purchased a net $34.99 billion of stocks and debt until October 21 this year. In 2013, India's stock market received a net foreign fund inflow of $20.10 billion while the debt market saw an outflow of $7.97 billion, stock exchange data showed.
 
 “The Indian market is looking at the consumer internet space, but while it may accept the business model, it may not accept companies that continue to make losses. That is the gap which has to be addressed,“ said Garg."

The Nifty ended the week at 6066; almost flat compared to the previous week’s close. 
  
  FIIs bought Rs 1,893 crore worth of shares in cash while local institutions sold worth Rs 1,388 crore India VIX, which measures the immediate expected volatility, and saw a weekly high of 23.9 and closed at 21.61. 
  
  We saw highest build-up of Calls at 6200 followed by 6300 (for the October and November series). We expect this activity to continue as the market gathers a bullish undertone. Highest Put build-up was seen at 6000 strike. PCR-OI for the October expiry is at 1.18, while that for the November expiry stood at 1.24. Higher PCR for November is purely a function of hedging activity; with majority of Put build-up seen at strikes below 5900. It should not be construed as a bearish signal.
  
  Overseas growth data to be watched for will be US home sales, employment data and advance estimates for US 3Q-GDP. Back home, we will have WPI data being reported on the expiry day. Technically, the Nifty has not given any signs of topping out and is still holding the momentum. Fresh round of selling could be seen only if the Nifty hits a new bottom of 5930 and trades below this level. 
  
  Till then, we continue to maintain ‘buy’ on every decline. Fresh round of buying could be seen, if the Nifty holds above 6115, then the next target could be 6220-6330. The market will continue to consolidate in the range of (5900-6200) with extreme volatility on the cards, as metal majors JSPL, Sterlite and SAIL report 
  earning this week. 
  
  Strong support is seen at 6010 levels. We observed very high Call IVs at ATM strikes for Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Hindalco and ICICI Bank hinting these scrips may see a run-up from their current levels.

Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/euro/usd-looking-at-support-between-1-3815-30/articleshow/34377220.cms,m.economictimes.com,Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30,"Euro Summary  	Euro-dollar closed in NY Monday at $1.3853 after rate had corrected away from highs of $1.3879 to $1.3840 into the European close before it drifted higher through the US afternoon. Rate touched an early low of $1.3849 in Asia before picking up fresh demand that lifted it to $1.3865 ahead of the European open. This recovery/buoyant tone continued into Europe as rate pushed on to $1.3872, holding back at $1.3865 into the release of Saxony CPI data. The m/m release showing a fall of 0.1% prompted sales to $1.3860 but with the y/y coming in at 1.3% (up from previous 0.9%) saw buyers quickly emerge into the dip to take it up to retest Monday's high at $1.3879. Rate eased away from this level, with the correction given an added shove from release of soft Italian retail sales, ECB M3 data and soft German states' CPI. Rate found support at $1.3855 (61.8% $1.3840-79) before bouncing back to $1.3870 as Germany NRW CPI came in above expectations. The euro was holding firm in late morning trade, with continued talk of Russian interest to buy euros in dips. Resistance seen at $1.3879/85, ahead of $1.3900. Support $1.3850/40.  	EUR/USD  	Still failing to break significantly through the 76.4% Fibo retracement at $1.3876, maybe been a couple of points higher, at this stage. Now looking to support from between $1.3815-30 to hold this decline, or risk a much deeper fall and the possibilty of a double top around $1.3878. While intact, we can see another attempt higher, $1.3904-$1.3977 the immediate target zone above. Below $1.3815 and the Apr 22 low at $1.3786 becomes key.  	Sterling Summary  	Cable closed in NY Monday at $1.6810 after rate had posted multi year highs at $1.6858 on the back of demand prompted by confirmation from US Pfizer of its interest to buy UK AstraZeneka. However, talk of an Astra price tag rebuttal, along with Pfizer stating that funds for such a takeover are mainly held offshore, weighed back on sterling, which along with release of stronger than forecast US house data pressed cable to session lows of $1.6801. Demand between $1.6805/1.6795 cushioned the move. Early Asian trade was contained within a tight $1.6807/10 range (trade very subdued due to the Tokyo holiday; start of Golden Week) before it lifted to $1.6817, settling between $1.6813/15 into Europe. Reported euro-sterling stops above stg0.8250 targeted in opening Europe trade, the rate pushing to stg0.8252 before reversing to stg0.82255 as sterling picked up decent demand on positioning ahead of UK GDP release. Positive press comments by BOE Carney provided an added boost as cable traded to $1.6846. However, data came in just under forecast and sterling was sold to $1.6792/stg0.8259 but buyers quickly emerged to take cable back to $1.6820, the cross to stg0.8245.  	GBP/USD  	Rally through $1.6841 has been curtailed by the swing target at $1.6857 so far. Subsequent decline has to hold above $1.6790-95 support, in order to retain current upside momentum. Loss would put recent $1.6779-$1.6765 lows under pressure, beneath which $1.6713-$1.6662 come back into the picture. While near term supports hold, then we can challenge $1.6857 again, with $1.6881-$1.6918 still the target zone above.  	Yen Summary  	Dollar-yen witnessed a very subdued Asian session with trade tied to a narrow Y102.47-54 range. The cross opening around Y141.97 made a show through Y142.00 on the back of triggered stops in euro-aussie, before stalling ahead of tech resistance at Y142.16 (61.8% of Y143.45-140.08). Traders await the BOJ policy meeting and press conference tomorrow for further market direction. Demand via the crosses improved appetite in early Europe, lifting the pairs to Y102.55/Y142.25 and a break of tight overnight ranges. Euro-yen triggered stops on the move before momentum stalled and drifted lower. Release of German Saxony CPI which came in lower at -0.1% m/m initially slipped to Y142.12, before a stronger y/y reading countered the move, spiking to Y142.27. Second wave demand with added support from a strong sterling-yen move took the cross on to extended highs of Y142.45. Mixed CPI readings from Brandenburg, Hesse and Bavaria followed and with added weight from soft eurozone M3 data, pared light gains. A stronger North Rhine CPI looked to re-test intraday highs, however the move lacked conviction to settle in narrow range trade. Dollar-yen tracked early moves and spiked to Y102.67, the rate holds firm with offers seen into Y102.70.  	USD/YEN  	The move through Y102.40 on Monday should now give us another look at Y102.72. Above and we head for Y103.15-Y103.45, an area which includes two projected targets, as well as Fibo retracements. May well be tough to break above here at this stage. Support in the meantime has moved up to Y102.20-30 and a loss here on the day would be a disappointment and suggest the recovery was struggling again. This would bring Y101.88-98 back as key support below."

S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sp-upgrade-may-drive-fii-debt-flow/articleshow/43764215.cms,m.economictimes.com,S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,"MUMBAI: The foreign fund flows into Indian debt instruments may turn into a tide with investors gaining confidence after Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook for India to stable from negative in line with other international rating companies Moody’s and Fitch. 

 Standard & Poor’s move last week, owing to the new stable government at the Centre that the company will prove conducive to reforms, came at a time when foreign holding limits in government bonds are nearly exhausted and overseas investors are turning to corporate debt, bringing borrowing costs of companies lower even as the Reserve Bank of India wants to keep rates high. 

 “The change in S&P’s outlook will only strengthen global investors’ favourable long-term outlook towards India,” said Neville Fernandes, head of debt capital markets at Citi India. “The confluence of low interest rates, tight credit spreads, abundant liquidity and favourable investor outlook for India presents a very attractive financing opportunity for Indian corporates.” 

 India’s rating of BBB-minus is the lowest in investment grade, below which is the ‘junk’ category where investors are normally wary of investing. 

 Till August this year, foreign institutional investors or FIIs have net invested Rs 1,02,473 crore in Indian debt securities compared with net sales of Rs 50,848 crore in 2013. 

 FIIs are fast exhausting their limits or caps set for investing in Indian debt securities. They have already utilised nearly 97% of the $25 billion earmarked for government securities while they have exhausted 66.50% of the limit for long-term investments in government bonds for more than five years. 

 Overseas investors have of late turned to corporate debt segment capped at $51 billion. So far, they have exhausted about 46% compared with 35% on June 2. 

 Since government limits for regular FIIs and foreign portfolio investors or FPIs are practically filled, enquiries are increasingly coming in for corporate debt investments, said Ananth Narayan, regional head of financial markets at South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. 

 According to dealers, some of the actively traded corporate securities include top-rated Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, Food Corporation of India, HDFC Ltd, L&T and UltraTech. 

 The yield spread between government and corporate bonds has contracted 15-20 basis points in the past few months, suggesting fall in corporate bond yields. Yield and prices move in opposite direction. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. 

 “In September alone, so far we have seen high inflows of about $1.5 billion, which could be a record high. In terms of pricing, corporate issuers would be benefited due to higher demand,” said Lakshmi Iyer, senior vice president and head of fixed income and products at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management. 

 Acting as custodians, two multinational banks have in the past few weeks added 15-20 institutional clients each from Europe for investing in India. Large institutional investors like Pimpco, BlackRock, Warburg Pincus, Fidelity and Fairfax are expected to step up their bets in Indian debt securities, dealers said. Last month, foreign fund Franklin Templeton had bought bonds worth about Rs 16,000 crore in the largest single-day purchase of Indian government securities. 

 “The ratings revision encapsulates the positive sentiment on India, but more importantly takes us a step closer to a game-changing rating upgrade for India. We believe large institutional investors will continue to invest,” said Amit Bordia, head of corporate Finance at Deutsche Bank India. 

 Some foreign central banks and long-term pension and insurance funds from Southeast Asian and European countries are also expected to ramp up their investments with lot sizes of Rs 200-500 crore each."

Deven Choksey: Yes, at times, it would surprise us for sure. Not every company would probably fit into the M&A kind of a story that we are talking about. Even I am sure that Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy probably must have done a good amount of due diligence before buying into the Ranbaxy. So to a greater extent, applying the same yardstick to every company would be wrong but yes, the market has a mind of its own. Probably they have some different way of looking at Wockhardt. I am not totally sure as to what are the kind of stories that they are playing around with. But yes, where exactly the growth comes from in this company is an intriguing question.
 
 So we would not get into this particular company. We would rather stay with the likes of Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy, the likes of Cipla, the likes of Glenmark, or Lupin in the pharma space."

US stock futures edge higher before jobs data,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/futures-edge-higher-as-tech-stocks-rebound-private-jobs-data-on-tap/articleshow/93907513.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Futures edge higher as tech stocks rebound, private jobs data on tap","US stock index futures edged higher on Wednesday as technology and growth stocks snapped back, while investors waited for private payrolls data to gauge how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to tame decades-high inflation.

 The three main indexes are set for sharp monthly declines, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 4% after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's blunt and hawkish remarks on Friday about keeping monetary policy tight ""for some time"" quashed hopes of more modest rate hikes.

 Meanwhile, mixed economic data signaling easing price pressures and strong labor market has weighed on investors' mind heading into September, which is a typically a weak month for stock market returns.

 The benchmark S&P 500 is up 9.6% from its mid-June lows but remains in bear market after plummeting earlier this year.

 ADP National Employment report, due at 08:15 am ET, is expected to show private payrolls likely increased by 288,000 in August. It will be followed by a reading on Chicago PMI for August after market open.

 On Tuesday, data showed U.S. job openings rose to 11.239 million in July, pushing stocks to close lower for a third straight session.

 It also comes ahead of the more comprehensive and closely watched jobs data for August on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 300,000 jobs last month after rising by 528,000 in July.

 Any signs of a cooling job market would be welcomed by markets as that could ease the pressure on the Fed to stick to outsized rate hikes.

 Heavyweight technology and growth stocks such as Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc and Nvidia Corp, which took a beating in last few days due to a surge in Treasury yields on rate hike prospects, rose between 0.6% and 0.8% in premarket trading.

 At 07:07 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 25 points, or 0.08%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.26%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 83.75 points, or 0.68%.

United Spirits could have the best risk-reward ratio,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/united-spirits-could-have-the-best-risk-reward-ratio/articleshow/34068378.cms,m.economictimes.com,United Spirits could have the best risk-reward ratio,"The timing of Diageo’s open offer at Rs3,030 per share of United Spirits, just a little before the Whyte & Mackay (W&M) sale and prior to the national elections, is interesting, given the low premium on offer and the fact it would allow certainty of control to Diageo. Investors should consider accumulating the stock at the current level, given some of the triggers for the company, going ahead.
 
 The positives that could play out in the next few quarters include cash from Whyte and Mackay sale, new CEO and the premium story. USL could have the best risk-reward ratio for the next few months. The upside can be significant, and the downside limited, irrespective of the election outcome (due to the open offer which will begin in June), analysts say. “Diageo is our top pick due to several catalysts in the stock,” said Manoj Menon, consumer analyst, Deustche Equities.
 
 
  
Whyte & Mackay Impact 
 
 The company is expected to complete the W&M asset sale in the next few months after concerns on competition raised by the UK Office of Fair Trade. The company has hired Standard Chartered, Rothschild and Rabo Bank as advisors and it’s understood that the bids have already come in. Although the bid prices are not known, analysts value W&M at £350-700 million (Rs3,500-7,000 crore).
 
 “If the value realised for W&M is around £700 million, this will unlock value for United Spirits, wipe out its entire debt and increase its long-term return ratio profile,” said Arnab Mitra of Credit Suisse in a recent report. He added that W&M value unlocking could be a major trigger for the USL stock and at a valuation of £650 million, the EPS upside could be almost 45.2 per cent for FY15. At the end of September 2013, its net debt stood at Rs7,100 crore with over two-thirds of the company’s operating profit going towards debt servicing.
 
 
Lowest Open Offer Premium
 
 The offer is about 18.5 per cent higher than the floor price (26-week average price) of USL, one of the lowest among open offers in two years. This is despite Diageo seeking control of United Spirits. Last year, HUL had launched open offer at 23 per cent premium and GSK Consumer Healthcare at 37.2 per cent to the floor price. Both the stocks are now trading above their offer prices.
 
 “We are advising clients to buy the stock as, among large-caps, it has the best risk-reward ratio,” said a sales official of a leading multinational brokerage on condition of anonymity. “There is a possibility that Diageo has kept a buffer and may increase the open offer price after talking to institutional investors, who may not tender at such a low premium.”
 
 
Diageo on USL
 
 In November 2012, when Diageo acquired USL at Rs1,440, the investment was expected to be economic profit positive in six years. Despite more than doubling the price (Rs3,030 now), Diageo claims the investment would be economic profit positive in seven years. “There has been a significant rerating of the Indian consumer goods story, given the promise of renewed economic buoyancy and other macro positives,” said Deirdre Mahlan, CFO, Diageo, in a recent interview.
 
 This reflects an upward revision in earnings estimates by Diageo for USL. “We do not expect a full acceptance for the offer and believe longer term investors will wait for the premiumisation theme to play out in USL,” said Harit Kapoor of IDFC."

They will be listed in the Singapore Exchange. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 

 These bonds of five-and-a-half year maturities come with a coupon rate of about 4.50%. The bank has arrived at such pricing after adding a 280-basis point spread over and above the 5-year US Treasury, which is currently trading in the range of 1.70-1.74%. The effective yield has come around 4.54%. ""The entire fund will be used for offshore operations,"" a senior bank official told ET, adding that rates offered were a win-win for both the investors and the bank. Institutional investors across Asia, Europe and the Middle-East have subscribed to the issuance. 

 UBI has sold bonds through their Hong Kong branch. These offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase were the investment bankers for the issue building. The securities are rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors while S&P, another global rating company, has assigned a BBB- to the issuance. 

 Almost two weeks ago, the State Bank of India (SBI) had raised a total of $1.25 billion by selling bonds in two maturities: five and ten years. The five-year bond was priced at a spread or gap of 205 bps over the 5-year US treasury, which would be equivalent to a yield of 3.62%. This is significantly below than the Union Bank of India's spread at 280 bps. ""Being the largest Indian lender SBI commands premium among investors, who always consider the bank as quasi-government bond. The rest state-owned banks do not enjoy the same,"" said an investment banker."

 Sudip Bandyopadhyay: Well, it is going to continue much longer, in fact our view is that rubber prices are not going to start going up in calendar year 2015 also, probably calendar year 2016 will see rubber prices going up so there is still long way to go. 

 In the entire tyre pack, people have not looked at Balkrishna Industries in a very serious manner. This is one counter in the tyre space which one needs to look at current levels, it is an excellent company exporting to 120 countries. India being their manufacturing base, definitely in terms of cost advantage, it has huge advantage over global majors.

Pressure on the company’s operating margins was due to key raw material costs as a percentage of net sales which rose to nearly 440 basis points YoY to 79.8% in the third quarter of FY10. The company’s key inputs include steel and allied products, and according to various estimates, domestic steel prices are higher by nearly 11% YoY in the third quarter, as domestic steel prices are quoting at a premium of 8-10% compared with the landed cost of imported steel. The company’s net profit was Rs 22.2 crore for the third quarter, a rise of 44.2% YoY, helped by lower interest costs and higher turnover. The quarterly results of Texmaco were declared after the close of trading on Wednesday, but the stock had declined 0.9% to Rs 162.5.

Yes, the stock has been a little quiet before today in the last two three weeks since this rally started gaining force but it is doing a bit of a catch up now and it is also at the high of the day. So this is reasonably promising but it is not at its bull market high. So the longer term trend in this stock is not that well established say auto or some of the other sectors. Question on cement, two specific stocks, UltraTech Cement and Binani Cement, both up close to 6% in today’s trade. Well, to take Binani Cement first, this has crept up really to the, it is the bull market high at about 75. It has come up there once or twice and then reversed. So now what has got to be seen is whether it stabilises above this level. If it does then it is onto a new bull market high which is really an affirmation that it is partaking in the bull market and in a strong uptrend, so that is really what is to be looked for over here. Apollo Hospitals? Apollo Hospitals if you look at the stock, it is for here’s and there’s it has tended to remain in a range. So as far as the long term is concerned of the stock, there is really very little happening here. Short term it makes sporadic moves and today would fall in that category. The very long term range in this stock has been something around 350-700 which it is approaching the top of until there is a breakout because it has not managed to do this since 2003. That is what we got to look for. Wheels India, that is up 20% today, is it looking good for more? This is not really that heavily traded a stock, so when you get a move which after days and months of inactivity takes place, one would not read too much into it but the interest today is definitely there. Today’s volume is perhaps higher than that of the last 8-10 days put together but this would not be the sort of move that I would get interested in this stock because it is a one off situation but somebody holding the stock should certainly hold onto it, it is up at the circuit and it is good payoff if people had been holding onto this stock patiently. From a trading angle, a short term target on MTNL given the momentum? Well, it is only now that there is some interest in this stock. It is first of all in the wrong sector. That sector has been doing very poorly and this stock has been of considerable disinterest to traders, its volumes have dropped but last three or four days, there is some momentum building up. If it is somebody is very speculative about it maybe, take a position, see what happens a day or two ahead but there are better options around. Ideas that you think look interesting, give us at least two of them for tomorrow morning? Well, continuation of the closing today, so Sesa Goa which I just mentioned earlier, that has had a good close and Tata Motors is always a very safe bet in a rally. It tends to be among the leading index stocks, so these two should be able to maintain where they have finished. I would not go with fertiliser yet because they were not doing very much before today. So I would wait for them to correct first and then look at buying them. You would avoid fertilisers, that has been established. You still want to monitor the momentum that we have seen in today’s session but aside of that, the other strong midcap movers whether it was the auto component space, the auto majors, some sporadic moves coming in on BOC India and the likes, what would be your pick, what is one trading position that you would carry forward into tomorrow?The problem at auto ancillaries is that they do not trade very heavily. So if you are looking for stocks which have say a futures contracts or so attached, you do not get too many auto components but if you look at the stocks as such, they have been doing pretty well right from the tyre industry to axels or any other auto components. So the auto sector is obviously giving them a boost, so anybody holding any of these stocks, they have good long term ideas and definitely need to be in there. The other sector not mentioned at all today but as budget approaches and since fertiliser is making the moves could be the rail stocks because already the volumes have picked up in all the Kalindee’s, (15:23) and Texmaco’s, so they could also be once again in the running before the budget."

ET Now: The buying that we have seen in IT and pharma and PSUs today, do you think that can continue into Monday morning? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: I think that can continue even till the 9th or 10th of this month because a lot of the rally that we have seen in cyclicals is kind of a hope-fuelled rally. And while it is nice to be hopeful, you would be much better off trying to enter stocks which have a) corrected and b) will benefit from a stable government. The tech stocks are going to benefit because they turn cyclically. So, a move up is probably round the corner. All the froth has gone, most people have gotten out of their tech stocks so this is a good time cyclically. People will get into the space because if something goes wrong the CNX IT will very quickly get back towards 10,000, and then these stocks will hedge your positions if you are planning to go long into the elections. So that way PSUs will do well. People are continuously building positions in PSUs regardless of the verdict. In any case, they are so dead and beaten up that they can only move higher. So probably the next week could be good for them."

  Sudarshan Sukhani: The rally that we saw in large cap IT stocks is probably over which is the reason why I have added TCS to my short selling list after a long time. We are going to see lower levels in all of them. Infosys has already begun its correction, Wipro has done it. 
  
  So the 2 stocks left are TCS and HCL Tech. Both will correct. The chances are that their correction will be relatively shallow but for TCS we can look at 900 to 950 and that would be an attractive level to enter it."

 At the end of today’s trade, the market-capitalisation (m-cap) of TCS soared to Rs 5,09,523.91 crore, the highest for the company since its listing in 2004. Shares of the outsourcing giant ended the day at Rs 2,601.30, up 2.45% on the BSE. In intra-day trade, it rose by 2.9% to Rs 2,612.95. 

 In dollar terms, TCS’ market valuation rose to $84 billion.TCS, the first Indian company to achieve the feat, had earlier crossed Rs 5 lakh crore market-cap in July this year. 

 The IT bellwether is also currently the country’s most valued company in terms of market valuation. TCS is followed by state-run ONGC whose m-cap stood at Rs 3,74,730.47 crore, Reliance Industries (Rs 3,33,400.02 crore), ITC (Rs 2,78,020.71 crore) and Coal India (Rs2,37,495.30 crore).

"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tcs-signals-slowdown-brokerages-remain-unfazed-retain-rating/articleshow/32290558.cms,m.economictimes.com,"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating","NEW DELHI: After Infosys, India’s largest software company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has signalled that the March quarter is typically slower for them than the Dec quarter due to seasonality and fewer days.

Hence, Q4FY14’s QoQ revenue growth could be lower than the October–December quarter (Q3) at 3%, but “this should not be any indication of slowdown in demand,” clarified the management.

The management, however, has reiterated that the FY15 revenue growth would be higher than FY14, led by improvement in discretionary spending in the US and market penetration in Europe.

Key takeaways from TCS analysts meet highlighted the fact that near-term commentary remains soft, but the management retains its positive discretionary spend-led FY15 outlook.

TCS expects Q4 to be softer than Q3 in CC terms, growth to be led by Europe and Latam, and India to decline. But the management is confident of a strong outlook for FY15 over FY14. Margins, however, are likely to drop 40-50bps QoQ due to investments.

However, analysts at top brokerage firms are of the view that revenue growth will be seasonally low in the upcoming quarter, but overall trends look positive and currency will play a small role in Q4. But investors who want to remain invested in the IT space for long term should look at accumulating the stock on dips.

“Margin impact of currency fluctuations and reinvestments would likely be 40-50bps in Q4FY14. We adjust our FY14-15 estimates as per management commentary, but maintain our rating on TCS,” Barclays said in a note.

Barclays has incorporated the management commentary in their forecasts and consequently lowered their FY15-16 EPS estimates by 1.0 per cent. The global investment bank has revised its target price to Rs2,275 and maintains ‘equal-weight’ rating on the stock.

Earlier in the month of March, Bangalore-based Infosys spooked the street after chief executive SD Shibulal told investors the company was expecting to end the current fiscal year only near the lower end of its 11.5-12% guidance.

Reacting to the news, most brokerage firms reduced their respective target prices for Infosys. BofA-ML, Deutsche Bank and Barclays reduced their respective 12-months target prices by Rs 200-300.

But analysts are more confident this time on TCS and see more of a temporary phase for the company as management still remains confident about global operations.

Analysts expect the IT major to outperform industry on revenue growth as management commentary on demand trends for FY2015 continued to be reassuring, led by a favorable demand environment and market share gains.

“We expect TCS to outperform industry on revenue growth due to its superior market reach and excellent execution capabilities. We expect TCS to grow its USD revenues at a CAGR of 16.5% over FY2013-15 and EPS at a CAGR of 25% during this period,” Angel Broking said in a report.

	 
TCS has executed well over the past many quarters and currently trades at 18.5x FY2015E EPS. The Mumbai-based brokerage firm believes that TCS’ premium multiples are well deserved given consistency in performance and leadership in growth/profitability. They maintain their ‘buy’ rating on the stock.

Here are the views of five global brokerages firms on TCS post analysts’ meet:

Barclays:

The global investment bank has incorporated management commentary in their forecasts and consequently revised their FY15-16 EPS estimates downwards by 1.0 per cent. Their numbers imply 4.5% US$ revenue CQGR for FY15E compared to 3.6% witnessed in FY14.

Barclays’ revised the price target is Rs 2,275 (based on 18x weighted average of FY15-16E EPS) and they continue to maintain ‘equal-weight’ (EW) rating as they find valuations fair.

Goldman Sachs:

Goldman Sachs has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2122.55. It says EBIT margins should remain in a stable band, though we may see some impact (40-50 bp) as TCS continues to make investments in the business through penetrating newer geographies, service lines. Hence, it has maintained that margins may stabilize in the 27%-28% band in the long term.

Citigroup:

While Q4 is likely impacted by seasonality, management commentary on demand trends for FY15 continued to be reassuring. Expectations/valuations in TCS are the highest in the sector, and there could be limited upside from these levels. For investors who are looking for some upside in IT sector, Citi prefers Wipro and HCLT among the Tier 1 stocks.

Their target price of Rs 2,350 is based on 20x Mar'15E EPS. Citi estimates TCS' earnings will grow at a 23% CAGR over FY13-16E, and believed the stock should trade closer to the higher end of its historical five-year trading range of 7-24x 12-month forward earnings.

Morgan Stanley:

MS remains overweight on the stock. The global investment bank believes that management commentary about a weaker 4Q will keep expectations low going into the results. Overall, Morgan Stanley believes muted expectations for 4Q are unlikely to lead to any material change in the Street’s FY15 earnings expectations. The stock is trading at a premium to its peers (~19x FY15e and ~16x FY16e EPS), that could be sustained over the coming quarters.

Religare Institutional Research:

TCS valuations, though at a premium to the sector, have moderated to 19x FY15E earnings. Predictable growth and the ability to navigate margins will support TCS’s premium over the sector.

An improvement in demand outlook and continued execution would be the key stock triggers. Religare maintains ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,450."
Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/tax-free-bonds-regain-demand-in-the-secondary-market/articleshow/48059129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,"MUMBAI: Tax-free bonds which have been languishing for more than six months due to lack of investor interest in the secondary market, are in demand again.
 
 High networth individuals and some institutional investors are willing to invest in the instrument via the secondary market as they expect new tax-free series to offer lower rates on the back of expected fall in the benchmark yield and the odds for more rate cuts by the central bank have increased.
 
 “For HNIs wanting larger allocation, secondary tax frees will make sense, if there is some supply,” said Himanshu Bhagat, managing partner at IIFL Wealth. “Here (secondary market), we can then see some limited yield correction.”
 
 During 2013-14, Rs 49,200 crore of tax-free bonds were sold with rates offered in the range of 8.01-8.76% for 10-20 year maturities. Two years earlier, bonds worth Rs 48,000 crore were offered at a wide range of 6.82-8.30%.
 
 A week ago, the government mandated seven top-rated state-run companies to raise Rs 40,000 crore this financial year. Issuers are expected to start bond sales from this month-end in a phased manner. Sizable issues are expected in October-March, the period people plan their tax saving and have funds to invest.
 
 “HNIs and some cash-rich corporates are now keen to take bets on tax-free bonds via the secondary market as yields may fall five to 10 basis points,” said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income at Edelweiss Financial Services. “The new series could offer lower rates following the expected fall in the benchmark yield.”
 
 The benchmark yield on Monday rose six basis points to 7.86%, pushing prices down as an additional Rs 10,000 crore bond supply by the Reserve Bank of India added to the supply-side this week.
 
 But, good rains along with macro parameters will leave more rooms for the central bank for rate cuts this financial year. Lower interest rate in the market would pull bond yields lower. Also, the latest Greece debt deal has put a lid on speculation that the debt-ridden country would exit the European Union and prompt a market turmoil.
 
 On an average, the benchmark yield is expected to fall to the 7.50% level in the next three to six months, dealers said.
 
 Going by the incumbent benchmark yield as of now, an investor can earn as high as 7.25-7.5% by investing in the new series of tax-free bonds with 10-15-20 year maturities. Tax-free bonds will be priced after adding 45-80 basis points (varies on investor class and security rating) to the yield of similar-maturity sovereign bonds.
 
 “If the existing secondary market tax-free bond yields are near the 7.10-7.25% levels, it makes sense for HNIs (investing above Rs 10 lakh) to invest a portion of their money"", said Rupesh Bhansali, head-distribution at GEPL Capital.
 
 In the secondary market, 10-year triple-A rated tax-free bonds are yielding 7.15-7.25%. On 15-year paper, the yield is 7.25%.
 
 Yield on the National Highway Authorities of India’s 15-year tax-free bond has fallen five basis points in the past three weeks. Since the beginning of the financial year, this paper has seen transactions 15 times until July 9."
Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/tata-steel-q4-show-beats-estimates/articleshow/35138490.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel reported a consolidated profit of Rs 1,035.8 crore, beating market expectations, helped by higher sales volumes and better realisations in Europe and India. 

 Analysts, on an average, were expecting Tata Steel to report consolidated net profit of Rs 970.9 crore on sales of Rs 40,791.9 crore, according to a poll conducted by Bloomberg. The company reported a loss of Rs 6,529 crore during the same period last year, hurt by impairment charges. Sales rose 22% to Rs 42,428 crore from the same quarter last year. 

 Sales volumes grew to 7.6 million tonnes (MT) compared with 6.6 MT during the same quarter last year. Tata Steel board has recommended a dividend of Rs 10 a share for FY14. 

 Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortization (EBITDA) was Rs 4,917 crore from Rs 4,368 crore during same quarter last year. EBITDA per tonne rose in India and Europe but fell in South-East Asia. 

 Tata Steel Europe CEO Karl-Ulrich Köhler said that the Europe business is focussing on operating costs and will look to reduce costs through more internal measures. He acknowledged that the company continued to see pressure on margins. 

 “Europe is suffering from overcapacity, which means pricing power is limited. Since there was a decrease in raw material prices, the benefit of which will come with a lag effect, customers asked for lower prices,” Köhler said. Global iron-ore prices have fallen sharply in the last three months, putting downward pressure on steel prices. 

 Tata Steel Europe, known as Corus before the $13-billion buyout in 2007, accounts for more than half of Tata Steel’s total consolidated revenue. 

 The company, which has been severely hit by recession and overcapacity, has remained operationally positive for five straight quarters, driven by several restructuring measures and a slight uptick in demand in Europe. The company indicated at more restructuring in the coming year. 

 ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, showed ‘cautious optimism’ about the recovery in the continent about the business outlook for the rest of 2014, when it reported quarterly results last week. 

 Tata Steel is India’s largest private sector steelmaker by revenue. It has a production capacity of about 10 MT per annum in Jamshedpur and about 18 MT in Europe. The company is increasing steelmaking capacity in Kaliganagar, Odisha. The project will add about 3 MT in the first phase of expansion. 

 Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director, said the Kaliganagar will be commissioned this year. The company has already spent Rs 16,350 crore this year. However, on the impending interim order by the Supreme Court on illegal mining in Odisha, the company remained non-committal. “Each company has to be treated on merit. We are operating with all clearances. But as all good companies we have a plan B in place,” said Chatterjee. 

 He refused to elaborate on the plan. Gross debt rose to Rs 81,000 crore as on March 31, 2014 from Rs 76,500 crore three months back. On refinancing of debt, Chatterjee said: “it will happen, when it has to happen. We’ll take a call when it’s due.” Shares of the company jumped to a 22-month high and closed up 6% at Rs 452.15 per share on BSE on Wednesday."

Maran makes open offer for SpiceJet,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/maran-makes-open-offer-for-spicejet/articleshow/6048600.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maran makes open offer for SpiceJet,"NEW DELHI: Sun TV Network promoter Kalanithi Maran has offered to buy 20% stake in SpiceJet from the public at Rs 57.76 each. If successful, it will give him majority stake, allowing him to go ahead with plans of rebranding the no frills airline.
  
  This follows a deal where Mr Maran in his individual capacity agreed to acquire 37.7% stake in Delhi-based budget airline from the promoter of the firm besides financial investor Wilbur Ross for around Rs 739 crore. He will have to shell out Rs 479 crore to buy the additional 20% stake.
  
  The open offer price is at 4.7% premium on the Monday’s closing price of Rs 55.15. The domestic airline, which now has permission to fly overseas to Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal, witnessed hectic trading of shares which soared over 6% in early morning trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It touched an intra-day high of Rs 59.55, only to close 1.61% lower from the last traded price on Friday. The open offer has been made by Kal Airways, a private firm promoted by Mr Maran and his wife Kaveri. It will open on August 6 and close on August 25.

  What is the call on SpiceJet?
   
  It has been into a very strong downtrend for quite a while and slammed down into supports near the 41-42 area. We did see a very large volume upside move from the lows today. So it is very clear that there are interests in buyers somewhere in the 40 to 42 region and that would remain a decent level of support to buy in. 
  
  I would not really chase this stock but looking at the very strong decline that we have had, certain bit of an upward bounce is not unrealistic and since the stock has been into a lower top lower bottom formation from somewhere in let’s say 97 levels to 42 levels, a decent pullback is on the cards. Stock is a decent bet, your risk levels are very close by. So with a target of about 65-67, this is a buy."

 Even after excluding the one-off income from sale and leaseback of aircraft and engine warranty claims, the Chennai-based airline has reported profits, mainly due to higher passenger traffic. Moreover, the performance follows five consecutive quarters of losses. 

 SpiceJet recorded a net profit of Rs 54.6 crore for the June quarter, compared with a net loss of Rs 71 crore a year ago, on the back of a 26% growth in passenger traffic. 

 The airline also witnessed a significant improvement in revenue per passenger, to Rs 4,068 from Rs 3,283 a year ago, which helped its net sales grow 51% to Rs 1,406 crore in Q1. Going ahead, it would be vital for SpiceJet to boost regional connectivity."

ET Now: NBFCs what do you do you speak to any company a small cap company like TFCI which in the investor conference yesterday guided very well. You were speaking to Capital First and the management comes on air tomorrow to speak about their future and they are sounding positive as well. Similarly for an SKS Micro. So almost every NBFC is talking very positively for the next couple of years at least. Do you have any preferences in this space do you like them at all? 

 
Dipan Mehta: I have mentioned on this channel as well that we have a preference for SKS Micro and within the NBFC space, there is a great deal of potential but investors are better off trying to venture into NBFCs which are specialised like SKS Micro into Microfinance and then there is Bajaj Finance and other company which we have an interest in.
 
 The same with Capital First which is more into SME funding. So wherever there are specialised NBFCs ,those will benefit because of the underlying volume growth that they are able to achieve, another segment of the NBFCs which is very interesting and lots of ideas over there would be the housing finance companies starting right from LIC Housing to Repco. 

 So on the whole, we are quite positive on the NBFC sector and they have demonstrated good growth rates, some amount of regulatory overhang also has got discounted with the new RBI norms for NBFCs. We have checked a lot of the companies are not getting affected as much as was thought earlier. So on the whole, it is great going for NBFCs and from shareholder point of view over the next three-four years.

As opposed to this, cement realisation of companies in the rest of the country has been erratic and in most cases, it has fallen.   	After following operational discipline due to overcapacity for a long time, south-based cement companies increased cement prices given the scope of new demand following the creation of two new states -Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is anticipated that there would be an incremental cement demand of 23 million tonnes (MT) which is higher than 20 MT which united Andhra Pradesh had during peak cement cycle.  	As a result, cement prices in south increased by Rs 20-50 per 50 kg bag in the September quarter. In contrast, with the exception of western region -where cement prices jumped in the range of Rs 20-40 per 50 kg bag - cement prices in North, East and Central regions have either declined or remained range bound due to weak demand.  	At present, cement utilisation in the South is in the range of 55-58% as opposed to 80% in the rest of India. As momentum in demand picks up in the region, cement prices are expected to rise in the coming quarters."

They have cut down on their working capital expenditure and on the whole the overall uptick in the economy also seems to benefit companies like Sintex Industries.

The overseas subsidiaries had been hit hard by the economic turmoil over the past 18 months, but have now started looking up. However, following the company’s failed attempt at acquiring Geiger Tech in Germany, which filed for bankruptcy, Sintex is likely to write off its initial investment of E7 million (approx Rs 46 crore) during the current financial year.For the December quarter, the company reported a 3.4% growth in consolidated net sales to Rs 848 crore. However, rising raw material costs impacted its operating margin leading to a situation where its PBDIT is now below the year ago level. The company shaved off close to one-thirds of its interest costs by replacing high cost loans, which helped its pre-tax profit inch up 3.5% to Rs 98.8 crore. Its textiles business grossly underperformed during the quarter with a 6% dip in sales and 67% fall in profits. In comparison, the plastics segment performed well with a double-digit profit growth against the year-ago period. Sintex Industries’ December 2009 quarter financial performance failed to impress investors, as its shares dipped 0.8% to close at Rs 269 on BSE. The scrip, which has underperformed the Sensex during the past year, is now being valued at 12 times its consolidated earnings for the past 12 months.The company reported improving capacity utilisation rates across businesses, which can help boost higher revenues, going forward. With over one-thirds of its annual profits typically generated in the last quarter, the March 2010 quarter numbers could be substantially better. The company is also carrying a war chest of around Rs 800 crore of cash, initially raised to fund an acquisition, which could add an unexpected boost to growth."
"Cost cuts, reworked deals boost Siemens margins",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/cost-cuts-reworked-deals-boost-siemens-margins/articleshow/34415149.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Cost cuts, reworked deals boost Siemens’ margins","Internal controls appear to be paying off for Siemens, the Indian arm of Europe’s largest engineering company, Siemens AG. Its focus on cost controls and better project management is reflected in its financials.
 
 The company’s operating margins in the first half of FY14 improved to 6.5 per cent against the last six-quarter average of 3.7 per cent, though revenue growth slipped by 7 per cent.
 
 Siemens India’s financial year ends in September. In the past few quarters, the firm posted divergent margins, from as low as 1 per cent in the third quarter of FY13 to as high as 13 per cent in the second quarter of FY12.
 
 Analysts believe the main reason for such variance is its high exposure to currency risk.
 
 The company imports most of its raw material. Besides internal controls to boost margins, the company is also re-negotiating with its customers on price.
 
 Post the March earnings, the management stated there’s still significant amount of under-cutting to grab orders, and the difference between the lowest bidder and the next possible one ranges between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
 
 Adding to the woes of capital goods firms are the trade terms, which seem skewed in favour of the buyer, resulting in stretched payment schedules . The company says it will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and ignore lossmaking orders.
 
 The attempt by the firm to focus on profitable volumes has led to a slide in order inflow growth as it stays away from loss-making orders. The order inflow declined by 4 per cent to Rs 4,620 crore in the first half of FY14 against Rs 4,790 crore in the same period last year.
 
 It continues to see a decline in order inflow from infrastructure and energy, which contributed 48 per cent to total revenue in the March quarter. The order backlog stands at Rs 12,900 crore at the end of March 2014.
 
 Despite the stock appreciating by 41 per cent in the last six months, 73 per cent of analysts tracking it, have put a ‘sell’ call on it, influenced by its P/E ratio.
 
 According to Bloomberg, earnings per share (EPS) for the next year is expected at Rs 16.23, which means the stock is currently trading at a P/E of 47.5 times of one-year forward earnings.
 
 Given the headwinds of a demand environment and cut-throat competition, a 47 times of P/E for a stock like Siemens India appears to be quite expensive for investors. On earnings, net profit climbed 185 per cent to Rs 88.29 crore in the March quarter, while revenue declined by 8 per cent to Rs 2,706 crore on a y-o-y basis. The drop in revenue is mainly the result of clients deferring deliveries."

It closed 5% up at Rs. 408.10 on Wednesday after reporting its second consecutive quarter of net profit, after remaining in the red for the previous three.
 
 For the October-December period, the firm posted a net profit of Rs. 22.4 crore against a loss of Rs. 2.9 crore a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to Rs. 139.8 crore.
 
 Instead of cutting back or waiting for the external climate to change, Shreyas increased capacity, while simultaneously reducing cost per tonne of cargo. It sold two old vessels and replaced them with newer, larger and more fuel-efficient ships.
 
 “The strategic and decisive actions by the board resulted in this strong turnaround. Newer vessels and better capacity utilisation on higher cargo from transshipment and domestic market helped,“ said chairman and managing director Ramesh S Ramakrishnan.
 
 Shreyas did not attribute the turnaround to any significant rise in demand, but mostly to its internal change in strategy . It increased capacity utilisation by venturing into non-container cargo, like steel coils. That helped it increase utilisation of empty vessels on return journeys. The company hopes to buy more vessels going forward.
 
 Last year rating agency Crisil had expressed concern about volatility in bunker costs and slow growth of container traffic in India resulting in low utilisation of its fleet. Both these issues have been resolved to a great extent by falling fuel price, more efficient vessels and higher utilization rate.
 
 ""It is not a recent story. The company has been able to consistently improve its earnings in the last three quarters. Even the first quarter for the year would have been profitable without a one-time expense,"" said an analyst, who refused to be named. Shreyas' market cap stands at Rs. 268.83 crore.
 
 Coastal shipping — which commands a significant share of trade in the US, China and Europe — accounts for just 7% of the country's total domestic cargo transport network even as India has a coastline of more than 7,500 km."

  On Bajaj Hindustan, upside seems to be limited. Most of these stocks were showing good momentum but now are broadly range bound between about Rs 60 and Rs 80 on Bajaj Hindustan.

The bank’s London branch has raised the bond issue rated as BBB-. 

 Deutsche Bank was the sole investment banker for the issue, which was priced at 2.83%. The coupon is derived after adding 144 basis points over and above the five-year US treasury yields. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. 

 Praveen Kumar Gupta, DMD and CFO, SBI, has confirmed the matter. “This was a foreign borrowing for lending overseas only. It was through a normal borrowing route,” he told ET. 

 Those offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. With higher demand for Indian papers, the spread or gap, over and above the US treasury yields has contracted. However, US sovereign yields have gone up as prices have fallen with investors expecting US rate hikes sometime in June-July. 

 “We are getting an increased number of queries from institutional investors for Indian top-rated bonds,” said an investment banker engaged in offshore bond sales. 

 Earlier in February, India’s largest private sector company by revenue Reliance Industries raised $750 million by selling 30-year maturity offshore bonds. The yield spread was at 262.5 bps while US treasury yields had dipped to record lows as prices moved up. The final yield came at 4.875%. 

 Nearly two weeks prior to that, the company had mopped up $1 billion through similar bond sales but with 10-year maturity at 4.125%."

Samvat 2071 gets off to a sparkling start,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/samvat-2071-gets-off-to-a-sparkling-start/articleshow/44920429.cms,m.economictimes.com,Samvat 2071 gets off to a sparkling start,"MUMBAI: Samvat 2071 started on a cheerful note for stock investors, with the market ending firm in the 60-minute trading – known as Muhurat – on Thursday, bucking the weak trend in other Asian markets. Mid- and small-cap stocks outperformed their larger peers in the special session, which is held to mark the beginning of the traditional new year.
 
 BSE’s Sensesx rose 63.24 points, or 0.24 per cent, to close at 26850.47. NSE’s Nifty gained 15.55 points, or 0.19 per cent, to close at 8011.45 on Thursday. Among the broadmarket indices, BSE’s mid-cap index gained 1 per cent and the small-cap index rose 1.5 per cent. Financial markets will be shut on Friday on account of Diwali. In commodities futures, turnover in gold and silver rose on the commodity exchange MCX.
 
 Usually, it is the trader community, which participates in the Muhurat trading session. They enter small token trades with an intention to book profits as making money in this hour of trading is considered auspicious. This could be the reason for the activity in mid-caps. But mid- and small-cap shares on the Muhurat trading session may not repeat their recent strong performance in Samvat 2071 as many of them are considered expensively valued after the recent rally. So far in 2014, mid-cap index has gained 44 per cent and small-cap index has gained 63 per cent.
 
 “In Samvat 2071, only quality stocks which are moderately valued will outperform the broader market and investors should not expect much from overvalued mid- & small-cap stocks,” said Nilesh Shah, MD and CEO, Axis Capital.
 
 Samvat 2070, which ended on Wednesday, has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The Sensex has risen over 26 per cent in this period.
 
 Brokers and investors are expecting similar returns this Samvat as the government has embarked on market-friendly measures to bolster the economy. But the road is unlikely to be smooth. Global markets are facing stiff hurdles from the euro zone, where concerns of a recession have resurfaced.
 
 Also, the era of easy global money may be coming to an end soon with the US Fed expected to increase interest rates mid-2015. There are worries that the flood of foreign institutional investor (FIIs) flows, which pushed up stock prices, may ebb once the Fed tightens its monetary policy. Though central banks in Europe and Japan continue to keep interest rates at near-zero levels, investors are not sure how much of that money would flow into emerging markets like India.
 
 For Indian stocks, the next big event will be the Union Budget for the financial year 2015-16. Investors are expecting the government to step on the gas on the reforms process with key state elections out of the way."
Sabero's growth prospects appear attractive,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/saberos-growth-prospects-appear-attractive/articleshow/6030013.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sabero's growth prospects appear attractive,"The crop protection major, Sabero Organics Gujarat (SOGL), has done exceedingly well on the bourses following its improved financial performance. Its stock has more than doubled in a span of one year, way ahead of the benchmark Sensex performance.
  
  SOGL’s profit for the fourth quarter more than tripled to Rs 7.1 crore, despite a 3% dip in the net sales at Rs 96.5 crore. Operating margin saw a 300-bps improvement to 15% as costs of raw material consumed fell 28%. 
  
  The performance of its domestic business improved in FY10. Domestic sales for the whole year grew 40% to Rs 180 crore representing 42% of the total sales of the company as against just 34% last year. In the case of its exports division, the sales also grew in the Americas region while Asia, Europe and Africa reported a drastic fall in sales.
  
  The proportion of debt in SOGL’s capital structure also got reduced during the year on account of a 15% equity dilution over the year and an 88% growth in net profit. Its debt-equity ratio dropped from 1.03 a year ago to 0.71.
  
  With more than 240 product registrations, Sabero operates on a wide network of distributors and agents in 50 countries. The company has its subsidiaries in Argentina, Europe, Australia and Brazil, with Europe and Brazil being the main focus areas to obtain registrations. The company is further expanding its international presence in the geographies of Costa Rica, Venezuela, the Philippines, Guatemala, Cameroon and Argentina. 
  
  The company is currently in the process of setting up an export-oriented plant of technical active ingredients at Dahej in Gujarat with an estimated capacity of 2650 tonnes per annum by December 2010. The capital cost of Rs 55 crore will be financed by a combination of $9-million external commercial borrowings and internal accruals. 
  
  Also, the company plans to increase the capacity of its Chloropyriphos plant by 50% until September 2010. Moreover, it is set to launch two new fungicides and two herbicides in the first half of FY11.
  
  It has announced a final dividend at the rate of Rs 1.20 per share for the year, which works out to a dividend yield of 1.6% at the current market price of Rs 73. This is 5.5 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share. Given the company’s expansion plans, its growth prospects appear attractive for the future."
Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/steep-appreciation-in-rupee-to-lower-oil-subsidies/articleshow/16591247.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,"MUMBAI: A steep appreciation in rupee is likely to help reduce India’s oil subsidies substantially. The rupee-dollar exchange rate recently dropped below the 200 day moving average (DMA), which is regarded as significant by technical analysts.
 
 A report by Emkay’s predicted the trend to continue further till the exchange rate reaches 51.9 — another 1.5% appreciation. This can knock off Rs 25,000 crore of under-recoveries for the petroleum industry in the remaining 6 months of FY13.
 
 Just a few weeks back India was looking at a fuel subsidy bill exceeding Rs 2 lakh crore or 2% of the country’s GDP. The recent increase in diesel prices, cap on LPG cylinders and tax changes is estimated to cut this down by Rs 25000 crore. But the recent rupee appreciation, if sustained, would knock off additional Rs 25000 crore from the under-recovery estimate over next 6 months
 
 The daily under-recovery of petroleum industry was estimated at Rs 498 crore for the second half of September 2012 in spite of the diesel price hike in the first half. This was at an average import price of Rs 6350 per barrel of India’s crude basket.
 
 Since then, the import price of Indian crude basket has fallen to Rs 5700 per barrel thanks to a 6.7% drop in international crude prices and 3.7% appreciation in rupee.
 
 
 
  
 
 Assuming this level remains stable through the remaining 6 months of FY13, the total under-recovery for the whole of FY13 — including Rs 84,000 crore for the first six months of the fiscal till September — would drop below Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
 
 The impact of such a drastic fall in subsidy bill would be improvement in risk profile of the country for foreign investors. This will lead to more forex flows and lead to a further improvement in rupee. Rupee’s appreciation would also make imports cheaper thereby tempering the domestic inflation, which is another economic challenge for the economy."

 Analysts say prospects will look rosier once there is clarity on gas price hike from the new government and the company comes up with plans for effective utilisation of the cash on its balance sheet which is about Rs 86,000 crore. RIL has lined up large-scale capital expenditure plans in retail, telecom, and petrochem which is expected to boost operating profits in coming years.
 
 Shares of RIL have risen only 11.5% this year, underperforming the benchmark index. BSE Sensex has rallied 21.5% over the same period. On Saturday, RIL reported a consolidated net profit of almost $1 billion, up 13.7%, for the first quarter of the current financial year 2015."

  Official figures released on Friday said 2,13,09,532 tonnes of rice have been procured by the various government agencies upto Thursday, with Punjab leading the States. Buys by the state government stood at 86,33,706 tonnes of followed by Chhatisgarh and Andhra Pradesh at 27,82,753 tonne. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh bought 16,57,437 tonnes and 16,54,640 tonnes respectively.
  
  Food Corporation of India (FCI) had procured 21.88 mt of rice in the year-ago period. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) chairman and MD Siraj Hussain had estimated that government rice buys would reach 32 mt in the 2010-11 marketing year starting October this year, beating the target of 31 mt, despite drought in some parts of Bihar and UP. Compared to this, government agencies had procured 31.47 mt of rice in 2009-10 marketing year (October-September). According to the second advance estimates released by the ministry earlier this month, rice output is projected to surge to 94.01 mt this year against 89.13 mt last crop year (july-june). Last year, rice output had declined by over 10 mt due to drought in 2009-10 crop year.

However, its recent acquisitions are expected to drive its growth in the coming quarters. The strong 74% growth in the consolidated revenue did not trickle down to profits since the company did not get support from its asset management and investment banking business segments. 
  
  Its lending business, which drives almost half of its consolidated revenues, saw the interest yields contracting. Coupled with rising interest rates, this led to a 42% fall in the net profit for the segment. Further, its subsidiaries re-ported a combined loss of Rs 87.4 crore. Therefore, the company re-ported a loss of Rs 98.5 crore against a profit of Rs 21.5 crore a year ago on a consolidated basis. However, the company is taking various initiatives to drive business growth. 
  
  Its key global asset management and investment banking divisions have seen a spate of acquisitions . For instance, the global asset management business acquired Northgate Capital and Landmark Partners in 2010. This has given the company access to assets under management of $11.3 billion (Rs 56,000 crore) along with greater capabilities in primary and secondary private equity, venture capital and real estate segment. Its investment banking business acquired three companies in the December quarter. 
  
  Besides providing geographical diversification, these acquisitions would help in reducing the turn around time in the regions . Investment banking business is relationship driven. Once the integration with the target companies completes, the company would be able to fully capitalise on the target’s relationships. This would help the company in generating profits at a fast pace. 
  
  Moreover, the effect of rising interest rates on its lending business would fade away, as almost 62% of its financing book is floating rate in nature. Hence, the increase would be passed on to the borrowers. While the company has invested heavily in its key driving businesses, the future growth depends upon how fast the company finishes the integration with the acquired companies."

  Well the stock is an excellent long term uptrend. It didn't fall very much during the markets correction of the last month or so. 
  
  Today's fall isn't keeping with market conditions. I would not think this fall will last very long either for the market or for REC so even REC could be picked up into a bit of a decline and keep a stop loss about a 1%-2% down from here that should workout reasonably well."

In the past few days, a spurt in rains in western Rajasthan has accelerated pulses sowing in the state, kindling hopes of recovering pulses acreage deficit.
 
 According to the latest sowing data, the total coverage under pulses is 74.48 lakh hectare as against 89.34 lakh hectare last year in the corresponding period.
 
 Out of the overall deficit of 14.86 lakh hectare, Rajasthan alone accounts for 12.6 lakh hectare.
 
 “Rajasthan contributes 45% of the total moong production in the country. If pulses sowing picks up, we can recover the deficit in pulses. Moong, which takes only 2 months for harvesting, can be sown till August 15,” agriculture secretary Ashish Bahuguna told ET.
 
 The pulses area is also likely to replace the acreage targeted for coarse cereals, which is dismally down due to deficient rains in the major coarse grain growing states of Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
 The area under coarse cereal is 140.89 lakh hectare as against 175.14 lakh hectare last year. “Most of these areas will be covered by pulses and fodder crops. Farmers usually divert to going pulses and fodder crops if nothing grows as pulses need less water and the life cycle is short,” said IMD chief LS Rathore.
 
 The government has a programme in place to achieve more than 19 million tonnes of pulse production."

 Both metals had, in fact, outperformed the MSCI World and the MSCI Emerging Index by a huge margin on a yearto-date basis. Gold has returned 9% in 2014 so far, which is one of highest returns on a YTD basis since 1983, while silver gained 11%. 

 The equity index has largely been flat, or 3-4% negative on a YTD basis. The crucial factor that bought the sheen back to metals is the re-emergence of ‘risk on’ trade and investors moving out of equity instruments. In the age of flight to safety, money pulled out of emerging markets on ‘increased country risk’ is being invested back in gold/silver. 
  
 The trades, based on the notion of ‘sell emerging markets and buy metals’ which led to the spread between MSCI Emerging Markets and gold spot, reversed on heightened risk perception from January 23, this year."

  What should one do with Pipavav Shipyard? If you had bought the stock at the Rs 80 levels, would you advise booking out or if you have not got into the stock, would you initiate a long at these levels?
   
  The first part is pretty easy because if you had got in at Rs 80, then you could possibly take some profits off the table but on a two or three week of basis, the stock looks likely to have more upsides from these levels also. Possibly Rs 105-110 are good targets with two or three week kind of horizon for Pipavav Shipyard. You could look to add to quantities if you do not have it. At these levels, you could buy with a stop loss below Rs 85. You could just accumulate this stock at these levels again at Rs 88-90 range. Rs 105-110 is a good target for Pipavav on the upside."

Now with the news out that Ranbaxy will sell the generic drug rights to Torrent Pharma and the drug sale will meet the fair trade norm for the Sun Pharma merger I believe that decks are being cleared for that. What would your view be on Sun Pharma essentially because Ranbaxy is just a derivative of that now? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: By and large, I have been quite positive on the pharma space, especially those which are exporting to the United States of America because along with IT, these two sectors should do much better other than the domestics in this FY15 and FY16 as well. So for me these will be more positive sectors where the visibility is more assured than what we are seeing because on the domestic side, you are seeing more and more uncertainty. There is more and more risk building up. So for me, I would definitely go for the pharma sector and Sun Pharma would be one of those companies."

But since then it has really been quite strong and even now to bottoming out in February after a bit of a correction it has had a slightly sharp correction in April, it has to be said but it is coming back to the levels it has reached this year.

  At 10:53 am, shares of ONGC were trading 0.77 per cent up at Rs 280.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The huge sequential fall in earnings stands in sharp contrast to private sector explorers such as Cairn India, which reported 22% growth in net profit helped by higher prices even though production fell. 
  
  ONGC's share in subsidy at Rs 12,135 crore in the fourth quarter was almost equal to the total of past three quarters. This took the total subsidy toll to Rs 24,892 crore for fiscal 2010-11, more than double than previous year. 
  
  In January-March, although ONGC earned an average oil price of $108.90 per barrel, it ended up with just $38.75 in hand as the government took away the rest. What remained was nearly 25% below the year-ago period causing a 26% fall in net profit. 
  
  State-run fuel retailers sell products such as diesel and cooking gas to end-customers at subsidised rates. The subsidy burden arising from selling the products below market price is shared between retailers, upstream companies, and the government. 
  
  The company reported net profit of Rs 2,791 crore in the last quarter driven by higher profits on natural gas, whose prices were revised in fiscal 2010-11, and increasing share of production from joint ventures. As there is no subsidy burden on production from joint ventures, the 60% incremental volumes helped. 
  
  Although oil prices have jumped more than five times since 2004-05, ONGC's average profit growth has been a mere 6.5% per annum. The average annual growth in its market capitalisation was just about 4.5%. Every year, the government has taken away a chunk of its profits to pay for losses made by oil marketing companies. 
  
  The subsidy sharing mechanism and its value-destructing impact will keep weighing on investor sentiment. The government is expected to divest its stake further in the company in early July. 
  
  This could induce the government to introduce some reforms for a better price. Investors, who are otherwise living off the annual dividend payouts, may look forward to a run-up in prices if the follow-on offer materialises."

 SEA further stated that soybean meal export is at the lowest level as Indian shipment is still outpriced in the international market.

Nilkamal's stock price rises 7 pc,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nilkamals-stock-price-rises-7-pc/articleshow/5418084.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nilkamal's stock price rises 7 pc,"Plastic product maker Nilkamal witnessed a sharp rise of 7% in its stock price on Tuesday. The counter is buzzing following a turnaround in the company’s performance in the past two quarters. The stock has been up over the past one month.The scrip has gained 41% in one month, notwithstanding the sluggishness in the broader market. The benchmark Sensex posted a modest return of 2.7% during the period. Nilkamal’s performance on the bourses stands out taking into account the returns for the three months, six months and one year.For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 64%, and it has more than trebled in six months. The Sensex returns lagged behind in each of these periods. Compared to the year-ago level, its current price of Rs 245 is four times higher. Nilkamal, which grossed Rs 564 crore in the past four quarters in revenue, manufactures injection moulding products, including home furniture. It had posted net losses in the second half of FY09. The trend, however, has reversed since then. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters. This was largely aided by a significant drop in raw material prices due to a relative softening in prices of petrochemical intermediaries, including polyethylene and polypropylene. As a result, input costs as a percentage of sales fell sharply from 71% a year ago to 59% in the September.Lower costs have resulted in improved profitability. From the lows of 7% in the March 2009 quarter, operating margin expanded to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. At the current price, the scrip commands a P/E multiple of 15 on a trailing 12-month basis. Other injection moulding makers, including Supreme Industries and Wim Plast, are trading at a P/E of nine and seven, respectively. Nilkamal’s higher valuations partly reflect its financial recovery and its expansion plans for plastics retail. The company is investing in its own retail chain under the name @Home across the country. In the September 2009 quarter, it opened two new stores under this brand. At the current level, the stock seems to fully reflect its future potential to expand."

  The company registered impressive results both in sales and profit for 2010-11, a company statement said here.
  
  According to the audited financial results for the year 2010-11, taken on record by the Board of Directors in a meeting held in New Delhi today, NALCO has posted net profit of Rs 1069.30 crore, registering an increase of 31 per cent over previous year's figure of Rs 814.22 crore.

  ""The results would have been still better but for the adverse impact of exchange rate of rupee on sales, which made a dent of Rs 159 crore,"" a senior executive said.
  
  The rise in net profit and sales turnover is mostly attributed to better market realisations, in addition to some contributions by way of higher production and sale of metal.
  
  During the year, average sales realization per tonne of alumina has gone up to USD 350 from USD 264 in 2009-10. Similarly, average sales realization per tonne of aluminium metal jumped to USD 2335 from USD 1946 in the previous year.

  Let’s start with your No. 1 stock idea for next 6 months for our viewers.
   
  My first recommendation is Munjal Auto. Munjal Auto is a Hero Group company which is managed by Sudhir Munjal. It is an automobile ancillary company catering mainly to the 2 wheeler industry. 
  
  This company’s main products are muffler, second is motorcycle rims and third one is scooter wheels. This company has 3 factories. One at Baroda, second at Haryana and third one is at Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Equity capital of this company is 10 crores. 
  
  In the year 2010-2011, this company made a turnover of Rs 521 crores and they made a gross profit of Rs 40 crores and net profit of Rs 25 crores. So on an equity capital of Rs 10 crores, the earning per share was Rs 25. 
  
  The company's management believes in rewarding the investors and hence they have declared Rs 7.5 as dividend. In the current year, in the first 9 months, the company has achieved a turnover of Rs 500 crores and gross of Rs 41 crores and net profit of Rs 30 crores. So one can see that the company has achieved more profit than what is achieved in the last full year."

  Mundra Port corrected quite a bit in the last one month. It has come down about 10-11%, which is much heavier than the index. But today's move looks quite interesting. It is straight off to about a week's high and if this sustains, then that could be pretty much the end of the correction. Otherwise the long-term chart of this stock looks pretty decent. It bottomed out in February. It did not have much of a bear market. So, there seems to be an excellent amount for the stock certainly at around Rs 130, that's held out very nicely for quite a while now and we are not too far above that level. So, if somebody likes the stock, this is not too bad an opportunity to get in, as I said the medium-term correction maybe just about coming to an end now."

Hence, the company’s performance should not be judged from the reaction of stock market.
  
  The MRPL scrip got a severe beating on Wednesday as it fell more than 8% to its 52-week low in spite of a healthy December quarter show. 
  
  At the operational level, the company’s performance was much better, with gross refining margins at $6 per barrel and highest ever throughput of 3.49 million tonne. 
  
  The company’s operating profit grew 87% against the year-ago period. However, the Rs 153-crore foreign exchange gains it had booked last December meant that the growth in gross profit was just 14%. 
  
  Another factor that affected profit growth during the quarter was the provisions for pay revisions of non-managerial staff. The company wrote off Rs 56 crore during the quarter towards arrears of pay revisions with effect from April 2007.
  
  The company is working on a mega-investment programme, which will almost triple its gross block by end FY12. It is implementing a Rs 14,000-crore refinery expansion project to be completed by October. This will not only expand its refining capacity from 12 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes, but also improve its ability to process cheaper varieties of crude oil, which are heavier or with higher sulphur content. 
  
  Another major project will add 0.44 million tonnes of polypropylene capacity by April 2012 at a capital cost of Rs 1,800 crore.
  
  MRPL is also working with ONGC to set up an aromatics complex in a special economic zone near its refinery in Mangalore. The Rs 5,750-crore project is scheduled to be commissioned by end FY13. 
  
  Considering the recent fall in market value and gains in corporate earnings, the company’s valuations dipped to a price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 12.3. The global refining industry appears to have come out of the woods with gross refining margins, or the money a refiner makes on refining each barrel of crude oil, moving up in the December quarter. The first few weeks of the March 2011 quarter indicate that the strength continues, which can prove a key positive for the company going ahead."

ET Now: MRF numbers bring me to that tyre space because funds are actively buying into the tyre companies. We saw evidence of that yesterday with JK Tyre. The stocks are trading at fresh 52-week highs and they are continuing unabated. The Ceat QIP II on right now. what do you make of this space and particularly MRF as well with another quarter of very robust numbers? 
 
 
Dipan Mehta: In the last two-three years, the tyre companies have done exceedingly well. Certain amount of pricing discipline has come through and capacities have not come in place. At the same time, demand has increased pretty well and some of the export markets also have opened up for lot of these tyre companies and, of course, the final benefit was account of lower raw material cost especially rubber and all those benefits are flowing to the top line and the bottom line for most tyre companies. If you see in terms of performance, MRF had a bit of a laggard but after this result, one could clearly conclude that definitely the company has caught up with his peer group and maybe from this point on, it may even do better than its peer group considering its dominant position within the industry.
 
 
ET Now: Right but which is your top bet when it comes to the tyre space. MRF is an expensive stock but nevertheless it has had a strong run?
 
 
Dipan Mehta: Well some of the smaller tyre companies like TVS Srichakra and to an extent even Balkrishna Industries look quite interesting but Balkrishna came out with disappointing set of numbers. So we just like to hold our recommendation over there but TVS Srichakra continues to do exceedingly well and it is kind of a niche player. So that would be the preference but after these numbers of MRF, one would need to look at MRF more closely and understand exactly what went right for the company and that could also turn out to be a good investment opportunity."

ET Now: On the charts Lupin? 

 Rajen Shah: I continue to be extremely bullish on the MNC pharma space. All pharma companies have moved up. Lupin, Wockhardt and a number of other midcap companies have also done very well. But I am a big fan of MNC pharma companies, so I believe that companies like Merck, Wyeth, Novartis, Pfizer are quoting at one-fifth or may be one-tenth of the market cap, what they are quoting in US, not even one-tenth, in fact, much lesser than what they quoting in US. 

 With India probably opening up more and more in future this all MNC companies will certainly try to expand their presence in India because so far they have been neglecting their subsidiaries. You see the market cap of Merck, Wyeth, Novartis and Pfizer, this is peanuts actually. Probably we could also see some delisting thing happening in case of MNC pharma companies. 

 So I feel that the opportunity in the pharma industry is huge so probably these parent companies may get more serious because they have been so far not taking that keen interest in their subsidiaries, so I am a big fan of MNC pharma at these levels.

 The state-run company has been looking for investors to offload its 26 per cent stake in the commodity bourse, Indian Commodity Exchange (ICEX), which wound up its operations towards the end of 2013. Currently, MMTC holds 5.20 crore equity shares in ICEX at a face value of Rs 5 each.
 
 ""The board of directors has ""approved the proposal for sale of 10 per cent of ICEX equity i.e. 5 per cent each, to two bidders who participated in the global tender against the present holding of 26 per cent in ICEX by MMTC at Rs 10 per share subject to the approval by the government and the Forward Markets Commission,"" the company said in a filing to BSE.
 
 ICEX does not have sufficient net worth and requires infusion of funds from existing shareholders as well as investment from fresh shareholders. However, MMTC is is not interested in infusing more funds to increase the net worth of the exchange to meet the regulatory norms, a PTI report said.
 
 MMTC had invited bids for purchase of a minimum 20 lakh shares (equivalent to 1 per cent shareholding in the bourse) at a minimum reserve price of Rs 10 a piece.

The offer for sale (OFS) for 10 per cent of its stake in June 2013 was priced at a 72 per cent discount to the then prevailing stock price. Later in the year, FMC had issued a show-cause notice to ICEX, scrapping its registration because no business has been generated on the exchange since December 2013.
 
 During the end of 2013, the ICEX had decided to wind up operations and trading was accordingly suspended on December 24, 2013 after the business volumes got affected due to several factors including imposition of commodity transaction tax and the Rs 5,500 crore payment scam at NSEL.
 
 Other stakeholders in ICEX include Reliance Exchange Next with 26 per cent, IBFSL and Abhinay Trading Corporation's 14 per cent each, Indian Potash Ltd with 10 per cent, while KRIBHCO and IDFC hold five per cent each in the exchange."
Metal cos are having good volume growth',positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/metal-stocks-are-more-than-just-a-one-hit-wonder/articleshow/82516088.cms,m.economictimes.com,Metal stocks are more than just a one-hit wonder,"Let us not assume that the rally in metal stocks is a one-time story, it could be a compounding story as well, says Charandeep Singh, Founder & MD, Girik Capital in this interview. Also in conversation is Varun Daga, Co-founder & Fund Manager, Girik Capital. Edited excerpts:

How you are looking at the overall set up for the equity markets? The on-ground situation is adverse because of Covid and the FIIs are also continuously pulling out money.
Varun Daga: The market, as we always say, has a mind of its own and is now probably looking into the future. From the earnings side, we have had some good news as many sectors did well. So on the market front, things are looking alright. Markets are not willing to sell off that easily. The bull market looks robust. We have seen pockets of overvaluation at some places, but the overall market looks fine.

Before the second wave, we were doing so well across all sectors and this (Covid 2.0) was a setback. But hopefully, if things get back to normal on the economy side, the market is waiting for that issue to get sorted. Fundamentally, we do not see any big reason (for selloff). Domestic demand might get a little affected but there are a lot of opportunities on the exports side.


How will the inflation in raw material prices impact the FMCG sector, given its high valuation?

Charandeep Singh: There are headwinds in consumption-oriented sectors. There is no doubt that many of these companies are performers. But you have an earnings headwind over here because of commodity price inflation and the consumer slowdown in general. So it is possible that you may not get the desired outcome in terms of long-term IRR in this sector.


One often wonders as to how long is the metals rally going to last. Copper and other base metals are hitting fresh all-time highs. Do you feel that there is more upside left or would you say that the best is behind us?
Charandeep Singh: The last time you saw metals performing was in the rally from 2001 to 2008, and then a little bit at the beginning of this decade. It is very important for us to understand that the profit pools in a lot of these metal companies are cyclical. In the last decade, there were demand headwinds and many of these companies did not make good capital allocation decisions. The markets tend to react in an excessive manner, both pessimistically and optimistically, when it comes to cyclicals. 

But to paint all the companies in the sector with the same brush is not fair. This rally could also be because of restructuring in some of these metal companies in the last decade. They have cleaned up their balance sheets and divested non-core assets. This sector has got consolidated in a large way. In steel, for example, the top 4-5 steel producers in India produce bulk of the metal now. Through the NCLT procedure, a lot of valuable assets got gobbled up. 

The second thing you have is better asset allocation incrementally. Third thing, I would say, is that the best steel companies in India produce a decent return on capital and have a very secular demand scenario. So if you look at them over the last 25-30 years, they have done volume growth north of GDP and that is quite commendable. 

In the near-term, they are benefiting from a great pricing scenario globally. If you are selling 50% more metal, then you have a great chance of creating more operating leverage, especially if you are capital disciplined. 

Let us not assume this is a one-time thing or just a reset. It could be a compounding story as well. We should be open to that.


Is the rerating in speciality chemicals going to continue going forward? Are there opportunities or would you say that the best is in the price already?
Varun Daga: To a large extent, the multiple re-rating is probably done. But in terms of the opportunity size, it is huge. India is a hub for manufacturing and all these companies have become sizable ones now. They are generating enough capital on their own and do not really need to borrow money. So they can take up contracts from anywhere in the globe and produce at the cheapest cost. 

Having said that, they have run up a lot but all we have to focus is on growth and the size of opportunity. There are times when the market corrects and you get enough opportunities where some of these good businesses can be bought.


On pharma stocks
Varun Daga: I do not think the best is behind for pharma. It is a very typical sector because every company has its own fundamentals. There are different sectors within pharma - APIs, formulations, domestic and exports. You need to pick leaders in different areas. The story is still under play and they have better times ahead."

I know it is a truncated trading week but nevertheless it is a very big week for our markets. Are there more legs to this rally? Is the washout of a festive season and supply disruptions getting sorted out?If you see the market patterns, for almost six months now, there has been a very smart rotation at play wherein at different points of time, different sectors are performing. Some sectors are going through a bit of a lull and depending upon the triggers and the developments, certain other sectors are coming into limelight. 
 
Auto has been a performing sector for a while but in the two-wheeler space, the overall performance has not been that great because of the lack of demand. We are not seeing much of an excitement there but the Q2 numbers of most of the companies had indicated that the worst of the chip supply is behind them and gradually we will see the revival in terms of supply. Malaysian chipmakers starting to work at 100% capacity and smart chip issues receding came as a big positive surprise wherein there is a sense that growth will come back.
 
But one has to bear in mind is that the entire update on the improvement in chips is not going to benefit all the companies across. We feel that companies like Maruti and Motherson Sumi would be a bigger beneficiary of this development whereas the companies which are relying upon the European suppliers like JLR and some other global companies, may not benefit immediately. We like Maruti and Motherson Sumi as top picks both in the OEM and auto ancillary space. There is some more leg in terms of the upside for these two names.
 

Out of the three listed stocks and it will be four tomorrow, which is the one new tech stock you think should be part of everyone’s long-term portfolio where you may see a hit of 25% but it should be part of the core portfolio like a HDFC Bank in 2000 or Bajaj Finance in 2010?Even though IPO valuations have been on the higher side, we are seeing that post listing, the overall momentum and the activity around the IPOs have been exceptionally good. We are bringing in a lot of optimism in terms of what sort of growth these companies can throw up over the next three, five, seven years. 
 
Given the sort of dynamics that we are working with, we would really want to focus upon names where at least the basic product or the platform is showing a lot of promise in terms of traction and the management pedigree or the guys who are backing these companies are good. From that perspective, both Zomato and Nykaa are looking pretty promising in terms of what they have built so far. There is no point talking about valuations. It is all about what sort of growth in terms of top line or certain parameters that the market is looking at. We have to have a smaller allocation to these companies if we have to make them part of the portfolio. We have to see how over a period of time, they perform but these two names definitely are looking quite promising in terms of what they have built so far.
 

Which is your favourite unlock trade? Hotel, hospitality, travel, fashion?Retail like Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent are the names where we have seen very remarkable growth come back into the system. The sense we are getting is that the growth from here on is going to be much better. So definitely in terms of open up themes, we like these two names.
 
Apart from that, of course, Indian Hotels has been something that we have been liking a lot and given the fact that in the second half, the general occupancy levels are much better and this time around both in terms of business travel as well as the leisure travel we have seen a good traction. Travel is going to catch up big time over the next two quarters. 
 

In the pre Covid era, hotel stocks were not great wealth creators. Just because Covid has happened and they are making a comeback, some of those stocks are at a new high. Why should we go and buy hotel stocks because they still need capital and the return ratios are cyclical?A good insight. Our take is that you will see some sort of a consolidation play out in the last 12-15 months of this pandemic wherein smaller hotel units have shut down and the bigger guys have consolidated and a lot of cost controls have happened because of the way things have been for the hospitality sector. There are advantages of a much better positioning in the hospitality space, cost controls and the fact that the way things are going to shape up, the pricing environment and the occupancy levels are going to be much better.
 
The entire operating leverage could play out over the next 12-18 months and that would lead to some sort of a rerating of the larger players. I agree that it has not been one of the best performing sectors in terms of wealth creation, but from a technical positioning, given the way things have been, we think there is going to be a lot of excitement around the numbers that these companies are going to throw up and that could lead to some sort of a rerating.
 

We have also started seeing the API focus pharmaceutical stocks make a comeback. How are you approaching this entire sector now that the base effect of Covid will also no longer be at play?One thing which Covid and the entire sequence of events which happened in the last 12-15 months has taught us is that healthcare and diagnostics are going to be extremely critical from an overall lifestyle perspective. We all may get a little more cautious in terms of how to approach the healthcare and the kind of precautions that we need to take to see that we are a little better prepared to deal with any eventuality that would lead to much higher revenue for both healthcare companies as well as diagnostic companies.
 
We will see a big traction there. In terms of allocation, we think names like Apollo are going to be important because this is one stock which has done very well even with Covid and without Covid. The way they have expanded I think it is going to be a big beneficiary. Diagnostic is an area where one could see a lot of allocation because of the way things are. One should have a decent amount of allocation for these two sectors in the portfolio.
 

Why did you tweet about Ipca Labs today morning?Ipca numbers were not great and the stock has been a laggard for about two quarters. In healthcare and some of these companies where the overall growth is going to be slightly muted, the performance may not be that great. It is a good stock for somebody who wants to play the export and the API part but the overall growth triggers or the excitement factor would be missing in the near term.
 
 One should focus on Sun Pharma or Divi’s where the overall growth visibility is much better or even Gland Pharma where the stock has corrected from Rs 4,000 to Rs 3,500, but the growth visibility and the triggers are much better."
Short-covering ahead of Q3 results lifts Maruti,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/short-covering-ahead-of-q3-results-lifts-maruti/articleshow/5483785.cms,m.economictimes.com,Short-covering ahead of Q3 results lifts Maruti,"Shares of Maruti Suzuki rose nearly 3 per cent on Wednesday to close at Rs 1,456.95, backed by good volumes. The stock has been among the laggards in the large-cap segment over the past couple of segments. This, in spite of the fact that some of the company's recently launched models, has evoked a very good response. Dealers tracking the counter say that Maruti's operating margins could be under pressure for some time, considering that its rivals happen to be some of the biggest names in the global arena. They attributed the rise in the stock to shortcovering of positions by ahead of the company's third quarter results due next week."
Risks factored in; markets to remain upwardly-bound,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/risks-factored-in-markets-to-remain-upwardly-bound/articleshow/12155839.cms,m.economictimes.com,Risks factored in; markets to remain upwardly-bound,"By Gaurav Mehta
  
  The uncertainty around UP and other state elections has dominated investor attention of late -- so with the event outcome now imminent on this very day, the markets can be expected to be volatile, in the least. 
  
  However, from an overall trend perspective, both Nifty and Bank Nifty indices remain in an upward trend. Barring any exceptionally adverse outcome, we think that downsides, if any, should be limited and be used as buying opportunities. 
  
  The recent surge in Nifty implied volatility along with a significant addition in put positions clearly suggests that market participants have already taken ample protective measures. 
  
  It further indicates that there is low probability of sharp downside reactions. 
  
  We, thus, remain positive on Nifty, Bank Nifty in the medium term. From a stock-specific perspective we like Tata Motors and Voltas on the long side. 
  
  However, on the flip side we think FMCG stocks, especially Hindustan Unilever, look vulnerable to downside move. A break below 378 in the stock has the potential to shave off another 10% and, hence, should be used to create short positions.

  Stepping into the week because now we are going talk about earnings, what is it that you will be focussing on? 
  
  In general what we are going to see is growth coming in from most of the spaces, particularly you are going to see some of the heavyweights coming out with better numbers. We are going to see numbers coming good from Reliance side. 
  
  Also some of the banking stocks, private sector banks particularly where they did not have to do some provisioning kind of thing in the balance sheets. So they should be coming out with better numbers. IT companies we are expecting in general about between 15% and 20% growth reported in the bottom line. So auto companies for sure would definitely demand good amount of attention. 
  
  For a rally that they have seen in the volume, they should get reflected into the bottom line performance of this company. So overall, one can easily expect that the first quarter earning estimates would probably lead to somewhere around 25% growth in the financial year 2010-2011 and that should provide a much larger comfort to the investors to look at the Indian market. 
  
  Because if that being the situation and we are trading at around 16.5 times on a forward 9-month earning estimate basis for this financial year which would be sufficient enough for somebody to look at this market very positively. So I am reasonably confident that yes, overall, the macro aspects if they are coming under control in particular European economy related, my reading says that emerging markets like India would definitely demand better attention and we should be seeing further upside continuing in our market. 
  
  Though it would be very stock specific direction but it will be certainly there in our markets. So reasonably, we are remaining confident in that aspect."
Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/macros-suddenly-turning-supportive-for-markets-ajay-bodke/articleshow/38466461.cms,m.economictimes.com,Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,"In a chat with ET Now, Ajay Bodke, Head-Investment Strategist & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher, shares his views on the markets.
 
 
ET Now: Just when it appeared that Indian markets were looking slightly rusty, last 60 minutes yesterday made all the difference. What did the trick for us?
 
 
Ajay Bodke: What clearly is evident is that the macro variables are suddenly turning supportive for India. We saw some of the key data variables coming over the last few weeks. Be it the IIP number for May at 4.7 per cent where after nearly 15 quarters, the consumer durable numbers have done positive at 3.2 per cent. Followed by a four-month low WPI number that came in last week and a CPI number which presently surprised the market at 7.3 per cent which is the lowest since the new series has been started being computed from January 2012. So these are the issues that have been taken positively by the market.
 
 Also globally the crude prices, coal prices, iron and steel prices are clearly showing to be under control. Let us not forget that 75 per cent of India’s trade deficit is the oil and 12 per cent of India’s trade deficit is coal. So you are essentially looking at a substantial chunk of a trade deficit and the commodities contributing them on a downward trend. That is bringing cheer back to the market in addition to the budget which in view of the very tight fiscal space available to the Finance Minister has presented an admirable budget.
 
 Especially with drought looming in the wheat bowl as well as central parts of India as well as only 7 regions out of 36 sub-metro divisions getting excess rainfall and the rest of either having scanty or deficit rainfall. So we have to keep a very close watch on a weekly basis about the sowing data and on the progress of the monsoons. But overall, we are in my opinion over the hump and the market should consolidate at the current level."
Markets to remain in an uptrend: Mitesh Thacker,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/markets-to-remain-in-an-uptrend-mitesh-thacker/articleshow/31411460.cms,m.economictimes.com,Markets to remain in an uptrend: Mitesh Thacker,"In a chat with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on market. 

 
ET Now: What are your closing comments? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: For me, this is a market which remains in an uptrend but now very close to important supply points. Typically, a good way to trade this kind of situation would be to tighten your stop losses. In case, the market fails to give a breakout, we might see it get back into this broad 180-200 point range with the 6180-6160 as support and 6320-6350 as the upper end of the range.
 
 In case there is a good breakout happening, then we might want to look at higher levels and if the Nifty manages to get pass 6350-6360 on a closing basis, good chance that we will head towards 6480-6500 sometime during the March expiry. So the bias is positive but given the fact that we are very close to historical levels, tactically we are trading with shorter stop losses. Individual stock I am still positive, the Nifty midcap index has given a strong buy signal and maybe the breadth might do better than the broader index."

Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/long-term-bonds-appear-to-be-the-magic-wand/articleshow/38833689.cms,m.economictimes.com,Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan last week performed a sex reassignment surgery on the Indian banking sector. He permitted banks to raise funds selling long-term bonds to build infrastructure. The logic was that building infrastructure is time-consuming, so it needed to be funded by long-term funds instead of short-term deposits, the mainstay of banks.


	Just a few months ago, RBI bought the argument of IDFC, an institution created exclusively to fund infrastructure projects, that its survival will be under threat if it keeps borrowing long-term through bonds. It granted a licence to IDFC to turn itself into a bank so that it can take deposits. The logic was it makes eminent sense to take deposits and lend rather than through bonds for 10 years. That could be done only if IDFC changes its gender, the wish that Rajan granted.


	How is it that in a matter of few months the regulator buys two different arguments, and grants opposite wishes? Is the regulator framing policies for industry, or individual cases determine what the policy is?


	The irony is that this is not the first time that the Indian financial sector is undergoing gender reassignment, but the second time in less than two decades. In the 1990s, development financial institutions led by ICICI converted into banks with a ‘convert or perish’ campaign espoused by its then chief K V Kamath. ICICI Bank succeeded, IDBI Bank managed to remain afloat following it. But the one that chose to retain the financial institution character, IFCI, is nearly irrelevant.


	If borrowing long term and lending was a wrong business model then for ICICI and now for IDFC, how is it that it’s good for banks? Are we making the entire banking system into development financial institutions?


	It was not the dearth of funds, but the composition of funding and lending that landed the Indian banking industry in a soup. Years of lending short-term bank funds to long-term projects, throwing the basics of asset-liability management to the winds, made banks shaky. When the interest rate cycle turned higher and the economy slowed, all the sins of the bull market came back to haunt. There is nothing to show that it will be different in the next cycle.


	Keeping in mind the ICICI and IDFC experience, it would have been wiser to ask: why did banks lend long-term instead of permitting them to sell long-term bonds? It also doesn't help in the efficient development of bond markets. Why should banks compete with its own customers in the same market for funds?


	 

	If banks are smart, they should not sell bonds, or stop just with token bond issues. If they go all out as if there is no tomorrow, they may well be sowing the seeds of the next banking crisis. The current one is because their funds are short term and lending is long term. The next one will be the flip side of it – longer term funds and short-term assets.


	There is near-unanimity that Indian interest rate cycle is at its peak now, and the only direction for rates is to head south. It is the outcome for which Rajan is working so hard. So, goading banks to borrow long term at current interest rates is something similar to what US Federal Reserve former chairman Alan Greenspan did to mortgage borrowers. Greenspan advised individual borrowers to shift to floating rates. That turned out to be the worst financial advice that anyone could give. It left millions homeless.


	Given the Indian financial tradition and the smartness of borrowers, the dice will be loaded against banks in the case of long-term bonds.


	At current interest rates, banks may be borrowing at near 10% without a call or put option. But they may be lending to someone who may have the choice of refinancing the loan at a lower rate when interest rates ease. Not many borrowers will accept covenants that prevent such a switch. So, the liability of banks will be for longer term, and assets could be of a shorter duration.


	Apart from Indian banking coming a full circle, it also raises the question of which is the right model. The truth is there is no formula for good profits all the time. It’s the quest for profitability that drives managements to compromise on prudence and overdo anything that delivers profits.


	This is the beginning of the next boom for the Indian economy. For the banking industry, long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand that will bring them out of the current mess and set them on the path to eternal profitability.


	What may begin as a trickle may quickly gather pace. The test will be how many guard against getting carried away. If there are excesses, then the system may end up being a eunuch once again looking for a gender change."

The stock has gained 9% in the past one month against a flat Sensex. The stock made its 52-week high of Rs 275 on January 4. KKCL’s performance on bourses has been outstanding. For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 37%, and it has doubled in six months. The stock gave an annual return of 113% beating the Sensex as well the ET Retail Index that rose 86% and 80% during the period, respectively. KKCL, which clocked revenues of Rs 159.4 crore in the past four quarters, manufactures jeans, semi-formals and casual wear under the brands Killer, Integriti, Lawman and Easies. Killer is the flagship brand that commands the highest margin for KKCL. Around 3-4% of KKCL’s sales are from exports to Asia, Middle East and the US. The company has doubled its net profit in the first half of FY10 against that reported in the same period a year ago. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters and will continue to do so in the future due to economies of scale on account of increased production capacity. Besides volume, average realisation has also gone up. The company sells products on a consignment basis, thus transferring the risk to its franchisee. \This asset-light strategy, coupled with integration and low-working capital requirements enables the company to enjoy higher returns on equity and on capital employed. In FY09, the company cleared a lot of its pending stock and has maintained low inventory levels since then, which will help in maintaining margins. The company reported net sales of Rs 57 crore in the September 2009 quarter, up 19% from the corresponding period a year ago. Operating profit at Rs 16.3 crore and a net profit at 11.5 crore were the highest since the time the company got listed in 2006. It has improved its debt to equity ratio from 0.17x on March 2009 to 0.10x as on September 2009. It also has surplus cash of Rs 105 crore, which leaves enough scope for further expansion. At Rs 267 and an annualised EPS of Rs 28.8 for FY10, the stock is valued at 9.3x its earnings, which makes it a good buy at this point of time. Going ahead, it could be a good turnaround stock for one’s portfolio."

Maintain overweight stance on IT sector: Gautam Chhaochharia,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/maintain-overweight-stance-on-it-sector-gautam-chhaochharia/articleshow/32776348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Maintain overweight stance on IT sector: Gautam Chhaochharia,"In a chat with ET Now, Gautam Chhaochharia, Head-India Research, UBS, shares his views on the rupee and it will affect the IT sector. 

 
ET Now: Do you think the rupee adjustment in large cap IT stocks is not fully captured or could IT stocks see some more downside given the way how the rupee has appreciated? 

 
Gautam Chhaochharia: We still maintain our overweight stance on IT services sectors. What we have seen till now is more of a sector rotation rather than reflecting the rupee appreciation and on the other hand we would also like to point out or argue that the levels of rupee at 62-63 was not really factored into most of the street earnings estimates because it was just for a short period of time. 

 So in that context, I do not think the rupee will move either from Rs 60 to Rs 63 levels or the move back has played a big role. It has been more a sector rotation trade which has happened specifically given EM flows globally. So investors have been forced to do more sector rotation rather than add significant positions on India. 

 The second point to highlight from our perspective, where we still maintain our overweight position on IT, is that for us IT is not just about a currency play. So that is one small short-term tactical issue, but the two bigger drivers for was, one, this recovery being seen in the US and Europe, which continues. 

 Secondly, the building blocks for more medium-term growth visibility for this sector is now emerging in the form of infrastructure and BPO sectors which have achieved scale and which can provide growth visibility not just for next one-two years, but for the longer term which is critical for valuations to sustain or even rerate from the current levels."

 Operating margin will be under pressure due to onsite wage hikes and a limited support from the currency movements. In addition, the revenue guidance for FY14 will likely be far more optimistic than the prior year considering the momentum in winning new accounts, believe analysts.
 
 Infosys, the second largest IT exporter among those listed on Indian bourses will declare its quarterly and annual financial performance on Friday, April 12, 2013.
 
 According to the average estimates of the forecasts by eight brokerages and estimates of ET Intelligence Group, Infosys is expected to report 3% increase in revenue in the March 2013 quarter from the previous quarter. Net profit, however, will fall by 3% sequentially reflecting analysts’ expectation of pressure on profitability.
 
 The consolidation of Lodestone’s business is likely to add 1-2% in the dollar terms to Infosys’s topline for the quarter, which means the core business growth will likely be muted at around 2% compared with the previous quarter’s 6% sequential jump. Volume growth is expected to be over 1.5%, lower than 2% in the previous quarter.
 
 The company increased onsite salaries by 2-3%, which will impact the operating profitability marginally for the March quarter.
 
 Investors will await to see whether the company continues to provide annual performance guidance given rising uncertainty in the global demand scenario. Analysts expect 9-12% revenue growth guidance from Infosys for FY14. This is higher than the anticipated 6% increase in the FY13 revenue."

 The bank said net profit rose to Rs 421.06 crore from Rs 334.84 crore in the year-ago quarter. Core fee income rose 38% to Rs 487 crore. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and paid out, rose 18% to Rs 801 crore.
 
 Shares of IndusInd Bank fell after the results were announced. The stock lost 1.65% to close at Rs 543.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on a day when the exchange’s benchmark index, the Sensex, slipped 0.54%.
 
 “We have grown our net profit powered by core fee income, which was also up 10% quarter-on-quarter,” said Romesh Sobti, MD and CEO at IndusInd Bank. “There has been rock-stable quality of our loan book.”
 
 The bank expanded its loans by 24% y-o-y to Rs 58,664 crore. Corporate loans rose 38% to Rs 33,300 crore, while retail or consumer finance loans were up just 9% at 25,364 crore.
 
 The ratio of corporate to retail loans stood at 57:43 compared with 51:49 a year ago. The bank said it plans to expand retail lending in the current fiscal as it sees good demand for vehicle financing in the coming quarters on the back of economic optimism.
 
 “In commercial vehicle segment, there is definitely demand picking up. Mining bans are being lifted in some states,” Sobti said, adding that all vehicle loans will have good demand. Demand for two-wheeler loans was significantly higher in the vehicle loans segment.
 
 The lender’s net bad loans or non-performing asset ratio stood at 0.33% versus 0.21% in the year-ago quarter.
 
 The bank has provided Rs 20 crore for corporate clients having un-hedged exposures as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India a few months ago. However, the bank has provided double the amount it actually required.
 
 According to Sobti, the profit level would have been higher without this provision. There could be a possibility of write-back of this provision if all banks decide to pass on the cost to their borrowing companies.
 
 “I certainly feel, achhe din aane wale hein (good days are set to come). A lot of political capital has been created due to the mandate (given to the new government). Markets are up. It means some stressed companies can access market for raising capital,” he said."

 According to analysts, it’s a shot in the arm for IGL. People were waiting for the stock to get its due.

India Incs RoE may improve this fiscal,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/india-incs-roe-may-improve-this-fiscal/articleshow/45802524.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,India Inc’s RoE may improve this fiscal,"MUMBAI: A popular return ratio that was one of the key parameters used by analysts to highlight the Indian corporate growth story between 2003 and 2007 may be showing signs of improving. Indian companies’ return on equity (RoE) — a measure of a firm’s efficiency at maximising profits for shareholders — which in 2013-14 hit the lowest level in a decade, is expected to pick up in the current financial year driven by possible decline in interest rates, margin recovery and improved asset turnover ratio, said HSBC.  	RoE is expected to increase from 15% in 2013-14 to 16.5% by 2015-16. Indian companies’ RoE hit a peak of 22% in 2005. Although RoE has fallen in all major markets over the past few years on weaker global growth, RoE contraction in India has been among the most severe.  	“Although we do not expect RoE to return to the highs of 2005-08 anytime soon, we believe it has bottomed and expect profitability to improve,” said Jitendra Sriram, equity strategist and head of research, HSBC in a note. “We forecast RoE to rise 150 bps by FY16 and 200 bps by FY17 from the current level of 15%,” he said.  	HSBC expects materials and industrials to contribute significantly to the expected increase in India’s overall RoE  	HSBC said companies’ ROE compression was triggered by factors such as the decline in corporate profitability, increases in interest rates and a rising component of overseas revenues. The cost of doing business in India has gone up sharply due to factors such as an increase in the cost of inputs, difficulty in acquiring land and tougher environmental regulation, said the note.  	RBI hiked rates 13 times between March 2010 and October 2011 as it attempted to curb inflationary pressures. HSBC research shows the main drag on India’s overall RoE has clearly come from domestic cyclical sectors. The industrial sector’s RoE plunged from 34% in March 2005 to an all-time low of 11% in the last fiscal year ending March 2014."

Ashwani Gujral: IDFC may have bounce backs but I do not think it will be sustainable. 105 now is a fairly strong resistance. Broadly it should head lower towards levels of about 75-76. A lot of these stocks are now getting to the 20% gap that we had for election. 

 So, once they start filling that gap, there is literally nothing for the next 15-20% on most of these stocks. That is something that people should keep in mind that more falls from here means that everything settles at least 15-20% lower."

"Hind Sanitaryware not so fragile now, improving fortunes",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hind-sanitarywares-not-so-fragile-now-improving-fortunes/articleshow/32758061.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Hind Sanitaryware's not so fragile now, improving fortunes","MUMBAI: With a growing number of consumers shifting to branded products, India’s largest sanitary ware company Hindustan Sanitaryware Industries (HSIL) is poised to benefit the most from the double-digit growth of the organised sanitary ware industry.
 
 Its glass-packaging business is also set for a turnaround, which would lead to non-linear earnings growth in the next two years. “We will grow at least 20% for the next two years in the bathroom products business. We are the price setters and we have been consistently outpacing the industry,” Sandip Somany, managing director of HSIL, told ET. “In our glass business, the losses are declining and we expect the business to become profitable at operating levels in the first half of 2014-15.”
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Though HSIL’s stock has gained 30% in the past month, it still continues to be under-valued if the two businesses — sanitary ware and glass — are to be valued independently. In the first nine months of the current fiscal, the operating profit (EBIT) of HSIL’s bathroom products grew 24%. Its profit after tax for the trailing 12 months is around Rs110 crore.
 
 Its peers — Cera and Kajaria — are trading at earnings multiples of 24 and 22, respectively. Giving HSIL a conservative multiple of 20, its building product business should be valued at Rs2,000 crore. But the company’s market capitalisation is only Rs830 crore. This is despite the company’s strong growth and margins compared with its peers. (see table) The reason for this is the glasspackaging business, which after being a drag for the last two years, is now on the road to recovery. HSIL has increased prices of the glass container business after almost two years.
 
 After growing at 27% CAGR from FY08-FY12, HSIL’s glass business started slowing down due to over capacity in the industry and the overall slowdown, especially consumption of beverages, beer and liquor. But the consumption is likely to pick up. Liquor and beer companies make up 60% of the business’ clients. Stocks of companies such as United Spirits and United Breweries are some of the most expensive stocks listed (P/E of more than 100) as the Street expects the consumption to pick up. HSIL offers a good proxy play at much lower valuations.
 
 “Industry discipline in terms of few furnace shutdowns seen last year should help improve demand-supply fundamentals. Various cost-control measures should yield operating leverage for HSIL as growth revives,” said Saurabh Kumar, analysts with JP Morgan in a recent report. With its strong presence in the high-growth sanitary business and potential turnaround in the glass business, the stock is due for a re-rating. In the past, consumer discretionary companies such as TTK Prestige, Asian Paints and Hawkins that enjoyed similar market positions in their respective industries, have become multi-baggers."
PE entry to help Himadri fund expansion,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pe-entry-to-help-himadri-fund-expansion/articleshow/5408138.cms,m.economictimes.com,PE entry to help Himadri fund expansion,"MUMBAI: Private equity Bain Capital has bought a 15.4% stake in Kolkata-based Himadri Chemicals in a move which will support the chemical company’s plan to triple capacity.The Rs 600-crore deal that includes an open offer to Himadri’s retail shareholders, will part-finance the company’s Rs 1,600-crore expansion plan that will raise its coal tar capacity to 400,000 tonne and forward integrate into other products for use in construction and auto industries, CEO Anurag Choudhary told ET.Coal tar is a high viscous liquid by-product derived from coal gas, and is widely used by the auto sector, specially by electric cars that are powered by lithium ion batteries. It is also used with readymix concrete to reduce usage of cement in construction. Bain Capital Private Equity had large chemicals businesses in its portfolio in the past, including firms such as Rhodia, paints maker SigmaKalon and Germany’s Trespaphan.Bain Capital private equity India head Amit Chandra could be nominated on the board of Himadri, although a final decision on the issue would be made after the completion of the open offer, which would likely raise Bain’s shareholding to a maximum of 35%, said a person connected with the development. According to Anurag Choudhary, Bain’s association is also to enable his company go global. “We had bid for Germany’s Rutgers in 2007, but withdrew due to high valuations. Now we might revisit our global plans,” he added.The company plans to set up a plant in China’s Shandong province in partnership with a local firm. The Choudharys will own 97% in that Chinese venture. “We want to have a total capacity of 1 mt in 3 years that will make us the top three producer globally,” he added. The focus of the PE deal with Himani, one of the few initiated in 2009, is also the emphasis on domain expertise, a pre-condition that most limited partners in PE funds have been insisting on after valuations plunged post the liquidity crisis. Large investors in a PE firm are referred to as limited partners. They provide capital to be invested in selected assets for returns after, typically, three to five years.A recent survey of major PE limited partners by KPMG, found many of them sought stronger operating skills as the downturn progressed into 2009 and as the falling tide exposed the internal problems of portfolio firms. “As LPs will make clear through their choice of fund managers, it is this factor more than any other that will likely separate the successful PE firm from its peers over the next few years,” said the survey."

HDFC third quarter net rises 12%,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/hdfc-third-quarter-net-rises-12/articleshow/29225501.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,HDFC third quarter net rises 12%,"MUMBAI: Housing Finance Development Corp on Wednesday met expectations with a 12 per cent increase in the third-quarter net profit, as demand for loans from individual home buyers remained healthy despite a slowdown in the economy. Net profit for the October-December period rose to Rs 1,278 crore from Rs 1,140 crore a year earlier, the country’s oldest mortgage lender said.
 
 Net interest margin, or the difference between funding costs and interest earned on loans, was nearly flat at 4 per cent compared with 4.06 per cent a year earlier. Net interest income, which is comparable with revenue for companies in other sectors, rose nearly 16 per cent to Rs 1,829 crore.
 
 While demand for funds has slowed in a weak economy, the housing finance sector has remained somewhat insulated. Individual home buyers, who are driving this demand, have also been repaying their loans regularly, helping lenders offset slippages in other loan categories.
 
 For instance, at HDFC, bad loans in the retail portfolio fell to 0.57 per cent in the December quarter from 0.62 per cent a year earlier. This helped limit its overall non-performing assets – which rose to 0.77 per cent of total loans from 0.75 per cent – despite NPA in the non-individual segment almost doubling to 1.81 per cent.
 
 Vice-chairman Keki Mistry said the lender will focus more on growing its individual loan book. “We expect the loan book to grow in the range of 18-20 per cent,” he said. Mistry predicted its cost of funds to remain flat because “ interest rates are expected to remain stable”.
 
 HDFC’s total outstanding loans grew 19.5 per cent to more thanRs 1.92 lakh crore at the end of December. “Most of the housing finance companies, including HDFC and LIC Housing Finance, have seen growth in loan portfolio,” said Kajal Gandhi, a banking analyst at ICICI Securities.
 
 
 
“We have a positive outlook on the sector.” But competition is intensifying, with banks aggressively targeting the home buyer at a time when demand for funds from other segments of the economy is low. “HDFC has managed to maintain its net interest margin because of its sheer size and good liability management,” said Gandhi.
 
 Rikesh Parikh, vice-president of institutional corporate broking at Motilal Oswal Securities, said HDFC’s plan to focus on smaller cities to boost growth in a slowing economy is a positive sign.
 
 According to him, HDFC’s asset quality has remained healthy over the past several quarters and the trend is likely to continue. The lender’s capital adequacy ratio for the quarter ended December was 19.1 per cent compared with 17.5 per cent a year earlier."

  ”The historically highest ever price of Rs 96/kg of groundnut oil was recorded on September 13 in Rajkot market. The prices have come down during the last few days as a new crop is likely to arrive in the market Dusserra onwards,” said GG Patel, an oil broker in Rajkot. The wholesale price of groundnut oil in Rajkot on September 30 was Rs 83/kg. 
  
  Cargill’s Gemini brand refined groundnut oil has an MRP of Rs 135/kg in Pune. However, sources in Cargill said the oil is expected to be sold at Rs 105-110/kg. 
  
  Cargill India spokesperson said, “There is pressure on the supply side as it is the end of the season. The prices will start easing when the new season will begin from October end.”
  
  Groundnut oil, considered a premium variety, accounts for 7-8% of the total edible oil consumption of the country. Gujarat accounts for 40% groundnut production. The rest is produced by Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 
  
  “As groundnut kernels are increasingly being used for direct human consumption, lesser amounts are becoming available for oil extraction,” said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association of India.

Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/four-wheelers-propel-growth-for-greaves-cotton/articleshow/32816242.cms,m.economictimes.com,Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,"For Greaves Cotton, sliding sales volumes of three-wheelers since the quarter to March FY12 was a major worry, since it was a major supplier of engines to three-wheelers. Three-wheeler sales volumes were severely impacted as freight operators moved to lower horse power, or HP, four-wheeler vehicles such as Tata Motors Ace and M&M Gio, which are classified as small commercial vehicles, or SCVs. 

 The Greaves Cotton management then decided to shift focus from the three-wheeler companies to the SCV segment, hoping this would deliver revenue growth higher than its core business catering to three-wheelers. Through the “hub & spoke” model, which involves transporting goods through highways by heavy vehicles and then using small vehicles for city roads, the company supplied SCV engines to Tata Motors for Ace Zip and the Magic Iris model. 

 The company’s SCV engine volumes now account for 14 per cent of its total engine volumes, compared with a negligible contribution three years ago. Says Sunil Pahilajani, MD & CEO, Greaves Cotton, “Our focus has changed to auto original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) side, from being a threewheeler supplier to a complete solution provider to the SCV segment. In trying times, our focus has been on adding to the product range, adding more customers and to enter various categories.” 

 After Pahilajani took charge of the company two years ago, he ensured there was a CEO for each segment and spun off the after-sales segment as a separate division. Revenue from the after-sales segment now accounts for 15% of the company’s total revenue and it enjoys a high margin compared to the other segments. Given the economic slowdown, which impacted volumes of power gensets and the industrial engines segment, the company targeted augmenting revenues from the after-sales segment and to increase its exports. 

 “We are able to maintain revenue growth from the after-sales segment, when industry players have seen a significant dip in revenues from this vertical. Revenue from after-sales has partially offset pressures emanating from other verticals,” said Pahilajani. He said the company is planning to increase revenue contribution from the export market to 10% in the next three years from 3% now. The company’s plant now works at 70 per cent capacity utilisation. 

 In the next few quarters, Greaves Cotton’s farm equipment segment is expected to do well and its contribution to the company’s total revenues is expected to rise as the company is making inroads into the electric pump-set market, which has a market size of.`3,000 crore. Besides, the company has a 50% market share in the petrol and kerosene market and has 1,000 retail touch points in India. It also plans to grab market share in the highly fragmented electric pump market. 

 But what could be a big threat to the company in the next few quarters is the possibility of revenue growth being affected if auto companies start manufacturing engines themselves. Besides, a heavy monsoon, drought or floods can also impact its revenue growth. More importantly, the company’s revenue growth is linked to the revival of the road sector, which has been struggling owing to a fall in traffic, high interest rates and policy paralysis. 

 According to Bloomberg data, the company’s revenues and profits are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% and 23 per cent, respectively, in the FY09-15 period. Greaves Cotton has attracted considerable interest from domestic mutual funds, based on its high earnings potential in the coming years. Fund houses such as Reliance and IDFC hold 8 per cent and 5 per cent stake, respectively, in the company."
Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/greaves-cotton-set-to-flourish-with-improving-margins/articleshow/48721599.cms,m.economictimes.com,Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,"Greaves Cotton saw a 10% fall in revenue year on year (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2015-16. The exit from the infrastructure equipment business is the main reason behind this fall in revenue. Delayed recovery in four-wheeler small commercial vehicle segment and a sluggish growth in farm equipment segment, due to slow release of subsidies and small increase in minimum support price, have also contributed to this revenue contraction. But, despite the fall in revenue, the company has impressed the market because of a robust growth in profit.
 
 
Improvement in margins helped the company report an adjusted net profit growth of 22% y-o-y. The reported net profit growth is up 51% y-o-y. The net profit this time also contains a one-time profit related to the sale of properties. The 527 basis points margin improvement, y-o-y, in the first quarter, is largely attributable to Cotton Greaves’s exit from the infrastructure equipment business, which was making continuous losses at the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level. Improved operational efficiencies, such as reduction in material and employee costs, further contributed to better margins.
 
 Though Greaves Cotton is into the manufacturing of engines that work on almost all fossil fuels—petrol, diesel, kerosene—and can used in automobiles—threewheelers, four-wheeler small commercial vehicles—fishing boats, agri pumps, etc., most of its revenue comes from the automobile segment. Greaves Cotton, with a market share of 85%, is the biggest player in the three-wheeler auto segment.
 
 To augment its auto engine business further, the company has developed engines that can be fitted on vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tonne, a major jump from the previous level of 0.8 tonne. The company should see a significant improvement in its four-wheeler engine market share, currently at 14%, in the coming years. In July, the company signed a deal with Eicher-Polaris for its 600 cc four-wheeler vehicle, Multix, and is trying to get one more four-wheeler company on board during this financial year. Besides new tie-ups, a ramp up in volumes from existing partners is also possible, given the increase in the company’s engine offerings.
 
 
The future looks extremely bright for Greaves Cotton and as per the consensus analysts’ estimate, its net profit is expected to zoom to Rs 211 crore in 2016-17, an annualised 59% gain compared to 2014-15. This fast-growing company’s stock is quoting at reasonable valuations and, therefore, investors can buy it for long-term investment.

Though jewellery sales gathered momentum, the metal lost its lustre among investors as a lucrative instrument to park funds. Bullion dealers said there has been panic selling as news spread that gold has entered a bearish mode. 

 Rajiv Popley, director of Mumbai-based Popley & Sons, said: “Demand has surged at least by 15-20% in the past two days. Buyers are placing orders for Akshay Tritiya which is on May 13. We also had a good Gudi Padwa, which marks the beginning of the new year according to the Hindu calendar.” 

 What is enthusing the jewellers is that consumers are buying jewellery for own use and not for weddings and festivals. “This is a good sign for jewellers. We are seeing that demand has drifted from diamond-studded jewellery to pure gold jewellery. The ratio of gold jewelley to gold investment products is now 65:35. But at this level investment demand is likely to fall by 50%,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director, Nemichand Bamalwa, and past chairman of All India Gem and Jewellery Trade Federation. 

 In 2012, jewellery demand in India slipped to 552 tonne from 618.3 tonne in 2011 largely due to rising prices. 

 The import price rose because the rupee weakened against the dollar, pushing up the landed cost of the metal. Investment demand in 2012 was at 312.2 tonne, which slipped from 368 tonne in 2011, according to World Gold Council data. 

 Bullion dealers say jewellers are not entering the market though the price has fallen as they would like to liquidate the inventories first. “There is hardly any buying from jewellers as there is a feeling that prices will come down to Rs 24,200 per 10 gm. Silver is expected to fall to Rs 39,000 per 1 kg,” said Suresh Hundia, director, Hundia Exports, a leading Mumbai -based bullion dealer. 

 In Bangalore, demand for jewellery has surged by 30% in the past two days. Venkatesh Babu, owner of Bangalore-based Chetna Jewellers & Bullion, said: “Footfall has increased and consumers are buying gold for their own use. However, investors are staying away at the moment and they are waiting for the price to stabilise.” 

 Analysts say gold may bounce back to Rs 26, 000 in the near term. Kishore Narne, associate director & head, Commodity & Currency, Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker, said the plunge in gold prices seems to be ending as it has broken all near-term supports and had a free fall over the last two trading sessions. 

 “The next big support for gold exists at $1,310 and we expect that support to hold for the near term,” he said.“A pullback towards $1,400 an ounce looks possible and holding above that can extend it towards $1,440. The crash in gold prices is close to the near term bottom and will start to see pullback and consolidation. 

 Gold will take support between Rs 25,200-25,100 and can bounce from there towards Rs 25,800-26,000. Sustaining below Rs 25,000 can push the prices towards Rs 24,500-24,200 in the coming days. 

 Silver has given up all gains over the last 2 years and will continue to trade weak. Pullbacks look due and can extend towards Rs 45,000-45,500 per kg,” he added."

The global economic crisis and the resultant volatility have led to the need for diversification of portfolios and increased the importance of risk management. It’s during such times that gold’s fundamental characteristics stand out as a hedge against inflation and preserver of wealth.

Besides, there is a continued erosion of purchasing power of the world’s key currencies, rising inflation and, of late, the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. Little wonder then that the metal has risen since 2002.

According to the World Gold Council's (WGC) latest report, the global demand in the second quarter of 2012-13 stood at 990 tonne, down 7% on a year-on-year basis due to the weak demand in jewellery, investment and technology. The net buying trend by banks, which started in the second quarter of 2009, continued in this quarter as well. The demand by central banks and official institutions in the developing countries increased 63% to 157.5 tonne. Gold's cultural heartland, India and China, continued to dominate the consumer demand segment, contributing 45% to the total jewellery, bar and coin demand.

The consumer demand for gold in China for the second quarter of 2012 was 145 tonne, down 7% y-o-y due to the economic slowdown and lack of a clear price trend. In the first quarter of 2012, the demand rose to a record 255.2 tonne, overtaking that of India. In India, the monetary tightening, rapid depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, economic slowdown, stubborn inflation, high interest rates and fear of weak monsoons curtailed the gold demand as prices touched a record high of Rs 31,422 per 10 gm.

The upward trend has continued since 2000 and gold has performed well compared with other asset classes, with a CAGR of 17% from 2000 through 2011 and a notable 22% during 2010 and 2011. Gold has posted a 13% year-to-date return, whereas the Sensex yielded 12% during this period.

India's gold imports rose to 969 tonne, amounting to $60 billion in 2011-12, pushing the current account deficit to a record $78.2 billion, 4.2% of the GDP, due to the rupee depreciation. This prompted the government to hike import duty on gold to 4% of the value in March 2012. Since then, gold imports have declined 37% to 131 tonne during April-June 2012, according to the WGC report. The consumer demand stood at 181.3 tonne for the second quarter of 2012, down 38% on a y-o-y basis. However, the assets under management of the 14 gold ETFs in India touched Rs 10,300 crore in May 2012, from Rs 5,463 crore a year ago. However, according to GFMS, the imports to India may fall 26% to 650-750 tonne in 2012.


				


Gold prices inched to an all-time high at just above $1,920 per ounce in September 2011 amid concerns about western economies. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has strengthened, adversely impacting the prices in global markets.

	 

doweshowbellyad = 0;

The yellow metal touched a low of $1,538 per ounce in May 2012 due to the sovereign debt crisis in the Euro-zone, and is currently trading at $1,690 per ounce. The prices have moved in a range with slight ups and downs. Presently, gold prices are tracking the global sentiment and moving in tandem with the riskier assets.


				


In August this year, after the US Federal Reserve Annual Symposium, and comments from the Fed chairman about the continuation of accommodative polices in the US, the metal surged to a five-month high of $1,693 per ounce.


				


The global demand is expected to strengthen in the future, triggered by the hope of monetary easing in the US, and positive outcome of the European Central Bank meeting on 6 September, which announced an unlimited bond buying program to fix Eurozone countries' borrowing costs. It could weaken the US dollar, increasing the investment in gold. On the domestic front, the demand will depend on the rupee depreciation and policy measures. The rain deficiency is likely to fall, driving gold demand in rural areas. It may also gain strength due to the festive/wedding season during October-December.

 The Mumbai-headquartered company had posted a net profit of Rs 208.58 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.
 
 The company, however, said its net profit for the quarter is not comparable due to out-licensing income of Rs 111.23 crore received in the corresponding quarter last year and also due to mark-to-market losses to the extent of Rs 55 crore recorded in the first quarter of 2012-13 fiscal, PTI reported.
 
 “However, the core net profit (excluding the out-licencing income and the forex loss/gain) jumped by 44.3 per cent YoY to Rs129.6 crore,” Sharekhan said in a report.

 In Q1FY2013 the net sales of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Glenmark) grew by 19.8 per cent year on year (YoY) to Rs 1,040.4 crore.
 
 “The specialty business includes the Indian formulation business, which grew by 24.1 per cent YoY during the quarter. Though the growth rate is better than the industry growth rate of 15%, it falls short of our expectation,” Sharekhan reported.
 
 The brokerage firm maintains a ‘buy’ recommendation on the counter with a target price of Rs 468 for a 12-month timeframe.
 
 The company posted revenues of Rs 392.35 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2012, mainly driven by generic business. The revenues stood at Rs 251.15 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal.
 
 Avinnash Gorakssakar, Founder Director, Moneyinvestments.in is positive on the pharma sector. Cipla and Glenmark Pharma are among his top bets.
 
 Although for Glenmark the price has moved up a bit, but with the kind of decline in their upfront payment, one can definitely buy the stock for long-term, he added.

Delisting buzz fuels Gillette stock surge,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/delisting-buzz-fuels-gillette-stock-surge/articleshow/28532466.cms,m.economictimes.com,Delisting buzz fuels Gillette stock surge,"The two companies, P&G and Gillette, have a long history of working in India under different names and different partners. 

 Gillette India was called Indian Shaving Products when it launched operations in India in 1984; Procter & Gamble did not exit India then, but Richardson Hindustan Ltd, the owner of the Vicks brand did. 

 P&G snapped up Richardson’s parent in a global acquisition in 1985 and entered India, adding the famous Vicks brand to its portfolio. Twenty years later in 2005, history seemed to repeat itself when P&G bought Gillette worldwide, becoming the owner of male grooming products such as shaving razors and creams. 

 For some time now, investors have been speculating about a possible open offer and delisting of Gillette India. The firm’s shares have jumped 10% in the past four days on high volumes on buzz that such an offer is imminent. Two bankers have apparently been appointed to do the process. 

 A P&G spokesperson, however said, ""This information is untrue."" According to grapevine, P&G may offer between Rs 2,800 and Rs 3,000 to minority shareholders."
Genpact Q1 net up 28% at $36 million,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/genpact-q1-net-up-28-at-36-million/articleshow/8173887.cms,m.economictimes.com,Genpact Q1 net up 28% at $36 million,"NEW DELHI: NYSE-listed BPO firm Genpact on Thursday upped its sales growth forecast for the year to 23% from 13% announced last quarter, buoyed by its recent acquisition of IT firm Headstrong and an improved market for outsourcing in the US. The BPO firm, which counts Wachovia, Wells Fargo and GE as top clients, posted a 28% rise in net profit to $36 million for the first quarter ended March 31. Sales of $331 million for the quarter also beat street expectations. Analysts were expecting sales of $326 million.
  
  
  ""Revenues from business process management services continue to be our growth engine,"" said Pramod Bhasin, Genpact's President and CEO. Revenue growth from GE, Genpact's largest client, almost remained flat at 0.7% from the same period last year. GE contributes about 34% to Genpact's sales.
  
  
  Genpact counts BPO firms WNS and EXL Service as its competitors, which have been on the block. Genpact on the other hand is trying to integrate IT services into its portfolio, to up its sales growth stagnated by flattish contribution from its largest client GE. Genpact's sales had grown 12% last year compared to the Indian BPO industry's growth of about 15%. 
  
  
  IT companies in India, however, grew about 27% last year. The company bought Noida-based IT firm Headstrong for $550 million last month, whose sales will be accounted for in next few quarters. Genpact will gain clients like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley with the buyout.
  
  
  Current revenues from IT services for Genpact were about 13% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2011. About 87% of Genpact's revenues for the quarter came from business process management services, up from 85% for the first quarter of 2010.
  
  
  An improved market for outsourcing has also led to rise in attrition for BPOs. Genpact's employee attrition rate for the quarter was 29%, up from 23% for the same period in 2010. As of March 31, 2011, Genpact had about 45,500 employees worldwide, an increase from 41,300 as of March 31, 2010. The firm's revenue per employee increased from $29,900 in the first quarter of 2010 to $30,700 in the quarter ending March this year. The $76-billion Indian IT-BPO industry is projected to grow about 18% this year."
Acquisitions double GCPL's topline,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/acquisitions-double-gcpls-topline/articleshow/6751120.cms,m.economictimes.com,Acquisitions double GCPL’s topline,"The stock of Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) rose by 3% in a weak broader market on Thursday after news of the merger of its fully owned subsidiary Godrej Household Products (GHPL) with itself. GCPL has a strong position in north India and GHPL is strong in the southern region. 
  
  The integration will help the company achieve economies of scale with higher cost synergies, better product portfolio and a stronger distribution network. 
  
  Godrej Household Products was initially a joint venture between Godrej Consumer Products and the US-based Sara Lee and Body Care. Recently, GCPL bought the 51% stake of Sara Lee and formed GHPL. 
  
  GHPL earns a major part of its revenue from home insecticides such as Good Knight and Hit. In FY10, GHPL had a total revenue of Rs 950 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 150 crore. Since GCPL earlier had only 49% stake in GHPL, it contributed a little less than 25% of the profits. 
  
  Post merger, the home insecticide business would roughly have a 40% share. Hence, the merger will help GCPL to reduce its dependence on soap products and also tackle high raw material cost caused by inflation in the soap segment.
  
  The timing of the acquisition, which took place in May-end just before the monsoons, may improve the topline of GCPL in the September quarter. According to a Tata Securities report, there is a very high correlation between monsoons and the insecticide industry. 
  
  Godrej Consumer’s net sales have more than doubled due to a series of acquisitions in the past. The company mainly operates in the personal wash, hair products and insecticides segments and aspires to grow big in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
  
  The recent acquisitions of Indonesia-based Megasarai, Africa-based Tura, and Latin America-based Issue and Argencos confirm the company’s ambition. In the past 3 months, GCPL’s stock price has increased by only 7.5% as against the 14.5% increase in the broader market Sensex. 
  
  At the current market price of Rs 401, the stock is trading at a consolidated price-earnings ratio of 33.2."

ET Now: The management of GCPL has just talked about a further improvement in the domestic market share. Is that the only trick available now?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: GCPL is not focused entirely on the domestic market.
 
 The FMCG company is insulated from the volume de-growth concerns that we have with other top FMCG companies.
 
 The company has taken a considerable time to establish itself in new geographies — the African and the South East Asian markets.
 
 It is placed second or at top slot in most of the segments that it is into. That is where you get pricing power. In such a scenario, a company like GCPL does not have to promote itself.
 
 Hence, the advertising and promotions (A&P) expenses come down significantly. In other words, selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) for the company is quite low.
 
 That is exactly what a higher market share helps you with. The cost of retaining market share should be too primitively high, which some of the domestic companies are dealing with. GCPL is surely one of the relatively undervalued stocks.
 
 You can anytime compare it with stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Britannia. That is why this stock attracts a lot of interest.

GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gail-to-benefit-most-from-rasgas-price-tweak/articleshow/49899602.cms,m.economictimes.com,GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,"ET Intelligence Group: Stocks of gas distributing companies including GAIL, Petronet LNG, Gujarat Gas, Indraprastha Gas and GSPL have risen by 13 per cent on average in a week now that renegotiation of gas prices with RasGas, a Qatar-based gas company, is turning from hope to reality. GAIL shot up 25 per cent making it the world’s best performing utility stock previous week since the company is expected to be a major beneficiary of such a renegotiation.
 
 There are three major changes in the renewed contract with RasGas, according to news reports. First, gas prices have been linked to three month average price of crude oil compared with a period of 12 months earlier. In addition to this, cap and floor have been removed from the gas pricing methodology. This means gas price will fall by half to $6-7/mmbtu from current level. Second, RasGas will postpone the recovery of liability of $1.5 billion of lesser offtake of 2015 and liability burden will be recovered in the next 13 years of remaining contract. The third factor is that the proportion of crude oil to compute gas price — in technical parlance known as slope — has been changed.
 
 Among Indian companies, GAIL will benefit on two counts. One, more gas will flow from its pipelines, which will accrue more transmission revenues. Second, lower raw material price for petrochemical division. Analysts reckon that every $1/mmbtu fall in gas price will lift GAIL’s Earning per share (EPS) for the next year by Re 1. This means price fall of $5/mmbtu will add another Rs 560 crore profitability for the GAIL.
 
 

 
 Petronet LNG will benefit since there will be no liability of $1.5 billion emerging from take or pay (ToP) clause and gradually longterm volume will move to normal level thus, lifting the utilisation of the Dahej terminal.
 
 Apart from these, gas distributors such as IGL, Gujarat Gas could also gain on the RasGas contract as this gas constitutes 10-15 per cent of their gas mix and cater to their industrial customers. Pure transporters like GSPL, while not direct beneficiaries, as they were not meaningfully impacted in the first place, could be indirect longer-term gainers as any renegotiation is a tacit acknowledgement of the LNG market having structurally changed, which should benefit importing countries like India."
Rajesh Subramaniam helped Firstsource execute a perfect turnaround,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rajesh-subramaniam-helped-firstsource-execute-a-perfect-turnaround/articleshow/28608376.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rajesh Subramaniam helped Firstsource execute a perfect turnaround,"Firstsource, one of the India's top three business process outsourcing companies, has been through hell and back. Investors, bondholders, lenders and even its employees had given up on the company in 2011: its stock had crashed to a mere Rs 10 in 2011 from Rs 70 in 2008, the company was grappling with rising debt, and facing an outstanding FCCB payment. It had no earnings to get out of this mess.

It was when Rajesh Subramaniam, who had resigned from Firstsource in 2008, was asked to come back and rescue the ship. In August 2012, Subramaniam was appointed the managing director and CEO, and since then, he has scripted an almost perfect turnaround story. Subramaniam helped the company repay debt and FCCB, consolidated facilities, broke operational silos, realigned sales functions, renegotiated unviable client agreements, and rationalise cost.

""Few months after I rejoined, we realised the magnitude of breakdown in internal governance. A lot of things had collapsed and all our stake holders had lost confidence,"" recalls Subramaniam.

""We reassessed all the assets and systems and came out with a viable option to bring Firstsource back on track,"" he said. This included realigning the processes, rationalising employee structure and renegotiating with all the clients.

Twelve months down the line, Firstsource had a new life - and a new promoter: RPG Group's Sanjiv Goenka acquired Firstsource in 2012. There were others who were interested. Vedanta Group CFO Tarun Jain and Rakesh Jhunjunwala, known as India's Warren Buffett, put in money.

Using the cash from preference allotment to promoters and other internal accruals, the company was able to pay back $237 million, or Rs 1,300 crore, FCCB in 2012. Then the company undertook various restructuring exercises: it weeded out non-profitable customers - mostly Indian clients with low margins - and identified areas of growth, especially the healthcare industry in the US.

Under the new leadership, Firstsource's profit after tax more than doubled to Rs 146 crore in FY13 from Rs 62 crore a year ago, and the stock has more than trebled to Rs 24 at present from its low of Rs 8 in 2011. The debt has also halved to Rs 1,000 crore.

But the best is yet to come, according to the new chief. ""Last year we emerged, this year we will consolidate, and next year we will start growing,"" said Subramaniam.

	 
""In the current fiscal, the company is expecting a profit after tax of over Rs 180 crore. In the next fiscal, we will grow by at least 12-15%, our operating margins will also increase by another 200 basis points and our net debt will be less than $80 million, or Rs 500 crore,"" he said.

This seems feasible given the company's focus on healthcare and insurance sectors, which account for almost 35-40% of its revenues. ObamaCare, as it is popularly known, mandates that its citizens buy health insurance in 2014 or else face penalty. This could bring 30 million Americans into the insurance net, and implies incremental volumes for both hospitals and insurers. ""We are very excited about this and are expecting a growth of over 15% in our healthcare business process outsourcing,"" said Subramaniam.

Although the company's stock has run up by over 100% in the past year, it is still trading at an attractive valuation. It is trading at FY14 price-to-earnings multiple of 9 and FY15 P/E multiple of 6.5, which is quite cheap compared with other IT peers which are trading at multiples of over 10.

""FSL continues to be an attractive story for value investors given the debt repayment roadmap, which itself could translate into market-cap gains,"" said Abhishek Shindadkar, IT analyst with ICICI Direct. ""Going by the current rate, the company will end FY16 with a net cash of at least Rs 300 crore,"" he added."

Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/facebook-rally-has-analysts-gasping-for-breath/articleshow/31859756.cms,m.economictimes.com,Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,"By Sarah Frier
 
 SAN FRANCISCO: Wall Street analysts are racing to keep up with Facebook’s stock rally. Shares of the world’s biggest social network have jumped 32% so far this year, compared with a 1.6% gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The surge has left the 49 analysts who cover Facebook in a bind -- while 38 of them recommend the company with the equivalent of a buy rating, 21 of the total now have share-price targets below where Facebook is trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That translates into an average 12-month price target of $72.46 for Facebook, less than 1% above the company’s closing price of $72.03 on Monday. 

 With the stock advancing more rapidly than anticipated, the price targets -- many of which were calculated in 2014, with several dating back to last year - - would suggest that analysts on average see little upside to the stock. That may force some of the bulls to adjust their projections, with two analysts boosting their price forecasts on Monday. 

 “Facebook stock has just ripped past expectations,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG in New York, who in October recommended buying the shares with a $68 target over the next 12 months. At the time, Facebook was trading at $49. “We’re very happy with our rating upgrade to buy, but it has all happened super fast,” he said. 

 
FACEBOOK’S TURNABOUT 

 In Germantrading on Tuesday, the stock rose less than 1% to the equivalent of $72.52 at 10:58 a.m. in Frankfurt. Facebook’s stock surge underscores how the company’s prospects have improved following its rocky stock-market debut in May 2012. 

 Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg weathered a 50% drop in the company’s stock price in the months after its initial public offering at $38, as investors questioned whether Facebook could come up with a mobile strategy with users increasingly accessing the social network from smartphones and tablets. Since then, Facebook has pushedinto mobile advertising. In January, it reported quarterly results that beat estimates, with more than half of ad revenue coming from mobile devices. Last month, Facebook ramped up its mobile business by agreeing to purchase WhatsApp for as much as $19 billion in cash and stock, betting on the mobile-messaging startup’s large international user base to accelerate growth. 

 
UNANIMOUS ANALYSIS 

 While it isn’t unheard of for a company to trade above its average analyst price target Facebook stands out because of how analysts almost unanimously agree their clients should buy the stock."

 The stock rose 12.72 per cent to hit a high of Rs 4.43 on the BSE. 

 The steelmaker, in a regulatory filing to BSE, said that board members have “considered and taken on record SDR package approved by Joint Llenders’ Forum pursuant to RBI circular dated June 8 for conversion of part of debt aggregating to Rs 2,507 crore into 250.75 crore equity shares of the company of Rs. 10 each.” 

 According to the company's FY15 annual report, the company’s total debt was in excess of Rs 10,000 crore as of March 31, 2015. 

 In the September quarter results, the company had informed exchanges that due to continuous losses and excess of current liabilities over current assets, its net worth had fallen by around 50 per cent. 

 The company reported a net loss of Rs 624 crore for FY15. Net loss for the H1FY16 stood at Rs 389 crore.

  This is strictly a short term trading recommendation because the stock’s long term trend is down. This is not a portfolio stock at all but it has got a built up a bit of momentum in the last two weeks or so and should the market hold out, this is a nice volatile stock which can deliver on the upside as well. This has been the prime reason for picking it. So if the stock is bought, do not look beyond week maximum for holding this stock.

Mayuresh Joshi: Their numbers are more or less in line with what the street was expecting. A couple of points that probably worked in favour of Dish was that the content costs were probably contained at around 90 to 100 odd crores and again looking at the kind of digitisation processes that are probably going through, though they have probably got extended for this fiscal, the take probably is that with MSOs probably hiking rates, players like Dish have some amount of leverage at least in terms of subscription additions and they have done a pretty good job.

Defence-related stocks rally on Indo-US nuclear deal,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/defence-related-stocks-rally-on-indo-us-nuclear-deal/articleshow/46026326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Defence-related stocks rally on Indo-US nuclear deal,"MUMBAI: Shares of companies related to defence sector gained momentum in trade following a ‘breakthrough’ between India and the US over civilian nuclear pact.
 
 As per the deal details, India will set up an insurance pool led by General Insurance Co and four other insurance companies of a total amount of Rs 750 crore to indemnify companies that build reactors in the country against liabilities in case of a nuclear accident.
 
 The remaining Rs 750 crore of the total Rs 1,500 crore to offset liabilities will be provided by the government of India. This will address US concerns over clause 17 of the Indian liability Act.
 
 ""We are happy to know that an agreement has been announced between the Indian & US governments on the contentious issue of Civil Nuclear Liability. Although details would need to be studied, I feel confident that, given the strong emphasis placed by our government on ""Make in India"", the interests of all stakeholders, including domestic industries which have been steadfastly supporting India's own nuclear program, will be adequately addressed,” said MV Kotwal, Whole Time Director & President Heavy Engineering, Larsen & Toubro.
 
 The two countries will also kickstart joint production on four defense products that will be beneficial for Indian companies, say reports.
 
 According to Rajiv Memani, CEO, Ernst & Young, it is a breakthrough moment and a positive development.
 
 “Joint production of defence deals group promotes the theme of Made in India, speed up decision making process,” he told ET Now.
 
 It took six years for a breakthrough after a bilateral agreement was signed between the two countries.
 
 “We are moving towards commercial cooperation, consistent with our laws (and) international legal obligations,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the press conference.
 
 The Indian and the US companies are yet study finer details of the deal.
 
 “The details remained vague, and it was unclear whether the understanding would convince American companies, such as General Electric Co. and Westinghouse, to invest in India's civilian nuclear development,” reported Peter Baker and Ellen Barry of The New York Times.
 
 At 
10:00 a.m.; Bharat Electronics was up 6.92 per cent, L&T gained 2.40 per cent, Astra Microwave moved up 3.03 per cent, Alstom India advanced 6.38 per cent and Siemens rose 1.32 per cent."
Deepak Fertilisers bets on chemicals to deliver growth,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/deepak-fertilisers-bets-on-chemicals-to-deliver-growth/articleshow/30300794.cms,m.economictimes.com,Deepak Fertilisers bets on chemicals to deliver growth,"Deepak Fertilisers & Petrochemicals (DFPCL), a leading manufacturer of ammonium nitrate - an industrial explosive as well as a fertiliser used in agriculture - is set to benefit from the government's regulations on production, trade and imports of the chemical. The company more than doubled its capacity of ammonium nitrate in FY14, and is expanding other businesses as well.
 
 In 2012, the government had introduced ammonium nitrate rules to regulate production, transportation and warehousing of this material, when it became apparent that some people were using it for harmful purposes. The regulations became applicable from January 2014, mandating KYC norms for customers as well as transporters, numbered bagging and GPS-enabled transportation, among other things.
 
 ""The new rules are expected to increase the cost of import since ammonium nitrate is required to be imported in bagged condition,"" said Shailesh Mehta, the company's chairman and managing director. It commissioned 300,000-tonne capacity in FY14 to take its total capacity to 470,000 tonne, when India's annual consumption of technical ammonium nitrate (TAN) stands at around 700,000 tonne, growing at 7-8%.
 
 

 
 The company recorded a 33% jump in its TAN volumes in the first nine months of FY14, which emerged as the single-largest revenue earner for the company at nearly 25% of total revenues.
 
 ""Our TAN capacity utilisation stands at around 60% at present, which will go up to 80-90% in FY15,"" said Somnath Patil, president and chief financial officer of the company.
 
 The company's other specialty chemical Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), a solvent used in pharma and paint industries, has also come up well contributing 20% to the company's total turnover. This unit is already working at 100% capacity utilisation at its 70,000-tonne plant.
 
 ""The IPA requirement in the domestic market is increasing by around 6-7% from the present level of 1,10,000 tonne. Therefore, another similar plant will be needed to serve domestic requirement. We are evaluating various options for increasing capacity,"" said Mehta.
 
 Thanks to these two chemicals, in addition to nitric acid and methanol, the company's industrial chemicals segment has emerged a faster growing business with better margins, compared with the fertiliser.
 
 The company is also investing in agri-inputs business. ""We are expanding fertiliser capacity at Taloja from the existing 2.29 lakh tonne to 6-lakh tonne. This will also allow us to produce different grades of complex fertilisers as well as fortified fertilisers,"" said Mehta.
 
 There are two main concerns ahead for the company. First, the likely increase in natural gas prices from April ’14 will need raising retail prices of the fertilisers it sells, which may hamper volume growth in the short term. Second, its real estate project — a specialty mall in Pune named Ishanya — is losing money. The company is working on its turnaround, but with little success so far.
 
 Notwithstanding these worries, the company’s FY15 numbers will be significantly better than the current year. This visibility on recovery and inexpensive valuations are making the company attractive to investors. Six out of eight brokerage houses tracking the company hold a ‘Buy’ recommendation, according to Bloomberg data.
 
 “Deepak is currently trading at 4.7 times its expected FY15 earnings, which is at a discount of 30% to its long-term average,” said a report from brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher. “Dividend yield of 5% prevents further downside risk,” it added. Investors will do well to stay with the company."

  Dabur, which sells personal care and healthcare products under brands like Dabur and Vatika, had a sales of Rs 4,110 crore. Around 22 per cent of the company's sales come from international operations. 
  
  ""In the current year we expect 28 per cent of sales coming from the overseas as the benefit of our recent acquisitions will start kicking in,"" Duggal said. 
  
  In September, 2010, the company had completed acquisition of Turkish personal care firm Hobi Kozmetik Group for USD 69 million (about Rs 324 crore) to strengthen its presence in West Asia and North Africa. 
  
  Dabur is expecting that in three years' time, international operations will contribute around 35 per cent to its overall sales, he added."

  We have told all our corporate customers that you must give me my share of CASA by opening salary account of your employees in my bank,” said Mr Pradeep. “We are only saying that employees of at least one division or one unit of the company should have salary account with us.

Capgemini raises 2015 revenue outlook on Igate acquisition,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/capgemini-raises-2015-revenue-outlook-on-igate-acquisition/articleshow/48279729.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Capgemini raises 2015 revenue outlook on Igate acquisition,"MUMBAI: Capgemini said its revenue in the first half jumped 9.9% and the French IT firm raised its full-year revenue and margin guidance to account for its acquisition of Igate, and said a detailed blueprint for the integration would be available by the end of September. 

 Capgemini said first-half revenue grew by nearly a tenth to 5.6 billion euros. Organically, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and the consolidation of Euriware, the company reported revenue growth of 1.4%. Capgemini’s acquisition of Igate closed on July 1, and is not included in the results. Capgemini also forecast 2015 revenue growth of 12%, at current group structure and exchange rates, and an operating margin rate of 10.3%. 

 “The combined evolution of our geographic mix and our portfolio of offerings towards high value-added segments enables us to further improve our profitability and gain market share. The IGATE integration process is now underway which together with the accelerated development of our Digital business, will be the Group’s priority for the coming period,” Paul Hermelin, chairman and chief executive officer of Capgemini Group, said in a statement. 

 Capgemini now has 178,500 employees, including 96,000 in its global delivery centers, most of which are in India. 

 “Experienced good growth in North America and we see good growth in emerging markets. Europe is less active, so that’s pretty good,” Hermelin said in a video available on the company’s investor relations side. Hermelin also addressed the company’s integration with Igate. 

 “I just chaired a meeting with 80 people from both companies and they are very excited. We have to work as one company by January, so there will be a detailed blueprint made by end of September,” he added."

So right now it is very prudent to stick to these kind of defensive sectors mainly being healthcare and we have recommend a buy on Biocon only above 407 for a target of 417 and keeping a stop loss of approximately 402, so definitely a good buy but only above 407."

 There was a time when anything which had software in its name did very well 1999-2000 and then in 2003-2004 where anything which had infrastructure in its name did extremely well - whether or not they had something to do with infrastructure. 

 “This is the age of Bharat and everything that appears to have Bharat in its name is doing extremely well and chances are that they will keep on doing well,” said Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com. 

 “There is one investing principle that investors could use - anything that doubles once chances are that it will double again and again and again that is the power of compounding,” he added. 

 Most of the stocks which have 'Bharat' in their name are government-owned companies which are already trading way below their respective peak valuations. 

 However, most of these stocks have doubled in the last three months on the prospects of pro-growth reforms from the new government to kick start investment cycle and boost growth in Asia’s third largest economy. 

 Another reason highlighted by analysts is that most of these companies have fallen out of favour in the last decade due to unfavourable government policies. 

 PSUs mcap has shrunk to 20 per cent of BSE 100 at present compared with 32 per cent in March 2005. Lower proportion of mcap offers significant room to investors to increase exposure and secure risk-reward ratio, ET reported. 

 “If government can take hard decisions, then the Indian growth story is here to stay and most stocks under the name Bharat may very well outperform benchmark indices,” said A K Prabhakar, Independent Market Expert. 

 “Most of the Bharat stocks are PSUs other than BHARAT FORGE and have the potential to become multibaggers from current levels,” he added.

The net profit soared to Rs 34.39 crore in Q4 of CY10 as compared to Rs 25.40 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The net sales of the company has shown a 23.5% growth to Rs 355.85 crore as compared to Rs 288.09 crore in Q4 of CY09. 
  
  At 9:45 am, shares of the company were trading 1.03% up at Rs 352.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The profit-before-tax (PBT) of the company in Q4 of CY10 has gone up by 42.6% to Rs 142.99 crore against Rs 100.26 crore in the same period last year. 
  
  For the entire CY10, Bata India’s net profit has soared to Rs 95.35 crore — growth of 41.84% over the previous year. The net sales of the company in CY10 went up by 14.41% to Rs 1,256.85 crore from Rs 1,090.17 crore in CY09. 
  
  Bata India attributes this growth to the new retail strategy adopted by the company. Bata India Group Managing Director Marcelo Villagran said: “During 2010, we opened 108 stores, each with an area of more than 3,000 sq ft. With separate defined sections, offering hundreds of designs for men, ladies, children and youth, the new Bata stores offer a whole new experience to consumers. Made as per Bata's global design, the new stores use the latest retail designs and best quality furniture that enhance the store's layout and provide for an attractive product display.”"
Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/restructuring-helps-bata-india-stay-a-step-ahead/articleshow/7566695.cms,m.economictimes.com,Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,"Bata India's business-model restructuring appears to be paying off well. For the year 2010, the company clocked a growth of 42% in its standalone earnings while net sales grew by 15%. 
  
  Brand repositioning and operational restructuring were the two key areas at the heart of the revamping exercise. The company introduced and expanded high-margin premium brands such as Hush Puppies, North Star and Weinbrenner. It also optimised its chain of retail outlets by opening large-format stores, closing down the less profitable ones and renovating the rest. 
  
  On the operational front, the company began outsourcing the production of its low-cost merchandise. The key benefit of this move was a steady reduction in the overall raw material cost to 46.1% of net sales in 2010 from 48.1% three years ago. Besides, it also brought down staff costs to 13.9% of sales from 20.6% during the same period. The company is expanding its retail outlets network to enhance market reach. In 2010, it opened 108 stores, taking the total count to 1,300. It plans to open 50-60 stores in tier-II and tier-III cities annually to increase market penetration. It has also launched new complementary services such as online shopping and Bata Home Delivery service. 
  
  The benefits of these steps are already visible in the company's operating profit margins, which has improved from 8.6% in 2007 to 14% in 2010. The December quarter proved to be the best of the year, with the company clocking a year-on-year net sales growth of 23% compared with the average 11.3% year-on-year growth for the first three quarters. The operating margin for the quarter at 17.3% was also the highest; for the first three quarters, the average was 12.7%. 
  
  The company is also trying to become an approved supplier to the armed forces. It has acquired technology from its parent company to make shoes as required by the defence personnel. The demand from the domestic defence forces alone stands at 1.2 million pairs every year; if it is approved as a supplier, Bata's earnings would get a substantial boost. Another revenue booster will be development of its 260-acre land in Batanagar, near Kolkata, in a 50:50 joint venture with the Calcutta Metropolitan Group. Bata India has deployed around 73 crore since 2007 for setting up a township; the first phase is expected to be commissioned some time later in 2011. The township is expected to be completed by 2013. 
  
  Given the company's growth, the current price-to-earning multiple of 23 does not seem high."

  All these commodity related stories, steel, aluminium, copper, they are all running up this afternoon. How are you reading into the news, what do you make of it? 
  
  With China making the currency flexible, the sense that we are getting is that there would be more purchasing power and with the economy doing well, there would be more demand for base metal. So steel, copper, we will see these base metal prices going up. 
  
  If you look at Sesa Goa particularly, one of the Japanese steel manufactures have increased the purchase price by 23%, most of these companies now work on quarterly contracts. So that augurs well for Sesa Goa. Having said that with China making its currency flexible, we will see lot of liquidity flows happening in the emerging market and we expect the US dollar to depreciate between 3% to 5% in next 3 to 6 months’ time."

 People first started talking seriously about the potential for Apple to become a trillion dollar company in February when shares reached news highs. The current stock price of $127 a share gives the company a valuation of $744 billion. Cantor analyst Brian White currently has the highest price target on Wall Street. 

 It's not just the launch of the Apple Watch that has White so bullish. He's also optimistic about Apple's iPhone portfolio in China, which he says is poised to benefit from a new upgrade cycle following the expanding 4G network, as well as potential new areas of interest such as an electric car. To top that off, he believes Apple will continue to return cash to shareholders, with more coming next month. 

 ""We believe the combination of these forces will drive the market to reward Apple's stock with an expanded P/E multiple, and we are raising our 12-month price target to $180 (~$1T cap; from $160).""

Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/capacity-addition-to-help-apl-apollo/articleshow/6695006.cms,m.economictimes.com,Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,"Stock of APL Apollo Tubes, a Delhi-based steel tube manufacturer, has consistently outperformed the markets with yearly returns of 160% compared to a 20% rise in Sensex. The company’s recently commissioned capacities and the planned acquisition of Lloyds Line Pipes is set to give a booster to its earnings in the coming quarters.
  
  Incorporated in 1986, APL Apollo Tubes is a manufacturer and exporter of steel pipes and tubes. It produces a wide range of steel tubes including black tubes, galvanised tubes, pre-galvanised tubes and hollow sections.
  
  The company doubled its production capacity to 4 lakh tonnes per annum by adding a new plant in Hosur. The plant, which was under trial runs till July, will make its presence felt from the September quarter. The new plant will cater to the growing demand from South India.
  
  The company has also forged a strategic partnership with a leading distributor, Shankara Pipes, under which the company will allot around 2% of its equity shares on preferential basis to the latter at `176 each. This is at around 11% premium to its current market price. The relationship is expected to help in increasing the company’s presence in southern and western markets.
  
  At present, the exports account for only about 5% of APL Apollo’s revenue, which the copmany wants to increase going forward.
  
  The recently-announced acquisition of the Maharashtra-based manufacturer of steel tubes and pipes Lloyds Line Pipes for `40 crore, which will be completed later this year, will boost the capacity by 90,000 tonne per annum besides improving access to customers in the Western region.
  
  The company reported net sales growth of 19% y-o-y in the June 2010 quarter. The company, however, saw its profit declining 18% due to presence of other income in the last year’s profit. As the company operates with low operating margins, it depends on volume to boost its profits.
  
  At the current market price of `158 the stock is trading at 15 times to trailing 12-month EPS. This is to a premium to most of its peers. However, considering its recently doubled capacities, the premium appears justified."

Profits were driven by a rise in business, coupled with an improvement in margin. Bank chairman JP Dua attributed the rise to improvement in income from core business.
   
  The bank which saw its total business touch Rs 1.96 lakh crore, aims to cross Rs 2 lakh crore by December and Rs 2.20 lakh crore by March next year, Mr Dua said. The bank’s net interest margin increased to 3.34% for the September quarter compared with 3.10% in the previous quarter. At the start of the fiscal, we announced that we would like to keep NIM over 3%. So far, we have maintained this target, Mr Dua said. 
  
  The Kolkata-based bank’s operating profit for the period rose 20% at Rs 782 crore from Rs 650 crore in the corresponding period in 2009. Total income rose 22% to Rs 2,982 crore against Rs 2,452 crore. It made a provision of Rs 379 crore towards non-performing assets, income tax and others. 
  
  Mr Dua said the bank had to make a whopping Rs 220 crore of provision only towards NPAs on account of agriculture debt relief scheme. The scheme expired on June this year but a significant chunk of farmers did not avail of the benefit, making them defaulters of bank loans. 
  
  Gross NPA ratio deteriorated to 1.77% as on September 2010 from 1.5% three months ago. Net NPAs deteriorated to 0.56% from 0.41% due to rising incidents of defaults in the farm sector. The bank is adequately capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.49%. Yet, it has headroom of Rs 2,600 crore to raise capital."

Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/catch-up-game-bse-mid-cap-index-trails-bigger-peers/articleshow/32635789.cms,m.economictimes.com,Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,"The BSE mid-cap index, which rallied in tandem with the benchmark indices in 2007 to touch an all-time high, has under-performed over the last 18 months as projected earnings growth at the start of FY14 was much lower when calculated on an annualised basis. The projected earnings growth for the BSE mid-cap index in April 2013 was over 25%, which has now been lowered down to 16per cent. Though the benchmark indices are trading at an all-time high, the BSE mid-cap is trading 33per cent away from the lifetime peak it scaled in 2007.
 
 Over the last one year, the BSE mid-cap index has been under-performing the Nifty as most of its constituents have witnessed a gradual downward revision in earnings. The majority of constituents or companies which constitute the BSE mid-cap index have seen a downward revision, as most brokerages had pinned hopes of a recovery in growth from the third quarter of FY14. The brokerages have built in a profit contribution of over 55-60per cent in the second half of FY14, but with little changes in the macro environment and muted demand, they were bound to revise their earnings downward.
 
 According to Bloomberg, the mid-cap index EPS for FY14 has fallen by 20per cent to 485 since September last year. On the other hand, the Nifty’s EPS for FY14 has been upgraded by 9per cent to 452 during the same period. Of the 216 constituents of the BSE mid-cap, only 32 stocks have seen an upward revision of EPS since September 2013.
 
 On the valuation front, the BSE Mid-cap Index is trading at a lower valuation compared with the Nifty. The difference of P/E (price-earning) multiple of two indices, which is known as PE spread shows the amount of premium or discount an investor is willing to pay to buy for a higher risk mid-cap stock.
 
 If the PE spread is lower than the historical average, it indicates that investors are not overtly bullish about the mid-cap stocks compared to benchmark indices with limited prospects for a build-up in the stock. In 2007, on a historical basis, the BSE mid-cap PE (price-earnings) was trading at a premium valuation to the Nifty. The BSE Mid-cap was trading at 23 times in November 2007 when the Nifty traded at 21 times.
 
 Among the constituents of the BSE Midcap, companies whose EPS has been revised upwards, have seen a significant gain since the start of the year. Even the interest of institutional investors such as foreign institutional investors and also mutual funds had been largely concentrated on companies of the BSE midcap constituents where they perceive a fair amount of revenue visibility and see an upward revision in EPS. That is why midcap stocks that rallied recently were the ones whose EPS were upgraded by analysts.
 
 Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Bharat Forge and IPCA have seen a consistent increase in FII holding during the last three quarters. From the start of the year, the BSE mid-cap gained 434 points, of which 80per cent of the contribution came from stocks such as Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, MRF, IPCA, and TVS Motors. Among these, Aurobindo Pharma received the highest EPS upgradation of 23per cent due to which its stock appreciated by 36per cent. Besides this, Apollo Tyres’ stock gained 34per cent as its EPS was upgraded by 21per cent."

 New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, was up nine cents at $95.81 in mid-morning trade while Brent North Sea crude for March gained 26 cents at $106.95. 

 WTI sank 92 cents in New York trade Monday while Brent fell $1.19 in London, tracking heavy losses in global equity markets spurred by weak corporate earnings and uncertainty in emerging economies. 

 Financial markets have also been shaken by data last week indicating manufacturing activity in China -- the world's top energy consumer and a key driver of global growth -- had contracted in January. 

 ""Markets remain skittish and the mood is somewhat cautious as the focus remains on emerging market travails,"" French lender Credit Agricole said in a note. 

 ""The current bout of pressure may yet be contained but there is still some way to go before market stress is alleviated,"" it said. 

 Kelly Teoh, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said investors were also keenly awaiting the outcome of a two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled to end tomorrow. 

 The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to decide on a further $10 billion reduction in its monthly asset purchases, to $65 billion. 

 In December, the FOMC said it would begin tapering the stimulus by $10 billion to $75 billion a month in January. 

 The so-called tapering of the Fed's asset purchases would likely boost the greenback, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for countries using other currencies, dampening demand."

ET Now: Last hour strategies for the last trading session of this year, what is the call? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: On the index, we still have not changed our stance. But given the fact that we are getting close to the upper end of the range which is around 8300, there is a good chance that we might see some momentum come. In that case we may close above levels of 8300. Lot of individual stocks, specific names are breaking out and giving nice movement. The breadth is about 2.5 is to 1. That is a very positive side. So the chances are that if not today, maybe in the next one-two days, we might get a breakout above 8300. That could possibly suggest further upside in the Nifty in the short term."

 NSE Nifty futures' open interest has been on a decline since March 3, but Bank Nifty futures' aggregate OI remained positive during the same period.Meanwhile, SGX Nifty futures' aggregate open interest remains near the year's peak touched February 26.
 
 Total F&O turnover in Indian exchanges continues to rise after March derivative series became active. Bulk of the action is witnessed in index call options, which are probably seeing unwinding after Nifty hit a peak on March 4. This reasoning is also supported by the rise in the PC ratio of index open interest. It has been on a rise lately, but is still below a year's average.
 PC ratio of stocks' OI is also below average, and there is hardly any stock active in the F&O segment with PC ratio above 1. It is possible that the recent price falls in stocks may have attracted more interest in calls, but such a bias increases the risk of magnifying falls if stocks were to slide further. 

 Meanwhile, FII net equity investment remained positive since February 16. However, the combined trade volume of cash segment in NSE & BSE has remained below a year's average for over two weeks now, suggesting that traders in the equity segment are looking for fresh cues after Budget announcement. 

 India VIX, an indicator of volatility based on the Nifty index option prices is at 17.38, and has been easing since February derivatives' expiry. Open interest distribution across the put-call spectrum of Nifty hints at 8600-9000 as the region that traders have estimated the price moves to be in, in the event of a rise in volatility."
Hold on to IT stocks: Deven Choksey,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/deven-choksey-on-2-stocks-that-can-emerge-multibaggers-in-next-5-years/articleshow/92974035.cms,m.economictimes.com,Deven Choksey on 2 stocks that can emerge as multibaggers in next 5 years,"“In every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money,” says Deven Choksey, MD, KRChoksey Holdings Pvt. Ltd. 

We saw a smart 2% upmove on the Bank Nifty and the IndusInd Bank counter was high by 4.5% yesterday. Kotak Bank was high by almost 3.5% in trade. Has the time for banks finally arrived? We are talking about the capex cycle which can also be played.I guess the time cannot be better than this, wherein it reassures us that the economy is progressing well. Banks are progressing as far as lending is concerned. Up till now, private banks have been concentrating on the retail side of the book, which they continue to do but in the last quarter and a little earlier, from January to March till now and from April to June quarter, systematically the corporate lending side of the book has started increasing.
 
The growth rate in that particular area has also increased. In my view, the corporate credit offtake is taking place at this point of time and no wonder because on one hand, the infrastructure-led spending is happening in the economy and PLI schemes are outside the interactive new investment into the economy. At the same time, most of the companies are getting ready for the next phase of growth – call it Brownfield or Greenfield expansion.
 
All in all, put together, the bank’s credit requirement is on the higher side. At the same time, with the rise in commodity prices, the requirement for working capital has started increasing for most of the corporates and they are again asking banks to fund them. As a result, we had seen the credit offtake. So maybe, the results should reflect into what you call companies earnings in subsequent quarters but the lending activity starts now, the sanctioning of the loans starts now and should this particular thing continue, we are going to see the next two to four quarters reflecting the earnings.
 
With a higher amount of growth, and that is where I would argue that some of the larger banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI, need to be considered for the portfolio largely because of the fact that the sheer size is slowing. At the same time, the business condition is improving and these banks remained very disciplined during the pandemic period and did not expand their book, Now they are getting an opportunity to expand their book size with the kind of alpha payment side, I think it is a better time to buy as far as the timing is concerned in the market.
 

Why do you enjoy this reputation that you are never bearish? It is very difficult to find a sell idea from Deven Choksey? We were definitely bullish in every condition because in my career span of more than three decades, at every stage, this market has seen higher amount of growth, whatever the situation in the economy has been. I have done some eight year cycle analysis and I think in every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money. 
 
So I remain bullish of course for the India economy and its growth. Also, we are now probably into the $5-trillion zone, sooner than later and in such a situation, we need to remain bullish because the market cap is likely to double from current levels. All in all, put together, if one wants to make money from the stock market, it is always good to remain an optimist. But things can go wrong even after remaining optimistic.

 

If I have to put a graphic which says Deven’s multibagger idea or ideas for this decade – stocks which can make a lot of wealth in five, six years – which will be those one, two, three names?There are a couple of stocks where I probably keep my focus on currently. I feel HDFC, HDFC Life as a combination is triggering a Rs 50 lakh- crore AUM company. In the next four and a half to five years, should they continue with a growth rate of around 20% odd in the housing finance portfolio, the possibility of continuing with this kind of a growth rate is very high.
 
In retail also, the growth rate on a larger base of AUM will continue to be very high. In the corporate sector, they would be more cautious but I would still think that around 15-16% kind of a growth rate is definitely possible on a larger base. Should this particular portfolio of lending continue to grow at this pace, then on a Rs 50 lakh crore size balance sheet, somewhere in 4.5-5 years time from now, I think this combination could give a nice reward. Even if you compound the return at 25%, you will get a reasonably good amount of appreciation in a four to five years’ time frame. So this is one company which is probably right to buy into. 
 
The second stock where we believe the opportunity is emerging stronger is going to be L&T Technology Services. I would think that beyond the kind of engineering services that they have, coupled with IT and the way the economy is growing and the investment space, would demand higher IT usage after even 5G comes in. This is going to be more of a trusted space. This company is a niche player like Tata Elxsi in the engineering-based IT solutions and that is where I believe that staying with this company for four, five years could give multi bagger returns, something that we have experienced in the case of Tata Elxsi."
Nine banks keen on Hind Copper FPO mandate,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/nine-banks-keen-on-hind-copper-fpo-mandate/articleshow/6091097.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nine banks keen on Hind Copper FPO mandate,"BANGALORE: Hindustan Copper’s chairman and managing director Shakeel Ahmed said on Thursday that nine investment banks have shown interest in managing the firm’s follow-on public offer (FPO). He added that the company will finalise the names before the end of the month. “We are planning our FPO in September or October this year.” 
  
  “Nine banks, including DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak, ICICI Securities, SBI Capital Markets, IDBI, UBS, IDFC-SSKI besides Avendus Capital and Enam, are keen to participate in our fund-raising exercise,” he said. Mr Ahmed clarified that while the FPO will see the company dilute only 20% of its equity, the balance 5-6% will be done subsequently to meet the new minimum public shareholding norm of 25%. Currently a minuscule 0.41% of the company’s equity is traded on the bourses. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said the company was planning to raise funds to partially finance its Rs 4,580- crore capex plans. This investment, which will be done over the next 5-6 years, will see close to 70% funds being raised through equity dilution, the balance being debt and internal accruals. 
  
  The capex will see HCL hiking production capacity at its Khetri (Rajasthan) plant to 3.1 mt from 1 mt. Similarly, the Malanjikhand (Jharkhand) plant’s capacity will rise to 5 mt from the current 2 mt. The Ghatsila (Jharkhand) unit’s new capacity will be 3.9 mt from 0.4-0.6 mt. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said that HCL will expand copper exploration and mining activity as copper consumption has risen due to rapid economic growth. “India’s current consumption is only 5.5 lakh tonne and we lag behind China and the US, which consume 61 lakh tonne and 19 lakh tonne respectively,” he added. He said that the Rajasthan government had recommended the firm’s name for copper mining at Bannivaliki Dhani. HCL was scouting for mines in Chile and Namibia. 
  
  “These are still at a nascent stage. There are a lot of regulatory issues like ownership pattern of the venture, mining rights and the like,” he added. Mr Ahmed said that the company had begun a dialogue with Karnataka’s Hutti Gold Mines to revive the copper mines at Chitradurga. 
  
  “HCL could look at a joint-venture or outright purchase or a supply contract from this mine, which has reserves of nearly 2 mt, and closed in 2001 as global copper prices fell to $ 2,500 per tonne,” he added. HCL shares inched up 0.49% to Rs 495.3 on Thursday."

Gaurang Shah: We have recently come out with overall view on the banking and NBFC segment and wherein we have upgraded the targets for most of the private sector banks and HDFC is one of them.  A target stand at about close to 800-820 and our belief is that the performance that we have seen over the last couple of quarters has been quite consistent though there has been a slight bit of deterioration.  Given the way both HDFC and HDFC Bank has created value for an individual portfolio, my understanding is that notwithstanding what happens in the short term, if you look at the long term then definitely both these stocks they add value to an individual’s portfolio. so I would say hold on to it."

 There has been worry that after the setback suffered by the ruling NDA in the Bihar elections reforms momentum may slow down. 

 “The FDI and disco (distribution companies) announcements highlight how the government can make reform progress using its regulatory and executive powers,” Fitch said in a statement adding that reforms indicate India’s reforms momentum remains intact. 
 

 On Tuesday, in a significant reform of its foreign direct investment policy, the government had opened up as many as 15 sectors more, lifting caps for many sectors, putting others on automatic routed and easing other conditions for others, notably brand retail. 

 The power sector package announced on November 5, seeks to reboot the burdened distribution sector by transferring three-fourth of their debt to respective state government and archiving the rest 25% through long term bonds. 

 “These changes align with the government's broad-based reform agenda, and should support investment and real GDP growth over the long term,” said Fitch, said adding that the two measures suggest government can press ahead with reforms. 

 There is fear that the government will find it difficult to push through legislative reforms after the Bihar setback with emboldened opposition raising the pitch on some of the contentious measures, a point noted by Fitch. 

 It said: “However, other big reforms such as the implementation of a national value added tax, will require a two-thirds approval in the legislature and face stiffer political obstacles.” 

 The government wants to roll out GST from April 1, 2016 but the legislation needed to do so is stuck in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling coalition does not have a majority. 

 The ratings agency has forecast 7.5% growth in the current financial year and 8% each in the next two years. 

 Fitch noted that power package could raise general government debt up to 2% of GDP, but added this was not likely to impact India's ratings because of the positive impact of other reforms. 

 “Importantly, the reforms create an incentive structure for state governments to reduce losses at discos by requiring the state governments to assume a certain share of losses at these entities,” it said."
Broader markets valuations look attractive: Ambit Capital,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/broader-markets-valuations-look-attractive-ambit-capital/articleshow/21000783.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Broader markets valuations look attractive: Ambit Capital,"MUMBAI: The midcaps and smallcaps have been underperforming the Sensex on Y-o-Y basis. The recent volatility in the Indian markets due to rupee depreciation has also put pressure on the broader markets. 

 Gaurav Mehta, Technical Analyst, Ambit Capital is of the view that while the Nifty is at the beginning of a bull run, the valuations of broader markets look attractive as compared to largecaps. 

 ""Relative valuations of small caps to large caps (as measured by a P/B ratio of BSE Small Cap Index to BSE Sensex are at multi-year lows; historically these cheap valuations have been followed by market rallies. A similar picture can be painted for the relative valuations of mid caps to large caps suggesting broader markets offer good value, both absolutely and more so on a relative basis,"" he said. 

 According to him, a long run bullish phase is around the corner for Indian equities. He sees the Nifty testing 6,350 over the next few weeks and successfully breach it on the upside. 

 ""Nifty on log, weekly charts has carved out an ascending triangle over the last few years. Such patterns are usually resolved to the upside implying a breakout from the 6,300-6,400 resistance range is a high likelihood over the next few weeks. More importantly the major uptrend that we embarked upon in 2003 is still intact as well. On the flip side, 5,650-5,700 should be a region of strong long term support for the index,"" he added. 

 The ""Real"" or inflation adjusted Nifty suggests that the secular uptrend that started in 2003 is still intact for Indian equities, he says. 

 ""While downsides should be limited to the lower trendline (we are there already currently), a resolution of this pattern to the upside would imply massive upsides in the months ahead- this implies risk reward is favorable for buying Indian equities,"" he said. 

 At 12:40 p.m.; the S&P BSE Sensex was at 19,446.42, up 6.94 points or 0.04 per cent. The index has gained 10.23 per cent in one-year period. 

 The S&P BSE Midcap Index was at 6053.01, up 20.58 points or 0.34 per cent. It is down 4.13 per cent in last one year. 

 The S&P BSE Smallcap Index was at 5712.08, up 14.23 points or 0.25 per cent. The index has corrected 15.77 per cent from one-year ago levels."

After a gap of two years, jewellery exporters are witnessing orders coming from the US for jewellery and the units operating in Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) in Mumbai are flooded with enquiries. 

 The US jobs data for June has also sparked a fresh hope among jewellers. The US economy added a net 195,000 new jobs in June, official figures show. The figure is well above economists’ expectations of 165,000. 

 “Jewellers are expecting a 25%-30% growth in the US market in the current fiscal. The US is gradually coming out of recession and this is reflected in the enquiries that are coming from the country. We are seeing this sort of a demand after a gap of almost two years,” said Vipul Shah, chairman of Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council. 

 An increase in exports of gem and jewellery is a good news for the government which is trying hard to control the rising current account deficit (CAD) by curbing gold imports through a slew of measures. But for jewellery exporters, the government is ready to walk an extra mile. 

 Shah said Union commerce minister Anand Sharma has held a meeting with jewellery exporters and assured them of a steady supply of gold for exports. “He said that if any nominated agencies fail to supply gold, he would take action against them,” Shah said. 

 The jewellery units operating in SEEPZ are receiving a good flow of orders. Rajeev S Pandya, past president, SEEPZ Gems & Jewellery Manufacturers Association, said: “There has been an improvement in order position from June end. The industry had organised a jewellery show in Las Vegas in early June. The samples shown there have been well accepted by customers and they have started placing orders. 

 These are orders for the Christmas season. Some of the units in SEEPZ have their hands full while some have started receiving orders from the US. The US is compensating for the loss in Europe.” The Europe market is still reeling under a crisis and jewellers do not see an immediate recovery in that market. 

 “However, the West Asia and China markets are showing a good growth,” said Shah."

 Avinnash Gorakssakar: The company positively surprised everyone in this quarter.

The full year forecast for FY13 and FY14 could possibly be much better than what earlier analyst expected. There has been lot of under participation by participants at lower level. So, the market is getting a sense that this momentum and this sustained move is going to continue for the next couple of quarters. The price has moved up significantly.

D-Street week ahead: FIIs in wait & watch mode ahead of Bihar outcome,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/d-street-week-ahead-fiis-in-wait-watch-mode-ahead-of-bihar-outcome/articleshow/49605660.cms,m.economictimes.com,D-Street week ahead: FIIs in wait & watch mode ahead of Bihar outcome,"By Jimeet Modi 
 
 The stocks market came under selling pressure this week due to profit booking at higher levels. A set of good corporate quarterly numbers was discounted quickly. Stocks of companies that reported numbers in line or above estimates maintained status quo in prices, but companies whose Q2 numbers were below expectations got hammered. 

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have slowed down their buying spree and have gone into a wait and watch mode, awaiting the Bihar poll results. The market will remain subdued till the first week of November. 

 
Events of the week:  

 The US Federal Reserve in its bimonthly meeting for the first time gave a reasonable indication that US interest rates are likely to increase before the yearend, causing a flurry in global financial markets. 

 Domestic stock exchanges this week revised the contract value to minimum Rs 5 lakh in the derivatives segment, potentially impacting the liquidity in market. 

 The IPO of IndiGo although got over-subscribed six times, the retail investors quota went partially unsubscribed, indicating that market sentiments are bearish for the short term. At the same time, it also clearly showed that a huge bull market wrapped by frenzied activities of retail investors is yet to come. 

 
Technical outlook:  

 The Nifty50 has moved into profit-taking mode after rising 10 per cent since last month. The 8,100-8,000 levels are crucial for Nifty50 for medium-term strength. However, a close below 8,000 would indicate a reversal of the medium-term uptrend, which may potentially correct the entire rally since the beginning of September. 

 If the trend weakens and key levels are breached than Nifty50 can go down all the way to 7,800 level. The probability of continued weakness is high as the market is awaiting the important outcome of Bihar elections. 

 
Expectations for the coming week: 

 The mood of the market should remain mildly bearish with bouts of selling in stocks of companies that have reported earnings below expectations. Foreign investors have started hedging their long positions and have shifted to a wait-and-watch mode. 

 Corporate results have been good so far with fewer negative surprises, although majority of them have managed to keep the past momentum but the acceleration was clearly missing. The market can go into sideways consolidation with a negative bias for want of fresh triggers. 

 The market will most likely wait for Bihar election results before any substantial move. Nifty50 ended the week down by 2.70 per cent to close at 8,065.80.

This even as total rainfall so far this season is 10% above normal.“The steady progress of monsoon has already resulted in many commodities coming off their highs but we are still keeping a watch on the market,” Ramesh Abhishek, chairman, FMC told ET. 

 Chana, castorseed, coriander and jeera have witnessed significant volatility in recent times, especially after fears of a deficient monsoon cropped up. To tackle ‘abnormal’ volatility, exchanges at FMC’s instance have advanced the delivery period in the likes of castor, chana and coriander and even introduced additional margins on longs and shorts. As a result of these regulatory actions, entities attempting to squeeze sellers by cornering stocks in the physical markets and simultaneously mounting bullish bets in the futures market were forced out of the market. This reduced excessive volatility in counters like castor which saw historic delivery worth Rs 948 crore in the January contract on NCDEX. 

 So far 29,369 tonnes of castor have been delivered in the June contract that expires on June 19, 8500 tonnes in chana and 100 tonnes in coriander. The FMC this month advanced the delivery period in chana and coriander from June 11 to June 4 which resulted in those trying to manipulate the counters moving out of the market at the risk of being forced to take delivery a broker said. Nine of the ten top clients were net long castor on Thursday, the same being the case in chana, NCDEX data shows."

Government to review 'Call & Put Option' rules that hit DoCoMo exit plan,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/government-to-review-call-put-option-rules-that-hit-docomo-exit-plan/articleshow/48151524.cms,m.economictimes.com,Government to review 'Call & Put Option' rules that hit DoCoMo exit plan,"NEW DELHI: The government is set to review rules that led to the rejection of NTT DoCoMo’s proposal to sell shares to Tata Sons at a pre-agreed price to exit their joint venture five months ago. The move is aimed at attracting bigger private equity and venture capital investment in the booming ecommerce sector and other emerging areas.
 
 The finance ministry is looking at allowing greater pricing flexibility for securities with an exit valuation clause at a rate set beforehand, technically known as a ‘call and put option.’ “There are issues with pricing of quasi-equity instruments... We are examining the norms,” a senior government official aware of the development told ET, confirming that the regulations were being reviewed.
 
 The ‘call and put option’ rules have undergone frequent changes, creating policy confusion and delays that undermine business sentiment, according to experts.
 
 It was this year’s finance Act that shifted control on equity capital flows to the finance ministry from the Reserve Bank of India, giving the government power to review these rules. However, the government has to administer these in consultation with the central bank.
 
 
 
TATA-DOCOMO CASE
 
 In January, the RBI had suggested allowing the transfer of shares by a nonresident investor at a price higher than their fair value in view of the Indian partner's contractual commitments in the Tata-DoCoMo case. The policy allowed for a fair valuation different from the exit valuation agreed between the two investors in the telecom venture. The RBI’s view was that the contractual agreement should be honoured and pitched for a change in policy. The finance ministry, wary of changing the existing policy in one instance, asked RBI to take a view on the case in line with the central bank's own guidelines. It subsequently took over jurisdiction of the policy in the February budget.
 
 
CASE FOR MORE FELXIBILITY
 
 The Narendra Modi-led government, which has launched the Make in India initiative among others to boost economic activity, is keen to attract foreign capital to spur the country's manufacturing sector.
 
 Last week, the union cabinet cleared a policy to allow fungibility of all forms of foreign capital within sectoral caps as part of its drive to make the country a more attractive destination for overseas investors. The review of the ‘call and put option’ pricing rules are part of the government's push to iron out difficulties they posed for investment of risk capital in emerging areas. The central bank had also written to the finance ministry on the issue of pricing norms governing exits and the need to re-examine the existing policy. Industry has sought changes as well. “The pricing norms should facilitate the execution of the real commercial understanding between the parties, especially concerning the put/call option pricing for the deal, irrespective of the fair market valuation of the shares,” said Punit Shah, partner, Dhruva Advisors.
 
 
TROUBLED PAST
 
 A ‘call’ option allows the holder to buy shares in an entity at an agreed price, while a ‘put’ option allows an investor to sell. Though popular, these instruments were not looked upon with too much favour by the RBI as it was worried that they would lead to foreign debt coming in disguised as equity. Put options, which give special rights to foreign investors to sell back equity if certain conditions such as timely listing are not fulfilled by Indian company, were seen largely as facilitating debt flows that would go out after a certain period.
 
 In 2011, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), taking its cue from the RBI, had even banned these instruments but soon retracted the policy measure over fears it could slow down foreign investment. In 2013 the RBI, finance ministry, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and DIPP reached an understanding on these instruments and agreed to allow them with a one-year lock-in period after adhering to pricing norms.
 
 In its rules, the RBI said exits could not be at a price higher than that arrived at on the basis of return on equity, a change from the earlier norm based on the discounted cash flow method it had specified. After representations against this condition, in July 2014, the RBI said any internationally recognised pricing methodology would be accepted.
 
 The RBI's views in the case of Tata NTT DoCoMo were thus seen as a complete reversal of its earlier stance against such instruments.
 
 
Let them plan their exit 

 The rules for pricing of ‘call and put option’ have rarely been objective, informed more often than not by the fear of debt entering in the guise of equity. Such fears do not sit well with India’s attempts to bring private equity and venture capital to fund avalanche of ideas by the internet generation. And India’s external account is no longer vulnerable to a few billion dollars flowing out. Investors putting up risk money to funds innovation need to be commensurately rewarded. Simpler rules are called for to govern how companies provide exit to foreign investors. Within a broad framework this needs to be left to the companies."

The firm has also announced elevation of two of its directors, Ritesh Banglani and Rahul Chowdhri, as partners at the venture fund. 

 Singh had set up Helion in 2006 along with Ashish Gupta, Sanjeev Aggarwal and Rahul Chandra. While Gupta and Aggarwal are at the level of senior MD, Chandra is an MD at the venture capital firm which manages $600 million across funds. Singh will stay with Helion till March 2016 and effect a smooth transition. 

 ""This comes at a time when the fund has considerably increased the focus on technology investing,"" said the statement from Helion. 

 Former co-head of venture capital at Carlyle in India, Singh primarily focused on consumer sector investments at Helion Venture. He serves on boards of Fashionara, HummingBird, YLG Salons, Qwikcilver, Mast Kalandar, Yepme, Attano and LifeCell. 

 In his previous stints before venture capital, Singh worked as marketing head for Intel South Asia before which he was at Hindustan Unilever for a decade in functions like sales, marketing and product innovation. 

 Singh’s move coincides with Helion promoting two of its relatively younger team members.

Here why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/heres-why-devi-shetty-of-narayana-health-is-looking-to-hit-dalal-street/articleshow/48751746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Here's why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,"One afternoon last month, Dr Devi Shetty, who usually speaks to journalists as a philosopher would to an acolyte, sat in his gleaming office in the Narayana Health (NH) campus looking rather uneasy.

“According to Sebi rules, my lawyers say I’m not supposed to talk about future plans or financials,” he said, the words not sitting as comfortably on his tongue as cryoprecipitate just had. He sat back self-consciously. “But I can talk about healthcare in general, or maybe not... I don’t know, let’s see.”

It’s the most inarticulate anyone might have seen the good doctor. The reason for this unusual reticence is that NH is planning to launch a public issue soon. The multispecialty hospital chain, valued at an estimated Rs 5,000 crore and currently financed by investors CDC and JP Morgan, hopes to raise Rs 1,200-1,500 crore from the market.

So, although Shetty had agreed to a conversation at this pivotal moment, it called for a certain guardedness and occasional disclaimers. The IPO his biggest expansion plan yet was like a flashing billboard we were desperately trying not to look at.

Dr Shetty was in loose blue scrubs, a surgical mask dangling at his neck. His hands were pink with just-washed germlessness and he exuded the distracted calm of surgeons. He had a bypass in a couple of hours. “Do you mind if I ate lunch while we talked?” Out came a steel lunch carrier from home: rotis, vegetables, curd and mangoes but he kept going for the Mangalorean fish fry.

As he ate, he evoked the elusive dream of shedding all administrative responsibilities to simply be a cardiac surgeon. “I had to set up a whole hospital chain to be able to come back to doing the work I love, the way I want to do it,” he said laughing and chewing.

“That’s the magic and pain of entrepreneurship.” But an IPO and public listing will add several responsibilities that will inevitably fight for attention with cardiac surgery, his first love. It will also test Shetty’s ability to balance his social agenda — affordable surgeries for the poor — with investors’ expectations of reasonable returns.

Why an IPO NH treats more than 2 lakh in-patients and around 15 lakh out-patients annually, most of them from rural and underprivileged backgrounds. This was Shetty’s vision when he established NH, then Narayana Hrudayalaya, in the year 2000 to create a space for accessible, affordable healthcare.

Still, many of his anecdotes betrayed a restiveness. Yes, NH was the world’s largest low-cost hospital. “But did you know that India needs 20 lakh heart surgeries a year, but is capable of doing only around 1.2 lakh?”

“Mothers ask how much a surgery for their child will cost. I quote an amount. If they don’t have that much, they won’t get the operation. That’s what I do – that’s what all Indian doctors do – every day: put a price on a child’s life,” he said. The IPO will help NH build more hospitals to do more such surgeries cheaper.

Shetty’s son and senior vice-president Viren Shetty puts it pithily: “The IPO will enable us to be more us.” But the IPO will also bring the added responsibility of earning reasonable financial returns for shareholders.

Being a publicly listed company will open the low-cost hospital to the cycle of quarterly results and shareholder expectations and financial pressures that might compete with Shetty’s social goals.

Shetty himself was uncomfortable with it in the past. In a speech in June 2012, he had explained why his family candidly.


	 


“We are in business because we want to help the underprivileged and the cost of healthcare to come down. For that, I need the freedom.” At that time, his eccentric enterprise was funded by private investors JP Morgan and AIG, from whom they raised `200 crore each. In January 2015, UK-based CDC invested Rs 300 crore.

Then, Shetty kept his freedom and his private investors through standardisation and scale — investor speak for rationalising expenses and treating large numbers of poor people with the quality they deserve.

Shetty’s famously soft voice searched for a new phrase for his frequently quoted goal of ‘Walmartising’ healthcare, which he is now weary of. “Size for social impact, size for sustainability,” he finally said.

NH pursues economies of scale with a vengeance: it performs among the world’s largest number of heart surgeries, aggressively reduces costs through centralised purchases of supplies and innovates processes from billing to intensive care. NH does this in its 31 hospitals in 19 cities in India, and one in the Cayman Islands off the coast of the USA.

Walking through any NH campus is like seeing the wide gap between a government and private multi-specialty hospital close. Two floors below Shetty’s quiet office in the Bengaluru campus, the emergency ward teems with patients, nurses holding IVs, and doctors running soundlessly through hallways. A reed thin woman from Manipur sits under a tree near the cancer centre, breastfeeding her daughter — her husband was having surgery later that day.

It would cost her Rs 80,000, half of how much other private Indian hospitals charged. Another elderly woman from a village in Belgaum said her son was recovering from a bypass, paid in full by the microhealth-insurance scheme NH had pioneered for poor cooperative farmers in 2003 with the Karnataka government.

The Bengaluru hospital performs 49 surgeries a day, using specialists, high volume and technology to drastically reduce the time and cost of treatments. “How do we stay low-cost?” asked Shetty. “Because we’re big. Because we’re big, we can roll out the innovation across the hospitals. We can dictate terms in our purchases, we can maximise the use of expensive clinical equipment.”

While most hospitals use their infrastructure for around 8 hours, NH claims to use it for 12-14 hours a day. The average number of CT scans per machine in India is a maximum seven while in NH, Shetty said it is about 30. Since NH implants the largest number of heart valves in the world, valve manufacturing companies can sell their products at a lower cost to the hospital.

NH’s revenue in the latest available data for 2013-14 was Rs 1,072.68 crore, roughly a fifth of the biggest healthcare player Apollo’s and fourth of Fortis’. In the five years leading up to March 2014, however, NH’s income grew at a rate of 35%, ahead of Apollo and Fortis that grew at 18.7% and 29% respectively in the same period.

Volumes, cost cuts and tiered pricing have enabled NH to manage a net profit growth rate of 3.5% in the last five years kept a majority stake in the company. “We are eccentric people,” he had said (see Narayana Health vs...). “We make only a small margin compared to other big hospitals, but we are staying afloat treating a majority of poor patients for half the price,” said Shetty.

It’s All for the Mission A doctor from Manipal Hospital called NH “a temple for Devi Shetty”. Dozens of patients waited outside Shetty’s Bengaluru office, and an elderly man treated by NH’s senior oncologist used the word “darshan” when he said he wanted to catch a glimpse of Shetty before returning to his village. In Shetty’s defence, Vasuki, who has worked with Shetty for more than a decade, puts it down to “gratitude”.


	 


A few of Shetty’s detractors imply that it is the personal charm, not the hospital’s model that has opened doors for NH and smoothened expansion. In a blog post on June 9, 2012, Mumbai-based Dr Aniruddha Malpani, a popular infertility specialist, disparaged Shetty as “healthcare’s blue-eyed boy… unlikely to ever be critically analysed”. He also writes that Shetty has “political clout”.

Indeed, the doctor is friendly with Karnataka’s senior Congress leaders, the most well-known relationship being that with SM Krishna, who was chief minister when NH opened its first hospital off Bengaluru and set up the micro-health insurance scheme with the Karnataka government.

NH has also provided free primary health services since 2005 in 15 blocks of Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli and Amethi, constituencies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. In 2012 in Ahmedabad, the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi provided land for and inaugurated NH’s multispecialty hospital.

Now, Shetty continues to meet prime minister Modi as the secretary of the Association of Health Providers India. The connections give NH access to cheap land, trimming a large component of building a hospital.

It has helped NH grow not only in Karnataka and Gujarat, but also Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Assam.

Public-private partnerships like microhealth insurance and low-cost care centres also help displace the cost by getting the state, instead of the patient or NH, to foot part of the bill. While the harshest critics imply favouritism, no one suggests foul play.

Shetty’s healthcare visionary persona also seems to attract young, passionate healthcare professionals to the hospital. Like Dr Arvind Ranganathan in the first floor cardiac ICU, who is setting up iKare, a point-of-care app created by NH and IT Services firm Cognizant to centrally record and monitor patient vitals.

Or the Bengali-speaking young office manager Rajeev Yadav, who helped When Dr Ranganathan spoke of coming to NH after spending years in the US with healthcare startups, and Yadav of growing up poor in Kolkata wondering if he could ever afford to do social work, they glowed with the same sense of purpose.

Both seemed to believe Shetty had picked them personally for the job. Undeniably, Shetty’s surgical-outfit wearing, kindly, always accessible image has swayed private investors, suppliers, governments and healthcare professionals to back his unconventional ideas.

The public shareholder is the new frontier. The global praise for NH’s business model, and its ever-expanding existence has encouraged many small healthcare ventures across the country to scale up.

Low-cost care, smarter diagnosis, and India-proof medical technology are now funded by a growing cluster of impact investors – those who invest in companies with social goals. “In the last 10 years, the availability for funding in healthcare has exploded, and many are not charitybased, but for-profit models,” said Ashwin Naik, founder of Vaatsalya Healthcare, which sets up low-cost hospitals in small towns.

A PwC report said the average investment size by private equity funds in healthcare had increased from US$5-15 million to US$ 20-30 million, most of it in diagnostic centres and hospital chains. It is significant why NH chose an IPO at this juncture.

“The immediate reasons are that Narayana’s current investors are looking for an exit,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Dr Shetty’s friend, co-promoter, neighbour and Biocon founder, who runs the cancer centre in NH. “Some of the capital raised will be used to pay off debts to them. The rest will help Devi’s model reach even more people.”

Viren described it as a moment to tackle “the new problem of scale”. “We have solved the problem of cost. Now it’s about more land, more buildings, more technology, more doctors, more patients.” Today, NH has 6655 beds in all, but Shetty has always said his dream was 30,000 beds by 2020.

“To achieve that kind of size, you can’t but go to the market,” Shaw said. Size can be the reason for the IPO, but could the IPO shake the social-commercial balance of NH? Public investors might demand a greater returns, challenging NH’s working equation of social good and financial returns.

In recent years, for instance, the company has not paid any dividends, even if, with a majority stake, Shetty’s family would have stood to gain the most. It is a testament to the model’s intention of funnelling all gains into the social goal, but such a decision might not be as easy when public shareholders are involved.

Roopa Kudva, managing director of impact investor Omidyar Network, disagrees. Financial pressures are “constructive” for social businesses, said Kudva, also the former MD and CEO of ratings agency Crisil. “From businesses with social goals, investors would expect discipline, not unreasonable profit.”

Amit Bhatia, CEO of Impact Investors Council believes the NH IPO will be “a path-breaking one”, providing evidence that “businesses can do good and still be responsible in terms of economics.”

Viren Shetty argues that the vision was never constrained by having forprofit investors in the past, and the challenges with going public could be no less than before. “NH has never been flush with profits. Investors, private or public, know what we stand for when they put their money in it,” he says.

The senior Shetty is less direct. A few times in the interview, he asked this one question, in different ways: “Who says a for-profit hospital cannot achieve social impact, and do it for 20, 30, 40 years?”

Now he has to convince investors.

According to an ET Now poll, the company is likely to report a net profit of Rs 944 crore, up 8 per cent, as compared to a net profit of Rs 871 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. 

 Net sales are seen up 12 per cent at Rs 7,198 crore as against Rs 6,433 crore in the same quarter last fiscal year. 

 EBIDTA is seen up 8 per cent at Rs 1,178 crore as against Rs 1,089 crore; while EBIDTA margins may dip slightly to 16.36 per cent versus 16.92 per cent. 

 Analysts are expecting top line growth to be led by volumes and prices. They see 10 per cent revenue growth in domestic FMCG business. Volume growth is seen to be in the range of 4-5 per cent. 

 Higher tax rate and lower other operating income is likely to restrict PAT growth. Margins could contract on the back of high ad expenses in oral care segment. Margins of personal products are expected to contract and the delay in winter season is likely to impact skincare segment.

Efforts mounted by the company over the past few quarters now appear to be bearing fruit for the FMCG company. More than 50% of its product portfolio has either been relaunched or rebranded. 
  
  It has increased its coverage to 5,000 more stores — most of them in rural areas. A volume growth of 13.5%, in spite of past year’s high base in the face of an intense competition, looks impressive. Operating profit, which rose 9%, was largely impacted due to high input cost. 
  
  Selective product price increases and a calibrated adspend could not help the company boost operating profit margins. While the MNC consumer giant has successfully managed to defend its leadership across categories, the moot point is how much of this is sustainable in a high inflation scenario and growing competition from national and regional players as well as other multinational companies. In 2010, the company was seeking to push up volumes through price cuts and discounts on products. 
  
  This year, it has changed the tack and is taking price increases on products back to year-ago levels. The company has indicated that the mix of price and volume growth is likely to change since increase in prices may put pressure on volume growth. Investments in brands given competition and higher input cost inflation are two cost heads for FMCG firms. 
  
  For HUL, addressing this ought not be tough, considering its deep pockets. It will need to adjust adspends and brand equity to pass on input costs to consumers. However, soaps and detergents , the largest revenue-earner segment for HUL, continues to be a sore point for the company. This category is marked by competition, rising raw material prices and a slowdown in consumer demand. HUL appears to have adopted a wait and watch approach to gauge consumer behaviour in this category. 
  
  One of the few FMCG stocks to have declined since the start of 2011, HUL’s stock has now fallen 9%. With its performance back on track, the company’s stock, which is now trading at a price to earnings multiple of 27 and a dividend yield of 2.3%, looks attractive among FMCG stocks. 
  
  The markets appear to have recognised that with the stock surging 3.5% on Monday after the results. However, given the current macro economic scenario, HUL will have to up its game to sustain this performance, if it has to emerge as a favourite among investors again."

Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) is said to be launching its tax-free bond issue worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8. 

 It is about 6.5 times the size of earlier issues of tax free bonds from NTPC, PFC and REC, which were of Rs700 crore each. Retail investors got meagre allotment in the earlier issuances due to the smaller size though 40% of the issue size was reserved for them .Typically those who applied for Rs1 lakh, got allotment worth Rs 12,000-15,000 due to heavy subscription. 

 Being a big issue, the chances of allotment in IRFC are higher. Distributors are urging investors to apply for a slightly higher amount to get their quota. “The issue size from IRFC is six times more than that of the earlier issues. 

 Interest rates on offer are also marginally higher,” says Jyotheesh Kumar, Senior Vice-President, HDFC Securities. These tax-free bonds will have three tenures — 10 years, 15 years and 20 years. The 10-year bonds for retail investors will carry 7.32%, 15-year bonds will offer 7.53%, while the 20-year bonds will offer 7.5%. 

 “If investors, want an allotment of Rs 5 lakh, they would do well to apply for about Rs8 lakh as we expect a 50-60% oversubscription in this issue as well,” says Rupesh Bhansali, Head (Distribution), GEPL Capital. High networth individuals, who typically make applications for over Rs10 lakh, could also look at splitting applications. 

 Investors, who want allotment of up to Rs40 lakh, could consider splitting applications across family members of Rs10 lakh each for their applications to be considered in the retail category. This also helps in getting a higher interest as the retail category carries a 0.25% higher interest as compared to the HNI category."

 ET Now: Is it a good time now to revisit some of those exporters because it is highly unlikely that Reserve Bank of India will allow rupee to appreciate quite dramatically? Because if the rupee appreciates, it will automatically challenge all the economic recovery. CAD problems will come to the fore and exporters will rendered extremely uncompetitive. What is your take on this?
 
 Prateek Agarwal: Yes, I would agree with you completely. The rupee has really appreciated to a level higher than was warranted. Policymakers themselves have been saying so. I thought they were comfortable when the rupee was at 60-61 kind of a band.
 
 It is vital for the economy that rupee stabilises at whatever level it touches. That alone can help people plan and export and grow. Extreme high degree of volatility in the rupee on the stronger side helps the market, but may not be good for the economy.
 
 We have seen what happened in the past when the rupee appreciated very sharply to 40. For some time, we had run a current account surplus but after that, the deficit became extremely huge. So, I am of the view that the rupee needs to stabilise. It should stabilise at current levels.

 The regulator FMC had late last month said the promoter Jignesh Shah and the promoter group Financial Technologies were not ""fit and proper"" to run not only the crippled NSEL but also MCX and any other exchange in the country. 

 After a marathon board meet that lasted over six hours today, the new MCX board, comprising representatives of various banks, selected Manoj Vaish, who at present is the managing director of NSDL Database Management. 

 Vaish was an executive director of the BSE between 1998 and 2004 and CEO of financial services research firm Dun & Bradsheet. 

 The board interviewed seven candidates and three were shortlisted -- Dilip Bhatia, CEO of Ace Commodities Exchange; Anil Mishra, managing director and CEO of National Multi-Commodity Exchange and Manoj Vaish, sources said. 

 The interviews were conducted after Shreekant Javalgekar stepped down as the MD and CEO of MCX following the Rs 5,600-crore scam at its sister concern the National Spot Exchange (NSEL), co-promoted by MCX promoter Financial Technologies, in late July. 

 More than 70 people had applied for the top job at MCX, including two exchange insiders, a former National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) chief and officials of Reliance Commodities, IFCI, Central Depository Services and NSDL Database Management, sources said. 

 While Satyanand Mishra was appointed MCX chairman late last year, the selection of the new MD was important as FTIL promoter has already been declared as not fit and proper to run the exchange.

They appear to be fairly resilient. But the market is concerned about the outlook with respect to revenue growth. Of course, there is an issue with respect to margins. which is largely a factor of the boom that we saw last year.
 
That is broadly in the price but on a relative basis, the valuations have come down quite a bit. Large names have corrected from a PE valuation with a forward standpoint from something like 30-34 levels to currently about 24-23 levels. It has come down. There is still some amount of downside in valuation that is there. So maybe a 5-10% downside is possible but it is approaching a value zone as far as the IT sector is concerned. One should look at the largecaps.
 

How would you approach metals now given that on one side, there is a demand challenge and on the other side, there is a recession fear?With respect to metals, I have been an underweight for the last one year. We are looking at deceleration in the manufacturing sector across the world. If you look at the PMIs in developed markets, in Europe, the US and China, there has been significant deceleration and a marked contraction as well in major countries.
 
So the demand for metal is likely to be under pressure. If you look at various markets, there has been almost like a 40-50% correction in steel prices. Also with respect to aluminium, zinc, etc, there has been a considerable contraction. So I think metal space actually did very well last year, from an Indian player standpoint they benefited a lot through a large amount of exports and stuff. Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel. There is a glut in the domestic market and we are seeing that steel imports are also happening from China. 
 
There is intense competition and I have been a sell on steel and metal companies. I would continue to be so going forward because when central banks the world over are fighting inflation, commodities would not do well. For me, commodities in general and metals are underweight. So on any rise in steel and other metal stocks, I would sell.


The big macro concern, what is happening to the pound? How is the UK economy becoming topsy-turvy? What happens to companies which are dependent on the UK like Mastek, HCL Tech, TCS, Tata Motors?What we have to really put into context is that post Covid, Indian manufacturers actually enjoyed quite a bit of export exposure, especially given the context that there were fairly tight supply issues in the US, Europe and UK. There was a huge amount of fiscal stimulus. The volume growth for Indian manufacturers actually went up disproportionately.
 
ET Now: How would you view a business like Paytm? Purely the business, forget where the stock is headed?
Dhananjay Sinha: I think the Paytm business may do well. The best of volume growth is behind us, given the digitisation theme that was evident post Covid. A lot of that was being valued. Going forward, is this going to repeat the kind of buoyancy that we have seen earlier? I do not think so. Increasingly, the business model will have to be a function of what it does through the transactions, the buffer that it creates through transactions etc.
 
There are limitations with respect to what it can do. There are financial regulations that it will be subject to. So value creation from here on can be very limited.


What do you want to buy in a market decline?The risk of the market being on the downside is definitely there. We are looking at earnings cuts. In the first quarter, we have seen a 3.5% cut for Nifty earnings. We are looking at something like a 15% odd cut for the full year. So there is a downside as far as the market is concerned.
 
Secondly, given the context that the risk free rate is actually rising and more rate hikes will happen, the valuations might also be a challenge. Overall it would be relevant to be more defensive as far as the market is concerned. High beta sector such as metals, capital goods, industrials, mid and smallcaps are the things that will be relatively lower in my pecking order. 
 
I have been somewhat positive on urban consumption themes in autos, discretionary. Staples has done well, ITC continues to be a good value stock and continues to do well. Autos have done phenomenally well. Over the last year, I have reduced some overweight there. 
 
I would say that I am looking at pharma stocks at this juncture. There is a reasonable amount of visibility as far as the earnings are concerned and there are certain stocks which are available at good value and the sector has not done much over the last one year it comes at a good value. Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy, Ajanta and Indoco Remedies are some of the stocks that have come from our sort of pick. That is broadly the profile of things that we have in our portfolio.
 

Would you bet into oil consumers like Indigo?One should be looking at something like Asian Paints or Berger Paints because they have oil intermediates as inputs. They have a monopolistic market presence and pricing power etc. One should really look at such things. Asian Paints is something that I like in terms of valuations. Also, if you look at the market cap to sales ratio, what I look for has come down quite a bit over the last six odd months. 
 
So one would rarely get a chance in 20-30 years when we may see a sharp correction in such stocks. Any correction out here should be bought I would say so that is what you know I would play this oil with actually."
Narendra Kothari takes over as new  Chairman and Managing Director of NMDC,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/narendra-kothari-takes-over-as-new-chairman-and-managing-director-of-nmdc/articleshow/34057596.cms,m.economictimes.com,Narendra Kothari takes over as new  Chairman and Managing Director of NMDC,"NEW DELHI: Narendra Kothari today took over as new Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of the country's top iron ore miner NMDC. Kothari replaces SAIL chief C S Verma, who held the additional charge of CMD NMDC. 

 Earlier, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) has chosen Narendra Kothari, CEO of SAIL's Burnpur plant for the post of NMDC's CMD. NMDC, the country's largest iron ore miner, had been without a full-time chairman after retirement of its regular head Rana Som on December 31, 2011. 

 ""The Government of India has appointed Shri Narendra Kothari, CEO, SAIL as CMD on the Board of NMDC for a period of five years with effect from the date of assumption of charge of the post or till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier,"" NMDC said in a filing to the BSE. 

 In terms of the government order, Kothari has ""assumed charge of the post of CMD of NMDC on April 21, 2014,"" the miner said. It added that consequent to the development, Verma ceases to be CMD and Director of the Company with effect from April 21, 2014. 

 The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had in July 2011 suggested the name of M S Rana, CMD, Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India, for the post. But, the Steel Ministry was not in concurrence with the PESB's recommendation and instead gave company's Technical Director N K Nanda additional charge. 

 Following some issues that cropped up, SAIL Chief C S Verma was given the additional task and he continued at the helm of affairs of the country's top iron ore producer. Later, a panel headed by Planning Commission Member Arun Maira, recommended two candidates for the top job - Narendra Kothari and T K Lahiry, CMD of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd in May last year. NMDC produced 30.18 million tonnes (MT) iron ore in last fiscal and sold 30.50 MT of the key steel-making raw material."

  Do you really sense that perhaps on a long-term basis while right now fair enough the telecom balance sheets are looking overstretched but with 3G because that has higher efficiency than the current 2G? Your BWA can be used for WiMAX as well and be used for 4G. On a long-term basis, do you see a whole lot of value accretion? 
  
  Yes, absolutely. Now the telecom companies would have to really focus on the value-added services as opposed to pure volume gain that they have been used to in the past and, therefore, there is tremendous amount of innovation that these people can do and keep on improving the margins, so once this competitive pressure eases out, it has already begun to ease out. 
  
  Once it settles down and the balance sheet also starts improving, that would be a time to really get back into some of the leading names and stay invested for the long term."

 ""We will start the basic process for IPO in the next 2-3 months ... we hope to hit the market in the early part of the next year,"" RBL Bank Managing Director Vishwavir Ahuja told PTI.
 
 ""The quantum of offer is not finalised yet but we plan to raise minimum Rs 500 crore or 10 per cent of stake dilution,"" he said.

ET Now: Do you think the secular rally in cyclicals is now coming to an end, and cyclicals in general are getting slightly exhausted? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: This has been our long-held view. I can give you some numbers for your convenience. Take two of the most expensive stocks in, let us say, a sector like FMCG, which most commentators will say is a very expensive sector. Take two of the very high-quality MNC names in the capital goods space. Have an optimistic projection for capital goods by which I mean 15% plus kind of sales growth, margins which are way higher than the current margins and average margins. Then look at what kind of profits are arrived at and what kind of valuation they trade versus FMCG. 

 So, if you compare the two you would find the FMCG story to be much more compelling. I am in no way saying that it is cheap. Actually the so called defensive part of the market today trades cheaper than the cyclical part of the market. Pharmaceuticals are valued very nicely, IT is cheap while growth there may be an issue. Sectors like capital goods and public sector banks are trading at valuations which will probably make these sectors — in the best case scenario — move sideways for some length of time."

Sonam Udasi
, Head of Research, IDBI
 Capital , shares his views on Infra. 

 
ET Now: What do you do with infra, stocks like IDFC and couple of other infra finances have corrected a quite a bit, still stay away from them? 

 
Sonam Udasi: No, it really depends on what is your perspective on the market. Our perspective is that in the near term despite what we have seen today, there is not much scope for you to rally further, you can do a 100 points here or there that said with the currency where it is and you are heading into an election year, despite the trade deficit coming where it is, it is likely that it will be perking up in July and August as well and as investors realise that if dollar is to stay here, they will look at gold positively. 

 If you cannot do dollar then gold is a natural hedge against the dollar in that sense so I suspect that with that view in mind in the near term the pressure will continue on IDFC. You will see bouts of buying and selling. But if you have a longer view, say 1-1/2 year kind of view, these valuations on IDFC and some of the stocks like BOB, PNB, you will only find when they are under stress and once that starts to clear out which I suspect will happen over six to eight months from now. Then that is real investment. But for now, you could probably buy IDFC after seven days again at the similar price which was yesterday."

UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/upa-takes-sheen-off-psu-stocks-since-it-came-to-power-in-2004/articleshow/29540056.cms,m.economictimes.com,UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,"The government’s family jewels have lost some of their sheen in the past 10 years. Shares of state-run companies have underperformed the broader market since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power in 2004, an ET Intelligence Group analysts shows. That comes after the PSU index outpaced the BSE Sensex by a huge margin during 1999-2004, when the BJP was heading the ruling coalition.
 
 The PSU index rose 60 per cent in the first term of the UPA, whereas the Sensex rose at double that pace during those five years starting 2004. Under UPA-II, the PSU index lost 6 per cent so far, compared with a 73 per cent gain in the benchmark.
 
 During the NDA rule, the PSU index that exists since February 1999 jumped more than 300 per cent, compared with a 70 per cent gain in the benchmark index. Base effect played a part in these comparisons, but there were other reasons as well that influenced the performance of PSU stocks during the UPA and NDA rules, an analyst said.
 
 ""The outperformance of PSUs starting 1999 was on the background of a severe industrial slowdown that had led a large number of companies into distress,"" said Phani Sekhar, fund manager of portfolio management services at Angel Broking.
 
 For instance, he said, the shares of Steel Authority of India were trading below their face value and banks were grappling with very high non-performing assets at that time, so ""a part of their subsequent out-performance was on a lower base"". However, he said, the NDA government also had a stated privatisation policy and it carried out privatisations of companies such as Hindustan Zinc and Maruti Suzuki, making PSUs lucrative for investors.
 
 ""This, along with improving GDP growth, helped PSUs to outperform."" Under the UPA’s first term, the department of disinvestment was closed down, he said. ""Environmental issues and policy flip-flops impacted investor perception towards PSUs, which were already richly priced.
 
 In the last couple of years, FPO (follow-up public offer) announcements destroyed valuations due to lack of buying appetite,"" Sekhar added. The BSE PSU index currently comprises 59 shares with Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Coal India , State Bank of India, NTPC and NMDC representing the top five constituents.
 
 Unlike other indices, which consider free-float market capitalisation of the constituents, the BSE-PSU index is based on full market capitalisation of its constituents and consists of PSUs from the BSE500 group. The data analysed by ETIG exclude those of banks due to their different reporting structure, and companies such as Coal India, Oil India and NHPC, which got listed mid way.
 
 
 As the data suggest, the last five years under the UPA-2 have been particularly bad for PSUs, although the government kept selling more shares in these companies in a bid to tide over a burgeoning fiscal deficit. The financials of these PSUs have also shown a steady decline in the second term of the UPA.
 
 Total return on equity and return on capital have shown a steady year-on-year decline from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2013. ""This is because the government did not create a regulatory environment suitable for doing business,"" blamed Sankaran Naren, chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential.
 
 Currently, they are a good value buy, but there is always the government risk existing in these stocks, he added. The return on equity and return on capital employed are important ratios that capture the amount of profits generated by a corporate per unit of investment made in it. Higher the ratio, the better. The price-to-book value of these companies has fallen to 1.2 now from 2 in 2009.
 
 In fact, the market values of a few companies such as SAIL, Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil and Nalco have dropped below their book value. Book value is the total net worth of a company and is calculated by adding reserves and surplus to the share capital. PSUs’ growing debt levels were another key factor making investors nervous.
 
 The debt of 53 listed PSUs — net of cash and bank balance — jumped over three-fold to Rs 2.64 lakh crore at the end of March 2013 from Rs 85,000 crore at the end of fiscal 2009. The biggest debt amassers were from two important industries — petroleum and power — which have seen policy-led impediments.
 
 Indian Oil, BPCL, HPCL, Power Grid and NTPC together held Rs 2.82 lakh crore net debt at end-March , more than doubled since fiscal 2009. On the other extreme, the top five cash-rich PSUs witnessed 80 per cent growth in their idle cash position between FY09 and FY13. It were the remaining 43 PSUs that witnessed a spurt in indebtedness, from less than Rs 1,500 crore in FY09 to Rs 86,000 crore in FY13.
 
 The most notable names turning from cashrich to highly indebted in this period include SAIL, Shipping Corporation and MTNL. This doesn’t mean the lot will continue to under-perform. ""Health-wise , the PSUs are much better placed today compared with 1998-99 ,"" said Angel’s Sekhar. ""It is regrettable that they are underperforming their potential. Given some policy clarity, they have the potential to out-perform once again."""
Want to bet on Infosys? Five reasons why you should wait and watch,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/want-to-bet-on-infosys-five-reasons-why-you-should-wait-and-watch/articleshow/36437210.cms,m.economictimes.com,Want to bet on Infosys? Five reasons why you should wait and watch,"NEW DELHI: The appointment of Vishal Sikka as the CEO and MD of India’s second largest software exporter has come as a fresh ray of light for the investors of Infosys as it clears the underlying uncertainty, but it will be a long haul before any meaningful recovery can be seen in the stock.

Infosys, which wore the tag of IT bellwether some time back, is now struggling to regain confidence of its investors. India’s second largest IT exporting company has been witnessing a tepid growth in sales and profits since the past four years.

The stock has plunged a little over 18 per cent from its peak of Rs 3847.20 recorded on 3 March 2014, marred by a series of senior level exits and slowdown in sales. On YTD basis, Infosys is down a little over 9 per cent, as of data collected on 11 June.

""Vishal Sikka will be the next CEO of Infosys. This could likely be a long haul even if he’s the right man for the jog,"" said JP Morgan in a report. Even if he is the right man for the CEO job at Infosys, time will only say so. We believe this might be a really long haul for both Dr. Sikka and Infosys, added the report.

Vishal Sikka, a former SAP AG executive board member, was on Thursday appointed as Infosys’ Chief Executive Officer and MD. With his appointment, Sikka becomes the first non-founder CEO of Infosys.

The company also announced that Executive Chairman NR Narayana Murthy and Executive Vice Chairman S Gopalakrishnan would step down on June 14. Rohan Murty will also leave the company on June 14.

We have collated five possible reasons why Infosys will remain subdued in the short term, but remains a good long-term bet:

Building the right team: The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock at least for the time being and building the right team will be most important task in light of the recent senior-level exits. Infosys is a more of service-led company and Vishal Sikka comes from a product background, which is very different from the services business.

""Rebuilding the team will be a major challenge for him since the core team has left the company. Vishal has to build his own team and that is very important because one person cannot change a large company like Infosys,"" said Former Infosys Board Member V Balakrishnan.

""He also has to quickly connect with the clients and give them comfort, because clients have been worried since the leadership transition took a long time,"" he added.

Balakrishnan is of the view that Vishal, with his pedigree, looks like the right person for this role, but the jury is still not out on whether he will be able to perform to his full potential.

In light of the recent top-level exits, Mr. Sikka’s first job would be to comfort the people and tell them that the company has faith in them despite the bad stretch. The challenge is to get the people believe in themselves and that they are for keeps.


	 

""This is the turning point for the company and calls for re-rating of the stock. However, the board also needs to get reconstituted in a manner that it has more independent ‘directors’ than what it has had at this point of time,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Consulting.

""The same board is not going to fix the problem, even if the CEO is different. Once you get the ghost out of the closet completely, you will find this company flying again,"" he added.



Brokerages are positive despite near-term concerns: 

Despite recent exits, most brokerage firms are positive on the stock and have a target price of Rs 3500-4000 for a period of the next 12 months.

Earlier in the month of June, Prasad Thrikutam, the global head for sales and marketing at Infosys, resigned from the company. Thrikutam’s exit came a week after Infosys President and CEO-hopeful BG Srinivas resigned and was the 12th senior-level exit after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to the company as the executive chairman last June.



				


JP Morgan has an ‘overweight’ rating on the stock and a target price of Rs 4000 by March 2015. Infosys appears to have more realistic targets in the current environment, which we believe is positive.

Their price target is based on a one-year forward P/E of 16.5x, at a modest (15%) discount to TCS’ target multiple of 19.0x. They believe that the discount is justified as TCS’ revenue growth and margin profile are better than that of Infosys.

IndiaNivesh is of the view that the stock is trading at 14.8x FY15E and 12.9x FY16E earnings estimates. Given the stable global environment, they are of the view that Infosys FY15 guidance is a bit on the conservative side. Hence they expect the upward revision in the guidance going ahead.

The brokerage firm has a 'BUY' rating on the stock with a target price to Rs.3,952 (valuing at 16.4x FY16E EPS).

May lead to more senior-level exits:

Infosys had been evaluating internal candidates for the CEO position as well and appointment of Dr. Sikka might drive another wave of resignation from the internal CEO hopefuls. So, the biggest challenge for Infosys will be of retaining talent.

However, the organization will likely stabilize after that, say experts. JP Morgan is of the view that Mr. Murthy’s stepping down should provide significant freedom to Dr. Sikka to rebuild the organization as per his vision.

Ankit Pandey of Quant Broking is of the view that there is still some uncertainty that will remain over the next three to four months. More people may decide to leave, he added.

""But there needs to be more hiring as well, especially because they have lost so many people at the top,"" added Pandey. So over the next six to nine months, there will be a lot of travelling, a lot of meeting with the clients and getting to know the company as a whole,"" he explained.


	 

Slowdown in growth likely to continue:

The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock for the time being, but revival in growth will take its time.

Although Dr. Sikka would bring in fresh thinking to the organization as a technology visionary, but being an outsider he would likely take time to figure out Infosys’ issues, culture, ways of working, politics, competitive landscape, onerous task of rebuilding a team - all of which will take time to show results. JpMorgan believes that Infosys’ expected recovery to industry-level revenue growth by FY16E will likely get pushed out further (maybe to FY17E or even beyond). All in all, they believe the company will take a longer-than-earlier expected time to get back to the respectable growth trajectory.

Apart from his valuable experience at SAP, Mr. Sikka will bring along his entrepreneur like visibility and proven success in tough global markets to the company.

""Although under his helm, Infosys may witness an improvement in performance through transition of activities, we believe that it may take time for the company to return to its growth trajectory,"" Microsec Capital said in a report.

""For the stock, the development is expected to remain positive in the near to medium term. However, the long term movement of the stock will continue to be determined by Infosys performance and improvement checkpoints in the quarters to come,"" added the report.

Sikka will be instrumental in boosting sales:

The appointment of Dr. Vishal Sikka's as the CEO and MD (designate) of Infosys is a positive development for the company and being a former SAP AG board member, analysts and industry experts expect him help the company win business from his former customers at SAP.

He will bring an innovation focus to the former IT industry bellwether, at a time when the industry is undergoing fundamental changes, ET reported.

In addition, his strong client relationships can help Infosys win business with new and old customers and improve revenue growth, Deutsche Bank said in a report. However, with his products background, we are concerned about Mr. Sikka’s ability to run a services company, it said.

Investors will now seek direction and clarifications from the new management on addressing issues of (a) high attrition, especially in sales, (b) loss of business and strategic vendor status from existing customers impacting revenue growth and (c) below par presence and acceptance in key growth market continental Europe, added the Deutsche Bank report."

“Free seats to domestic Malaysia destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru, Terengganu and more are also available from Kuala Lumpur . Only taxes and fees apply to these free seats, which will be available from INR 0 one way,” the statement added.

These tickets can be booked for a travel period of January 1–April 30, 2014, which, according to AirAsia officials is in line with the airline’s standard practise of encouraging advance bookings.

“This is a standard promotion offer all over the world for all routes and nothing to do with India entry as we may enter even before January next,” a company official said, declining to be named.


				

	
	The official also said that their offer was different from the one recently offered by Tiger Airways.
	
	In March, Singapore-based Tiger Airways opened a promotional offer for tickets to Singapore from Chennai, Kochi, Bangalore, Hyderabad Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchirapalli at $50 (Rs 2700) for travel between May 1st and December 15th. The tickets will be on offer until March 13.
	
	The scheme, which offered 10 seats on each flight, was one to celebrate five years of its Indian operations.
	
	In an earlier story, ET had reported that AirAsia’s standard practise is to open seat bookings a few months in advance at a nominal price, going up to ten times that sum near the flight day.

	 

	The idea is to stimulate the market with low fares till a certain percentage of seats are filled and then go to the highest levels. This is standard AirAsia practise across its network in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Japan arms, which would be later replicated in India.
	
	AirAsia flies 186 routes, covering 85 destinations throughout 18 countries.
	
	“We have predicted a fare war in the next 12 months. This is a precursor. AirAsia is stimulating the market in the backdrop of their India entry. Even if they sell 1 million seats at say Rs 4,000, we are looking at an upfront cash collection of Rs400 crore, which can help fund their India plans.

	
	This may force other Indian carriers to follow suit since the January-April period typically sees limited tourism traffic,” said Amber Dubey, partner and head (aviation) at global consultancy KPMG. Jet Airways, India’s secondlargest airline by market share, and Air India did not respond to ET’s queries. 


	Last Wednesday, the government cleared AirAsia’s proposal to start a passenger airline in India in partnership with the Tata Group and Telstra Tradeplace’s Arun Bhatia, whose son is married to the daughter of NRI billionaire Lakshmi Mittal. AirAsia will hold 49% stake, Tata Sons 30% and Bhatia 21% in the new venture.
	
	Rajan Mehra, a former India head for Qatar Airways and the managing director (India) for Universal Aviation — a business aviation services provider, said most airlines float such offers when they enter a new market. 


	“Such an offer is the best bet to make people aware that a customer-friendly airline is coming to town. So, in a way, it is a backhanded way of advertising their product. This could cause a cascading effect (in terms of response from other airlines),” Mehra said.
	
	Himanshu Singh, managing director of online travel portal Travelocity, concurred with Mehra’s views on AirAsia’s seat sale, but doubted whether Indian airlines would respond to the offer. “Indian carriers are mature enough not to react to such discounts. 
	 

	Given that AirAsia is entering India with a long-term plan, they will sooner or later look to tap passengers through a hub & spoke model, like Spice-Jet, and would want to fly Indians out. This scheme may well be the groundwork for that,” Singh surmised. “We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns at such a scale. 


	It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” said Siegtraund Teh, group chief commercial officer of AirAsia. “Free seats to domestic Malaysian destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru and Terengganu are also available from Kuala Lumpur.

	These tickets were on offer till March 13. The Tiger Airways scheme, which offered 10 seats on each flight, was to celebrate five years of its operations in India."

ET Now: IT sector has disappointed a bit with results from IT biggies Wipro and HCL Technologies coming in a tad below market expectations. Now, it's Infosys, which is lined up for results on Friday. Do you think that the whole of IT pocket is now approaching the oversold territory? Will IT stocks see more downside or is the sector a structural short for some more months to come?
 
 
Ajay Bagga: IT firms may clock a growth of 12-15 per cent on the topline front; expect them to report a similar growth on the bottom line front. As far as margins are concerned, it seems that they do not have much scope for improvement at least in the next 12 months.
 
 Overall, the sector is getting rerated from a high-growth sector to a sector more like utility. Having said that, IT stocks will give you decent returns. There will be no negative surprises; IT firms have managements that are pro-minority shareholders. Looking at these factor , I would recommend investors to look at IT as a global play.
 
 An advisor to the RBI has recently said that rupee is overvalued. He said he would be happy if rupee drops to to 64-65 levels against the greenback.
 
 If this happens, then IT could be a good hedge for Indian investors. Consumers will lose purchasing power once rupee starts falling. Hence, keeping IT in your portfolio will help you.
 
 It is a natural hedge and it is a global growth story. So own IT stocks with that perspective, especially when domestic consumption is getting constraint the way it is. With the poor monsoon, the consumption space could be hurt even more. IT will give you some balance in the portfolio. Having said that, I do not expect them to be top performers.
 
 IT managements are clearly lacking inspirational wisdom. If you look at the US market, they give back $600 billion to shareholders every year via share buybacks. They pay $400 billion in dividends.
 
 If you are doing nothing and keeping surplus cash in fixed deposits or liquid funds at 8 per cent rate, then it is better give it back to the shareholders at least. Here, I am talking about domestic IT companies."

If one goes by the enthusiasm with which Rakesh Jhunjhunwala participated in the company's earnings conference call, it could well be his next Titan Industries.
 
 ""Sir, congratulations to you and your team on unbelievable results,'' said Jhunjhunwala. ""Is your better margins also reflecting the fact that you were utilising the same plants for higher production. Because, I've not seen any analyst report which highlights this, or no realisation of the fact that higher utilisation will give you much higher margins.""
 
 Jhunjhunwala, known as the Indian Buffett, follows some of the fundamentals of investing of Buffett, renowned for value-based investing. Buffett, the world's fourth richest man, stunned investors when he bought the rail company Burlington Santa Fe at the peak of 2008 credit crisis, when economies were contracting. But his bet proved talismanic with a boom in shale gas exploration making Burlington a money machine.
 
 Something similar could be in the making with Tata Motors, which is riding high on its pre-crisis acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover. The company though has been squeezed in the domestic economic slowdown, has been reporting record profits due to Jaguar Land Rover.
 
 Jhunjhunwala, who made a strong impression as a value investor with his ownership of Titan Industries and Crisil, has been favouring Tata Motors even as others were sceptical about the company’s ability to manage the JLR acquisition. Tata Steel, a group company, is still struggling after it acquired Corus Group in 2007.
 
 But it is altogether a different story at Tata Motors. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 4,805 crore, up 195%, as against a net profit of Rs 1,628 crore in the yearago period.
 
 A Jhunjhunwala questions also reflects his worry.
 
 “Are you not afraid that you’re going into too many segments, and your brand may be affected.” But the comforting management words were that both Jaguar and Range Rover vehicles will maintain their product appeal and the brand and the value they stand for."

 His role will be taken over by fund managers Harrish Zaveri, Rohit Singhania and Vinit Sambre. Shah went through a rough patch in 2013, when funds managed by him underperformed as he bet on an early economic recovery. Early bets on a recovery in sectors such as metals, oil and gas, infrastructure hurt performance. 

 Though the schemes bounced back in late-2014 and outperformed their benchmark indices, distributors were unhappy with the performance compared to the peers.Shah was criticised for aggressive churning of stocks in fund portfolios. A DSP Blackrock spokesperson declined to comment."

ET Now: What is the first stock on your radar? Why is it that you like this stock?
 
 
G Chokkalingam: We like Moil. The stock has been underperforming the market for more than four years. The reason for selecting the stock is that I believe that manganese ore prices have bottomed out post the recent correction. The company has got huge cash as well. The cash itself is 80 per cent of the market cap. With Rs 20 EPS for the current year, if profit grows at that rate - which are very likely - the core assets of the company would be free in the next 1-2 years.
 
 The current market mcap would be equivalent to the free cash itself. In addition, we saw some forecast coming in from Chinese Steel Association last week. It said the Chinese capacity is going to be shut for at least 20 per cent of the total capacity. So I believe that in next six months, the metal outlook particularly for steel industry would start improving. This would be positive for Moil. Aalso this company has increased its capacity in the last two years. It has got new mines in Maharashtra. All these point towards a robust outlook for Moil."

 FCI, which plans to sell 10 million tonnes of wheat to millers using the NSPOT platform this year, began selling the grain via e-auction early this month. 

 In an official statement, NSPOT said the FCI witnessed a rapid increase in off-take of wheat within first three e-auctions conducted at its platform. 

 ""There has been a 76 per cent jump in the quantity of wheat sold to millers between August 7 and 21. The total quantity of wheat sold till now is 1.54 lakh tonnes,"" the company said. 

 Millers have bought wheat at prices ranging between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,836 per quintal, it said. 

 ""The efficiency, transparency and wider scale of operations that an electronic platform provides, allows both the PSU and the private players to be in a win-win situation."" NCDEX Managing Director and CEO Samir Shah said. 

 The auctions were again conducted on the NPSOT platform after completing a successful pilot last year, in which FCI sold 17 lakh tonnes of wheat through seven e-auctions, the company said. 

 The platform has allowed FCI to meet the twin objectives of timely transparent and efficient sales of wheat to private mills as well as reduce its own economic cost, it added.

However, that is far from the case as the performance of the New York Stock Exchange-listed HDFC Bank ADR during this period shows. 

 Foreign investors have not been able to purchase the India-listed HDFC Bank’s stock as it has hit the limit of 49% for foreign institutional investors or FIIs. But while HDFC Bank’s stock closed at Rs 835.50 on Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday, its ADR closed with a premium of more than 17% at about Rs 981 (after conversion). As the accompanying chart shows, the gap has widened consistently over the past six months. 

 At the same time, foreign investors have also been buying HDFC Bank’s stock in the futures market that can be converted into cash position if the FII limit in the bank is raised. Average monthly open interest for HDFC Bank in the futures market has been consistently increasing month after month. It has tripled in the past six months, compared with an increase of 35% for ICICI Bank and 74% for Axis Bank. 

 “If the FII limit is hiked, all these positions will be converted into cash positions, which can result in huge buying in the stock,” said Viraj Gandhi, senior analyst with ICICI Direct. 

 The average open interest in HDFC Bank’s stock for July was 3.4 crore, compared to 1.1 crore in January, while the cash volume in July was just about 60 lakh.
 
 
 “The stock is very attractively priced and is consolidating due to technical reasons. Nobody is willing to wait for the final approval on the limit as this price may not be available then, hence the huge position built up in the derivatives market and in ADR,” said a US-based hedge fund manager, who did not wish to be identified. “If the limit is hiked the HDFC bank’s stock price and HDFC Bank’s ADR price should converge somewhere in between.” 

 HDFC Bank has proposed to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India for an increase in the FII limit to 74% from 49% currently. It is not clear, though, whether the parent HDFC’s 22% stake in the bank will be included in the overall holding of FIIs, who already own 77% of HDFC’s shares. A decision in favour of the bank, as many traders and analysts expect by September, will raise the limit for foreign investors. 

 HDFC Bank’s stock has remained range-bound in the past three months even as the benchmark BSE Sensex has gained 16% while its peers Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have given 30% and 17% returns respectively. 

 Analysts say that this trend could reverse in the coming months, with a possible increase in limit for FII holding, equity issuance and talks of merger with HDFC."

 The Forward Markets Commission (FMC), under the Finance Ministry, is functioning with less than 100 officers and staff against a sanctioned strength of 135. Vacant posts have not been filled due to poor responses to job advertisements. 

 To augment its manpower position for the discharge of regulatory functions, the FMC has posted an advertisement inviting applications for the engagement of 20 experts or professionals on contract basis. 

 FMC wants to hire six candidates each in the legal and inspection departments, two staffers in investigation and one each in monitoring and surveillance, cyber forensic, company secretary, statistician, human resources and information and communication technology, it said. 

 Experts and professionals would be recruited at various levels in Mumbai and Delhi. Initially, they would be recruited for one year, which can be extended as per requirements. The applicants should be below 60 years of age. 

 The government has received lukewarm responses to job advertisements posted regularly since 2005. Now that the workload has increased in the wake of the NSEL payment crisis, FMC has taken the contract route to recruit officers. 

 The regulator oversees the functioning of six national and 11 regional bourses in the country."

""We certainly see a turnaround time in 2013-14 fiscal subject to business condition,"" GMR Group Chief Financial Officer Amarthaluru Subbarao said. ""We expect fund raising to be completed over the next six to nine months,"" he said.

The Bangalore-based conglomerate has also embarked on an 'asset light and right strategy' for the future after having piled up net debt of Rs 33,600 crore.

It plans to raise around Rs 4,000 crore through stake sales by the end of current fiscal. This, along with higher earning from airport division after recent tariff revision, is expected to help GMR Infrastructure report profits next fiscal.

GMR Infrastructure, which operates India's largest airport in New Delhi, posted a consolidated net loss of 94 crore for the quarter ended June 2012, up from Rs 67 crore a year ago, due to higher tax paid by the company and losses incurred by Delhi airport and power divisions. The group plans to divest up to 21 per cent stake in GMR Infrastructure, which will bring down the promoter holding to 51 per cent. ""We do not have any specific target but we do not intend to go below 51 per cent at any point of time,"" Subbarao said. ""If we get appropriate price we will seriously consider the option. However, stake dilution will happen in tranches,"" he added.

The company's energy segment, which posted 156 per cent jump in its net loss at Rs 27 crore last quarter, is also scouting for investors to meet equity requirement of the ongoing power project and let private equity investors exit. The company requires Rs 1,500 crore equity to fund ongoing power projects over the next two year.

""We have an option of divesting up to 26 per cent at energy vertical through strategic investment, or bring investor at project level. We may also look at exiting projects like Island Power if required,"" Subbarao said.

GMR is also willing to divest up to 15 per cent stake in its Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils to a strategic investor.

The company is also in talks with investors to sell up to 74 per cent stake in its toll-based projects. Currently, road division contributes one-tenth of GMR's annual revenues. GMR Highways business has six toll- and four annuity-based projects either completed or under construction.

""NHAI allows us to divest majority stake at project level, if investors want controlling stake and meet our objectives we are open to hit,"" Subbarao said. ""We expect to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore through stake sale and will use it to meet equity requirement of Kishangarh-Udaipur-Ahmedabad road project,"" he added.

	 
Subbarao said the company is looking at asset light and right strategy for future projects. It now plans to pick up minority stake in infrastructure projects, run these for two-three years and exit with a premium. It may also look at owning majority stake in projects that have enough cash flow and do not require equity infusion.

GMR's debt has increased to Rs 32,900 crore in 2011-12 from Rs 3,700 crore five years earlier, according to a recent report by global financial service firm Credit Suisse."
Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gold-schemes-by-pm-modi-right-in-time-to-celebrate-dhanteras-d-k-aggarwal/articleshow/49697871.cms,m.economictimes.com,Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,"By D K Aggarwal
 
 Apart from physical gold, this Dhanteras – the gold and silver buying festival – one can also avail the benefit of investing into the recently-launched three gold-related schemes, including India gold coin bearing the Ashok Chakra (available in denominations of 5 gm and 10 gm), gold monetisation, and sovereign gold bond.
 
 Importantly, instead of buying gold in physical form, investors can now park their money in bonds that are backed by gold. The idea behind launching gold monetisation schemes (GMS) is to tap household gold, which has been estimated to be of around 22,000 tonnes.
 
 Moreover, the recently-launched sovereign bond scheme would offer the same benefits as physical gold and can be used as collateral for loans and can also be traded on stock exchanges.
 
 At the time of selling, customers can earn returns as per the current price of gold. This scheme would help shift part of the estimated 300 tonnes of physical gold, which is purchased every year (in the form of gold bars and coins) in the country for investment.
 
 At the same time, it will relieve investors of the need to check the quality of gold and with valuation. Gold monetisation would help individual to earn up to 2.50 per cent interest rate on their idle gold. Investors can invest for medium term (between 5 and 7 years) as well as long term (12-15 years tenure).
 
 This initiative is likely to increase the productivity of the commercial banks as well as of the NBFCs. NBFCs are authorised to collect the application form and submit in banks and post offices.
 
 It is expected that with the launch of these schemes, India would be able to check its current account deficit (CAD). Actually, Indians are obsessed with the physical gold and India has suppressed China in case of its appetite for it. To note, India’s current account deficit stood a record $190 billion in 2013.
 
 This has prompted the then UPA government to hike import duty on it to a record 10 per cent. The efforts of government have helped India to import an estimated $34 billion of gold during the year 2014-15 much lesser then the previously imported.
 
 To note, India is the world’s top gold consumer. It is in 10th position among the top 10 countries that hold the most gold in their central banks; the Reserve Bank of India holds 557.7 tonnes of the precious metal.

Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/income-tax-department-lens-on-rs-5-lakh-crore-share-sales-by-india-inc/articleshow/34394326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,"MUMBAI: More than 5,000 closely held companies will come under the glare of the income tax department for transferring funds through suspicious share-sale deals. According to information compiled by the tax office, about Rs 5 lakh crore changed hands in past six years as 26,000-odd unlisted firms belonging to large and mid-sized corporate houses transferred funds by issuing equity and preference shares at high premiums.
 
 Tax officers believe that as much as 25% of these transactions may not be genuine. They have come across deals where equity shares having a face value of Rs 1 were sold to another entity at a premium of Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 10 shares were issued at a premium of Rs 49 lakh, said a source aware of the ongoing I-T investigation.
 
 
Many share sale deals defy logic
 
 In two cases, involving the same corporate group, three shares of Rs 10 each were offered at a premium of more than Rs 100 crore a share. “There are many such deals that defy logic and it will be difficult for companies with little activity and capital of few lakhs to justify the premium,” said a government official.
 
 On April 25, ET had reported that the tax department, in a directive issued a day before the fiscal closing, questioned hundreds of companies on the premium collected against the sale of shares. The companies have been told to justify the premiums, failing which the amount would be treated as income and therefore taxed. The 26,000 cases relate to companies based in Maharashtra. More firms will be covered with the department’s offices in some of the northern states initiating similar procedures.
 

 Corporate groups often use their unlisted arms to enter into such transactions either to generate cash or convert unexplained cash into income. Say, entity A needs Rs 5 crore cash for a property deal or to arrange a payoff. While it has the money, it fears withdrawing the amount from bank would alert tax authorities. Instead, it strikes a deal with B, which has cash and is looking for a way to legitimise it. B issues shares to A, receives Rs 5 crore through official banking channels and pays A the amount in cash. Such deals are also used to
 
 bring back funds that may have earlier been siphoned out from a company. But three senior tax professionals ET spoke to said that such cases are unlikely to exceed 5% of total transactions. The department, according to them, has rattled many companies by putting a question mark on bona fide transactions such as issuance of shares to joint venture partners, promoters and financial investors.
 
 “Fewer shares with higher premium are also issued to keep the authorised capital low and reduce fees paid to the Registrar of Companies,” said one of the tax practitioners. The particular section in the law that empowers the department to demand taxes on unjustified premiums came into effect on April 1, 2013. But based on the Bombay High Court ruling in the case Major Metals Ltd versus Union of India, the department maintains that it has the power to tax cases related to unjustified premiums even prior to this date.
 
 According to the department, in a case where the share premium charged is in excess of their intrinsic valuation, there is ground for invoking the provisions of Section 68 of the Income-Tax Act, which requires the assessee to explain not only the ‘source’ of the credit entry but also its ‘nature’. The assessments that have been reopened pertain to those in 2008-09, which would have become time-barred after March 31, 2014. But the department is collecting data for subsequent years as well."
Infusion of additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders: Barclays,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/an-extra-1-trillion-to-indias-gdp-by-2020-makes-midcaps-hot-say-experts/articleshow/50090410.cms,m.economictimes.com,"An extra $1 trillion to India's GDP by 2020 makes midcaps hot, say experts","NEW DELHI: Consumption might become one of the biggest themes to track in the next 4-5 years, thanks to the government's reform push, feel experts. A renewed thrust to capital spending, they say, could add up to $1 trillion to India's GDP in the next 4-5 years.  	According to a report by Barclays, urban spending, reforms such as GST and government capital expenditure are all set to boost consumption.  	Midcaps are likely to benefit more out of the spending push.  	""The pay panel hike and One Rank One Pay (OROP) will aid consumer spend going forward, which could lead to infusion of an additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders,"" Barclays said.  	For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets  	The S&P BSE Midcap index rose over 4 per cent so far in 2015 compared to an over 7 per cent fall in the S&P BSE Sensex. Most of the midcaps stocks have pared gains but are still trading with gains of up to 70 per cent recorded in the last one year.  	Some of the midcaps that outperformed both Sensex, and BSE Midcap index include names such as Ashok Leyland (up 75%), Bajaj Finance (up 70%), 3M India (up 69%), Wockhardt (up 63%), and Britannia Industries (up 60%).  	""There are lot many opportunities in mid-cap space in various sectors, I am not denying that and these are completely bottom up opportunities in terms of sectors or in terms of companies themselves,"" said Parag Thakkar, Head-Institutional Sales, HDFC Securities.  	A large part of the success in the rally of midcap stocks can be attributed to domestic mutual funds that have poured in close to Rs 90,000 crore so far in the year 2015.  	According to the report, inflows in equity MFs in November stood at Rs 6,300 crore with AUM in the category rising by 1.5 per cent to a new high of Rs 4,03,000 crore.  	""If the trend continues of money coming into domestic funds, which have seen for the last 15 months or so then I suspect the mid-caps will continue to do well, because many of the mutual funds are quite adapt at finding the right ideas and putting money in mid-caps,"" said Sanjeev Prasad, Kotak Institutional Equities.  	""FPI investors typically look at large caps and as of now the indications are that you would not see too much of fresh money coming into emerging market funds but these things can always reverse,"" he added.  	While choosing which midcap stocks to invest, Prasad is of the view that investors should look buying stocks based on bottom-up analysis, and whether the stock price justifies the fundamentals at given point of time.  	Midcaps stocks usually perform well when economy is growing, and when public as well as private spending increases. But, additional funds up to $1trillion will certainly be beneficial for some of midcap names.  	Although, it is difficult to put a timeline as to when this amount of money will be come into India's GDP, but experts see it happening by the year 2020.  	""It will be difficult to precisely know when $1trillion will be added in the economy because of various developmental initiatives taken by the government, but by 2020 addition of $1 trillion looks achievable,"" said Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities.   	""Though, we believe pay commission effects will be just incremental as the payout this time will be staggered, but GST will bring in break through and cause far reaching changes in the economy.

Deven Choksey: It is possible that the de-allocation of JSPL could create disruption in their business. However, there is a possibility that instead of completely de-allocating and making the company suffer on the business front, they may probably go for the revised policy which may be an auction route in which the company may end up paying a little higher price but not asked to completely surrender the coal blocks. 

 Since we do not have clarity on this subject as yet, I would refrain from making any further comments on it. If the situation I mentioned earlier permits their economic value, it should not affect JSPL beyond a point."

Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/meera-sanyal-to-quit-royal-bank-of-scotland-for-a-full-time-career-in-politics/articleshow/19467763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,"MUMBAI: Meera Sanyal, the 51-year old banker who stunned political observers and bankers alike by contesting the South Mumbai constituency against Milind Deora in 2009, is hanging up her boots to plunge into political life ahead of the forthcoming general elections.
	
	The daughter of late Vice Admiral G Hiranandani, a gallantry award winner and author of works on Indian naval history, will quit as the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, India, to involve in socio-political life full time, said two people familiar with the matter. It is not known whether Sanyal, a member of the Indian Liberal Group, would join any political party.
	
	Sanyal, a fan of Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, shot into fame when she filed nomination papers to contest against Deora, son of Congress politician and former minister of Petroleum Murli Deora. She lost the elections in 2009, but not the spirit. She got 10,157 votes, or about 1.6 per cent of the total polled. Deora won. She chose to contest elections following dismay at the response of the authorities to the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 which killed 164 people and set the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi on fire.
	
	Sanyal, who had said that she had given a quarter century of her life to banking, will give the next quarter century to political life, could not be reached for comment.
	
	“Meera H Sanyal is relinquishing her executive responsibilities as Country Executive, to devote herself more fully to the social, economic and political causes in India, that she is passionate about,” a statement from RBS said. “We are in the process of finalising an external successor for this role and will announce that person in due course.” Meera will continue to chair the India Services Executive Committee and the RBS India Foundation.
	
	Some in the industry welcome her decision to jump to political life. “It’s terrific,"" said said Jamal Mecklai, CEO, Mecklai Financial Services. “The truth is India will not get anywhere unless educated people enter politics. A governance revolution has been ignited in India and she’s put her hat in the ring. I hope this inspires other people as well.""
	
	Born on October 15, 1961, Sanyal had her school education in Mumbai and New Delhi. Unlike many management aspirants who head to the US, she travelled to France to complete her management education from Insead. When she nearly gave up on job hunt and was about to return to the West, she had an offer from Grindlays Bank which led to a near three decade of banking career.

	 

	
	
	In 1992 she joined ABN Amro, that was acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland, and served in many departments including administration when she introduced hiring people with different abilities and weaker sections, though on merit. “She is cerebral, articulate and a sharp person,"" says a former colleague now with a rival who did not want to be identified. “Meera was always responsible for the administrative function. People who work under have good things to say.""
	Although she has not shared her political thought in public, given her background and her tweets, she may be closer to the liberal economic philosophy, than a welfare state approach.
	
	The Thatcher era comes to an end! Rest in peace Maggie - you reformed & liberalised politics & economics for an entire generation,'' Sanyal tweeted after the Britain's Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher died on Monday.
	
	Sanyal was also convenor of the Indian Liberal Group, an association of people with liberal thoughts, founded by Minoo Masani, especially when it comes to economic policies opposing Congress party's statist policies.
	
	Her commitment to policies may be strong, but to be politically successful in the poor dominated system, she may have to change her ways if she has to succeed.
	
	She'll have to lose those pearls first,'' said writer Shobha De before the 2009 elections. And switch to earthy, home spun salwar kameezes before that. But how on earth will she communicate her objectives to a constituency that has been spoilt and nurtured over decades by politicos with pockets as deep as the ocean?''"

A week ago, it had mobilised Rs 1,500 crore by offering the same securities.
 
 “We have got approval for Rs 3,769 crore collectively this year, and are raising it in two tranches as we did not collect the full amount in the first issue,” a senior company official told ET, confirming the second tranche of fund raising.
 
 The bonds will open for bidding on Wednesday as the coupon rate is expected to be fixed above 10-15 basis points higher than the benchmark government bonds.
 
 
 “The fixed spread finalised in the bidding process will be added to the average of two weeks' benchmark sovereign bonds estimated at 8.19%,” said an investment banker familiar with the matter, but didn't wish to be named.
 
 This means, the annualised yield could be at 8.50-8.51% compared with 8.41% in the earlier issue. MTNL securities are rated triple-A (Structured Obligation) by rating companies Crisil and Care.
 
 Structured Obligation signifies the government guarantee, which can be invoked when the issuer defaults in interest repayments.
 
 “The spread between the sovereign and government-guaranteed corporate bonds has contracted significantly to 10-20 bps from about 60 bps last year. This has helped issuers in terms of cost of borrowings,” said Ajay Manglunia, head -fixed income, Edelweiss Securities.
 
 “FIIs, which almost exhausted their investment limit in the G-Secs, are now investing in these securities.”
 
 Last week, FCI bonds slipped two bps below the similar government bonds on higher demand from overseas investors but later corrected a bit. Bond yields and prices move in opposite direction.
 
 MTNL, Food Corporation of India and Air India are three bond issuers who are in the same league, with all of them enjoying a sovereign guarantee status.
 
 Despite not being in the best of financial health, overseas investors rush to lap up these securities as they treat them as quasi-government securities.
 
 Earlier, big investors like HSBC, JPMorgan were seen investing in such issues."
OVL to raise up to $1 billion via dollar issue to fund Azerbaijan buy,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ovl-to-raise-up-to-1-billion-via-dollar-issue-to-fund-azerbaijan-buy/articleshow/19353229.cms,m.economictimes.com,OVL to raise up to $1 billion via dollar issue to fund Azerbaijan buy,"NEW DELHI: ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), on Tuesday said it aims to raise up to $1 billion through a dollar issue this month to fund its recent acquisition in Azerbaijan. 

 OVL last week concluded a $1.001 billion deal to buy US energy major Hess Corp's 2.7% stake in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in Azerbaijan, and 2.4% of the associated BTC pipeline. 

 ""It makes sense to raise cheaper debt through overseas bond issuance,"" OVL Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event here. The company had initially planned to issue its maiden overseas bond between January and March, but delayed it to complete the acquisition. 

 He said refinancing was easier since all of OVL's assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars. 

 The company, which gets most of its funds from its parent firm, has already appointed merchant bankers for raising the debt, a source said. ""There is no doubt that dollar debt is cheaper than rupee borrowings,"" he said. 

 The Azerbaijan acquisition was OVL's biggest since 2009 when it bought UK-listed, Russia-focused Imperial Energy for $2.1 billion. 

 ACG, which is located in the south Caspian Sea, about 95 km off the coast of Azerbaijan, is the largest oil and gas field complex in Azerbaijan and one of the largest producing oil fields in the world."
Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/quick-heal-may-be-indias-first-pure-software-co-to-take-the-ipo-route/articleshow/31860061.cms,m.economictimes.com,Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,"MUMBAI: A decade ago, it took Quick Heal time and hard work to convince software giant Microsoft that the small Indian outfit was serious about the business of building anti-virus software.
 
 Since then, Quick Heal, which started out as a gadget repair shop, has risen to become an IPO prospect, travelling a path that was far from easy. When they file their draft red herring prospectus in December, they might well be the first pure software products company from India to list, although others such as Mumbai-listed Persistent Systems build software for global customers.
 
 In 1990, Kailash Katkar, who says he barely passed his matriculation, started a calculator and computer repair shop with 15,000 from his savings. His younger brother Sanjay Katkar was studying computer science at an engineering college, and was working on an anti-virus project and often came to practice on the shop's computer.
 
 ""We noticed that every time Sanjay came, the computer would work properly and if he had not come for sometime there would be lots of problems. So, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just running these programmes he had created to clean out the viruses,"" said Kailash Katkar.
 
 That was how Quick Heal was born. The company initially sold the software along with annual maintenance contracts, a business that Katkar kept active until 1999 to fund the anti-virus business. ""When we started we couldn't get any money from banks. No one wanted to trust us. Now, they keep chasing us and we have to tell them that we don't need money,"" said Kailash, who is the CEO of the company, with his brother Sanjay taking on the role of chief technology officer.
 
 Quick Heal started at a time when there was no software product from India and little if any venture capital activity. The company received its first venture capital funding in 2010 from Sequoia, the same firm that recently boasted of nearly $3-billion payday from its investment in mobile messaging service, WhatsApp. Sequoia put in Rs 60 crore into Quick Heal, valuing the Pune-based company at Rs 600 crore at the time. That valuation has only grown in the last two years.
 
 
 

 
 ""The minimum they could expect is a Rs 1,200-crore valuation. It could be much more, depending on their actual numbers,"" said an investment banker, who declined to be identified. ""Product firms are rare but they are typically given a valuation of some multiples of revenue, but there is currently no benchmark for a company like Quick Heal in India,"" the banker said.
 
 The lack of a benchmark worries the Katkars, who are currently in the process of appointing independent directors and consultants to determine a valuation for the company. However, other IPOs such as the one for Just Dial have increased Quick Heal's confidence in its plans."
Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/reserve-bank-of-india-changes-in-gilt-auctions-seen-as-sign-of-stable-rates/articleshow/39221348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,"A couple of moves by the RBI while announcing Friday's auction for government securities (G-secs) has surprised the bond market.
 
 But dealers and analysts said that the indications, taken together, signify that the central bank is expecting a stable interest rate, at least over the next 12-18 months.
 
 On Monday , RBI announced that it will auction another lot of the new 10year paper, 8.40% GS 2024, worth Rs 9,000 crore, making it the second consecutive week of auctioning the same paper. This is probably the first time RBI has decided to auction the same paper over two successive weeks. The central bank has also moved from an uniform price auction to multiple price auction method for this Friday .
 
 Dealers said that the current yield on the new 10-year, which will be the new benchmark rate for the market, is at 8.43% per annum. In contrast, the old 10-year, which was the benchmark till last Friday , is trading at a yield of 8.71%. Ideally , the two benchmarks should not have such a large variation which at present is nearly 30 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point). “With more supply of the new 10-year in Friday's auction, this distortion will be corrected soon,“ a top dealer with a domestic bond house said.
 
 The RBI decision is also expected to increase the lifecycle of the new 10-year gilt and also the current 14-year.
 
 In all likelihood, the next 10year will be introduced only after eight-nine months, dealers said. Usually , RBI introduces two 10-year papers every year to indicate the benchmark rate that it is comfortable with. “If the RBI is extending the lifecycle of a 10-year, it is probably (another) indication that rates will be stable and hence it will not tweak with the benchmark paper,“ the dealer said.
 
 During auctions, usually the central bank also uses the uniform price method which ensures bond buyers get the gilts in the auction at an uniform yield. On the other hand, in multiple price auctions, while bidding bond houses should be more careful about the price they are willing to pay . By changing the bidding method, RBI is indicating bond players to be very careful about rates going forward, bond market players said."
Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-investors-should-assign-60-weightage-to-large-cap-stocks-in-their-portfolio-experts/articleshow/45759550.cms,m.economictimes.com,Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex, which rose 30 per cent in the calendar year 2014, looks all set to touch fresh record highs in the year 2015 and large cap stocks are likely to lead the rally, say experts.

For the year 2014, the Sensex outperformed with annual return of 30 per cent, whereas FD rates were 9 per cent and gold gave negative returns. There are typically five asset classes to choose from for retail investors, namely - equities, gold, fixed income, currency and commodities.

Equities as an asset class is likely to outperform other asset classes in the year 2015 and retail investors should look at buying quality stocks on every dip.

""For retail investors our advice is to invest wisely in equities, in 60:40 ratio - with 60% of portfolio to be assigned for large caps and 40% for mid-caps,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.

""In the year 2015 we are expecting good returns in the mid cap sector, but as risk is high, we cannot put high stakes on it. It is best to concentrate on solid stocks with great long-term growth potential and use the strategy of buying in dips,"" adds Gupta.

He further adds that mutual funds can also be a great option if direct market participation is not feasible or in case there is less risk appetite.

Considering the fact that equities are likely to outperform other asset classes, investors should remain cautious while picking stocks for their portfolio. One can look for a company that offers unique products or has a foothold in a niche market.

Consider stocks that are fundamentally solid - a strong cash position, little or no long-term debt, growing revenues, ongoing profitability, and a good growth strategy, say experts. It is also good to look for stocks that return income to investors in the form of a share repurchase program and dividends.

""Equities as an asset class are much more likely to outperform the other asset classes. Fixed income investments are being peddled by many on the basis that the RBI will cut interest rates and hence one should invest in them to capture the one-time upside to the principal,"" says Dr Vikas V Gupta, Executive Vice President at ArthVeda Fund Management Pvt. Ltd.

""However, go into equities with a consciousness of your own risk appetite and allocate a portion for the long-term. Start with a reasonable lump-sum of about 10-20 per cent of your financial corpus and then add SIPs so that in 6 months you have about 30% of the financial corpus,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that one should stick to index-oriented funds and safer large cap strategies. Small and midcaps also have a role in investors’ portfolio, but to a lesser extent.


	 

Experts across Dalal Street advise investors that they should not chase past returns; i.e. since BSE Small Cap has given 100% returns in the last one year, so one should not get enticed that that will continue in the future.

It is expected that 30 per cent CAGR in EPS is possible over the next 5 years, according to our market analysis, says Gupta. This is likely to provide very high returns over the next 5 years.

However, retail investors should develop their own understanding of equities and read up Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor before jumping lock-stock-and-barrel into equities, advise experts.

""As far as retail investors are concerned, the current set-up of Indian equity markets is unprecedented. The next three-five years look very good from the corporate growth and return perspective,"" says Vikas Khemani, Edelweiss Financial Services.

""People have to invest in equities. You can have a systematic investment plan. Obviously, one has to look at one’s own risk-reward profile. But in my opinion, for every retail investor, equity exposure has to be a significant part of their savings pool,"" he adds.

Khemani is of the view that at least 15% to 20% return over the next four-five years will come from equities. And the best part is that it is also tax free. So, equities are definitely a great asset class for any retail investor, he concludes."

ET Now: The dollar strength going past 89. What is your view on the rupee? 

 
Manoj Rane: The rupee is one of the few currencies which has held up during this bout of dollar strengthening. We have seen about a 3 per cent depreciation from a 60 level. It is nothing compared to what where the Yen is today. It is almost 120 and the euro is 1.23. So you have seen 10 to 15 per cent depreciation against the dollar for other currencies. In fact INR is one of the currencies which would have strengthened against most other currencies other than USD.
 
 We are so USD focus that we do react a lot to whatever weakness we see even on an intraday basis on the currency side. The good news is that 62 continues to be supported. I am not sure when I say that whether it is really good news or bad news because a certain weakness or slight weakness in the currency is in my mind good for the country, trade and our current account deficit. So to that extent I do think this level will possibly hold the currency on an around 62. I do not expect significant depreciation from here."

Anish Damania: This budget is going to drive the roadmap for the next five years. I would really like to see how the budget pans out. I want to see what the Budget does about investment expenditure. It may go about it by raising tax revenue or cutting wasteful expenditure, and allocating the amount towards investment. 

 I also want to see what the budget does about fiscal deficits and how it proposes to prime the economy. 

 These are the various steps that I am looking at. I am not comfortable with the scenario where the government will expect a higher revenue growth than the 10-11% out of the taxes. It is not going to be that easy to increase tax revenues as much as expected. So I also want to see the divestment targets of this government. I want them to be very aggressive because there is liquidity. They need to harness this global liquidity in their favour. 

 Last year, it was about Rs 276 billion. I am expecting that this year they will target close to Rs 700 billion or so in terms of divestments. I want to see those kind of numbers in the Budget. I think the areas where divestment happens are going to be the ones that will become more attractive."

  Obviously, these funds have some kind of a legacy, some kind of a credibility in the market place. If there are better names on the side of anchor investors, then one tends to feel more comfortable. A similar case applies elsewhere also. If there is a great guy getting into a particular product, you do not mind getting into it because the great guy has got it but if the hedge funds are, the ones who are becoming anchor investors and at times we also hear that these are back-to-back arrangements from the promoter group within the fund, they are IAR, which are absolutely predetermined.

"Thanks to SEBI, shareholders will have access to critical information from the next fiscal",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/thanks-to-sebi-shareholders-will-have-access-to-critical-information-from-the-next-fiscal/articleshow/16397390.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Thanks to SEBI, shareholders will have access to critical information from the next fiscal","SEBI vide its recent circular has made it mandatory for top 100 listed companies (by market capitalization) to report certain critical information as part of their business responsibility. 

 This includes how much the company is spending on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a percentage of its net profit, the number of stakeholders' complaints received and resolved, details of any pending case filed by stakeholder against any unfair trade practice, irresponsible advertising or anti-competitive behaviour adopted by the company. 

 This will enable the shareholders to have a better understanding of the manner in which their companies' function and adopt responsible business practices. 

 The circular dated August 13 exhorts the companies to follow the national voluntary guidelines on social, environmental and economic responsibility that have been formulated by ministry of corporate affairs in July 2011. 

 Companies are expected to share information like number of employees hired on temporary or contractual basis, any legal notices received from pollution control boards and number of consumer complaints pending at the end of the fiscal. 

 While most leading companies like L&T, HUL, Dr Reddy's Labs, Tata Motors, ITC and ICICI Bank are already publishing a separate sustainability report along with their annual reports, the circular will make it compulsory for all top 100 companies to report their responsibility initiatives and also bring in certain uniformity in their reporting. 

 ""It is a step in the right direction by the SEBI. However, it is not a surprise. The industry knew that something like this was coming,"" said the head of CSR division in a Nifty company. Most of the companies must be in the process of making themselves ready for such reporting. 

 If a company has to follow it, it has to start early as there has to be a system put in place and it is an initiative where the whole organization has to be involved, he added. 

 Under the structure that has been suggested, the companies also have to provide the details of the director responsible for implementation of the business responsibility policies. In case a company is not abiding by any of the principles to be reported, it has to explain the reasons of its failure to do so. 

 The Companies bill 2011, which is making it mandatory for certain companies to report their responsibility initiatives, is still pending approval from the parliament. Meanwhile SEBI through its circular has made business responsibility reporting mandatory for at least the large companies. 

 The circular shall be applicable with effect from fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2012. Sustainability experts expect the regulation to be progressively made applicable to all companies listed on the stock exchanges. The national voluntary guidelines are already applicable to all Indian companies including multinationals as well as small and medium enterprises. 

 The companies that already submit sustainability reports to their stakeholders based on internationally accepted reporting frameworks have to only map the principles contained in the national voluntary guidelines to their existing sustainability reports."

Air Indias insurance contract up for renewal on October 1 for an estimated $25 million,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/air-indias-insurance-contract-up-for-renewal-on-october-1-for-an-estimated-25-million/articleshow/43113261.cms,m.economictimes.com,Air India’s insurance contract up for renewal on October 1 for an estimated $25 million,"MUMBAI: The race for Air India’s insurance account is boiling down to a contest between the public and private sector. A consortium of state-owned insurers led, by New India Assurance, has emerged as the frontrunner for the national carrier’s business, while the private sector has rallied behind a group led by ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The insurance contract for the flag carrier’s 105-strong fleet comes up for renewal on October 1 at an estimated premium of about $25 million. 

 
Experts said the New India Assuranceled consortium has United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and National Insurance as co-insurers. The other group has ICICI Lombard General Insurance as lead insurer and Reliance General and HDFC Ergo as co-insurers. 

 The insurance companies ET spoke with on the matter declined to comment. However, a senior executive at a staterun insurer said the New India Assurance-led consortium was ahead in the race. 

 According to industry executives, aviation premiums have increased following arise in mishaps, pushing up the bill for insurers. For instance, in 2013 when the market had softened, Air India paid a premium of $23 million. This was lower by over $1 million than the premium in 2010 when an Air India Express jet crashed in Mangalore killing 158 people. 

 General insurers led by Reliance General that had provided cover to Air India in 2010 had to pay Rs 350-400 crore in compensation claims. Most of the claim money came from international reinsurers who dictate rates depending on the state of the market. 

 Air India’s current insurance policy, issued by New India Assurance, includes a $9.5-billion hull cover and a combined single liability of $1.5 billion. 

 Hull all-risk insurance covers any damage to the body of the aircraft caused by an accident, while war risk, part of hull cover, insures against war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. In addition, the insurance covers liability toward passengers and covers legal protection against suits. 

 A series of aviation disasters this year—the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in March, the crash of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft in Ukraine in July and that of an Air Algeria plane in Mali in the same month—have turned aviation insurers wary."

 The Reserve Bank of India has on Wednesday released a market borrowing calendar stating that state governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, will sell about Rs 95,000-1,05,000 crore worth of bonds between January and March next year through central bank auction system. 

 With this higher-than-expected capital market fund mop-ups, investors including insurers, pension funds would be flooded with excess supply of securities. Markets were expecting state bond sales in the range of Rs 65,000-75,000 crore in the fourth quarter. 

 “The amount of proposed bond sales is higher than market expectations,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, analyst, interest rates, SBI DFHI Primary Dealers. “The excess supply along with other securities will help future investors to earn higher.” 

 “Issuers may have to fork out higher rates to woo investors as the yield curve would remain elevated,” he said. By March, markets could also see Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore worth of ‘discom’ bonds coming out of state-owned power distribution companies under the bailout scheme christened as “Uday”. Moreover, tax free bonds are already attracting retail investors with a cumulative Rs 40,000 crore issuances expected by financial yearend. The central government too will issue about Rs 80,000-85,000 crore routine sovereign bonds between January and February, dealers said. 

 Excess supply will lead to rise in bond yields pushing prices down in the existing bonds. 

 New tax free bonds may now have to offer higher rates as those are priced in link with the benchmark bond yield. State bonds are now yielding 8.25-8.27% half yearly, which about 50 basis points higher than the benchmark sovereign yield. 

 During October-December quarter such bond sales was in the range Rs 75,000-80,000. About six months ago, for the first time, the central bank had issued a tentative calendar for selling state securities in line with central government bonds. In the July-September quarter, 10 states and one of the union territories had sold Rs 45,000-50,000 crore bonds. State bonds are mostly of 10-year maturities while states like Gujarat and Karnataka have introduced five-year papers too."

 Aydogan Cakmaz, Head - R&D at DICV, will take over as Head - R&D for Trucks Asia and will based at the MFTBC Headquarters at Kawasaki, Japan, effective July 1, 2013, the company said in a statement. 

 Cakmaz will oversee all R&D operations of Daimler Trucks for Asia. He was instrumental in the development of the BharatBenz range of trucks building in them the reliability arising out of intense testing and engineering, it added. 

 Under the recently announced Daimler Trucks Asian business model involving integration of certain key areas, the first integration involves the R&D of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck & Bus Corporation (MFTBC) (a Daimler Company), Japan. 

 Hidekazo Kanno, Head - Product Lifecycle Management at MFTBC, Japan, will take over as Head - R&D for DICV, at Chennai, effective on Monday. He will now report to Cakmaz, the company added. 

 In an other change not related to the Asian Business Model, DICV said its CFO Sanjiv Khurana will take over as President - Remanufacturing Division, Daimler Trucks North America at Portland, Oregon, USA, effective July 1 2013. 

 Khurana has completed his term at DICV. He has been with DICV since its inception. As a key member of DICV's Executive Committee and several core teams, he has contributed immensely to DICV's establishment in India, it added. 

 Subsequently, Parthasarathy Thota, Head - Light/ Medium- duty Trucks (L/MDT) Project for BharatBenz at DICV, will take over as the CFO of DICV, the company said.

Pankaj Pandey: Largely if you look at there are some segments which do well at a certain point in time and then there are certain segments which become a drag so similarly for example it looks like that metal as a pack might be a sort of a drag on the company.  	Earlier you had oil and gas which was posing challenges for the company, but largely if you look at what we are expecting is that in this particular quarter things would remain soft for the company and it is largely a soft quarter.  	But in terms of order inflows, it will be similar to what has happened in the last quarter so about 11500 odd crores that is what the company has disclosed, so we are expecting about 4 to 5% top line growth and a similar bottom line growth with same margins.  	The key takeaway going forward will be that over the next three to six months, we would expect a lot of announcements to happen on the ordering side which is where we would expect this company to do far better, which is why we would expect that probably the demand would continue to hold its guidance of 15% order growth and we are expecting a similar sort of top line growth and a shade below margin and a shade below profit growth. But overall, this is one of the best places in the overall space which is why this stock continues to be a portfolio pick."

Inox Wind’s IPO was oversubscribed 35 times. It closed at Rs 438 — 35% higher than its offer price on Thursday. Another example is of Marico Kaya, a subsidiary of Marico which was listed in July 2014. The stock has so far gained 750%. Intellect Design, a subsidiary of Polaris Consulting Services, has gained 70% since its listing in December 2014.
 
 Spinning off the less profitable business once it turns around and becomes self-sustainable not only creates value for the shareholders of the new listed entity but also for the shareholders of the parent company. ETIG has identified some of the companies that may see a potential separate listing of the smaller or less profitable businesses.
 
 
Eicher Motors
 
 For Eicher Motors, separate listing of its commercial vehicle business could be a game changer. The bike business may be around one-third of the top-line, but contributed 90% to the entire profit in CY14. According to analysts, the bike business will grow at least 60% for the next two years (it grew by 100% in CY14) and should get a P/E multiple of 25 on FY17 earnings.
 
 This means, the bike business on a standalone basis is valued at Rs 36,000 crore. Considering this, the commercial vehicle business is valued at only Rs 6,500 crore (the current market capitalisation of Rs 42,500 crore lessRs 36,000 crore of bike business valuation). The commercial vehicle business, which is a joint venture with Swedish auto giant Volvo, gives two-thirds of Eicher’s total sales and has already started to show a turnaround.
 
 

HSIL
 
 HSIL is the biggest player in the sanitary ware business with close to 60% market share and the highest margin in the industry. But, it has a market capitalisation less than its peer – Cera Sanitaryware. This is because HSIL also has a glass business which was loss-making till a few quarters ago with a debt of close to Rs 800 crore.
 
 In the glass packaging business it is one of the top two players in the country. It became loss-making two years ago after the industry capacity increased amid the demand slowdown. However, now the glass industry has consolidated with only few players and the demand is improving. HSIL’s glass business has shown a strong turnaround. The recent institutional placement will bring down the debt significantly. In the past, the management has mentioned about demerging the two businesses.
 
 
Tata Global Beverages
 
 Since the time Tata Global Beverages and Starbucks signed the joint venture in India, Tata Global Beverages’ market capitalisation has remained almost stagnant. Analysts are not giving the full valuation to the Starbucks business, which has already opened close to 70 stores and 70% of that in the last one year.
 
 The company is expected to have 400 Starbucks outlets by FY18 and achieve breakeven. Once that happens, there could be a separate listing of Starbucks. Jubilant FoodWorks with close to 800 stores is valued at over Rs 10,000 crore and Tata Global Beverages together with its tea, coffee and Starbucks businesses is valued at Rs 9,300 crore."

 Nasdaq’s entry into the India market comes at a time when the US-based stock exchange is looking to expand its footprint in emerging markets including India. Industry insiders believe that the exchange is hoping to cash-in on the optimism fueling the technology sector and get manystart-ups access capital by helping them get listed at the stock market. 

 ""We look forward to the long-term opportunities our presence in Bangalore will provide for us,"" said Robert Frojd, regional manager, Southeast Asia for NASDAQ OMX. 

 Details of the management at the India office were not mentioned in the press release. An email was sent to the Nasdaq this morning, before US working hours. 

 Nasdaq first opened its Bangalore office in 2001 and was present until the year 2009. However, in the eight years Nasdaq was present on the ground, the exchange could not get any Indian firm listed on its stock exchange, according to data from Dealogic and the Nasdaq’s website. 

 This was primarily because experts believed there very few incentives for the companies to get listed, with the problems getting exacerbated by the the many regulatory bottlenecks ahead of the India firms to get listed in the US. 

 However, this time many believe the exchange could find success and get firms access to capital as the exchange may have learnt from its mistakes during the first stint. 

 Kiran Karnik, a former president of India’s software industry association body Nasscom said the decision to set up an office in India, after having gone through a turmoil, is an optimistic step. 

 ""For startups in Bangalore, especially the one’s that are growing fast, this is a great opportunity to get to Nasdaq,"" he said. 

 Over the past few years, Nasdaq has been expanding its presence beyond the US and European markets by wooing listings from companies in Southeast Asia. It has listed 8 Indian companies, including pharmaceutical firm Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, ICICI Bank and Sify Technologies . 

 India’s second largest software firm Infosys had moved its listing from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext's New York Stock Exchange in 2012 to increase its access to European investors. Infosys was replaced by Facebook on the Nasdaq-100 index."

Investors have invited banks to pitch for the mandate this week, said two people close to the development. 

 On the back of growing investor demand for financial services companies, the promoters see an IPO as the best option to raise capital. If the company files for an IPO, it will become the first sizeable nonbanking financial company (NBFC) to list in the last four years. 

 Founded in 2010 by Everstone Capital, Indostar provides long term funding to Indian businesses and infrastructure projects. ""The presentations from bankers will be made this week. A few banks will be appointed soon,"" said one of the persons. 

 ""Apart from four global banks, a couple of domestic banks will be appointed. The issue is expected to be launched around June 2016,"" said the second person. 

 Everstone Capital managing partner Dhanpal Jhaveri declined to comment. 

 Last year, Ashmore Capital, one of the founding partners of Indostar, exited the business by selling its stake to Everstone Capital and ACPI. Apart from Everstone and Goldman Sachs, Indostar is owned by Beacon India Private Equity Fund, ACPI and China Development Finance's investment arm CDIB. 

 Indostar's loan portfolio stood at Rs 3,375 crore on 31 March, according to an October ratings release by Care India. The company's net worth is more than Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Having focused on wholesale lending, the company is now increasingly looking at small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to diversify its loan portfolio. On March 31, around 30 per cent of loans were to the real estate sector, 66.5 per cent to corporate financing and 2.9 per cent was given out against shares. The company's vehicle finance portfolio was 0.2 per cent of the total. This is one reason why Indostar is able to maintain a healthy portfolio with gross nonperforming assets at 0.77 per cent and net non-performing assets at 0.064 per cent of total loans, experts said. 

 Indostar clocked around Rs 149 crore in post-tax profit in FY15, up from Rs 112 crore in the previous year. This growth was achieved on the back of total income of Rs 528 crore."

ET Now: What is your take on the auto stocks? How are you dissecting the game between four-wheelers and two-wheelers? Between four-wheelers too, it is a divide between CVs and passenger vehicles. Your thoughts? 

 
Rajat Rajgarhia: The top stocks in auto right now are very clear. They are Maruti and Tata Motors. As of Maruti — while the stock is at its all-time high — the volumes have been almost flat for the last four years. We think that over the next three-four years when the volume moves from the current 1.2 million to close to 2 million, the operating leverage along with a stable currency can do wonders to its earnings, and similarly, to the stock. 

 Same is the case with Tata Motors. JLR continues to hold on well, but the domestic business has been a drag. It will return with a big bang over the years to come. It means not just a higher earnings, but also a higher valuation for the stock. 

 M&M has also reported the July month volumes, with both UVs and tractors showing a decline. At this point of time, it would definitely not be on the priority list, because we will have to see how, at what point of time, both of their businesses start doing well. Generally the stock will only do well when you will see both these units growing into double digits. But that is not happening anytime in the near future. 

 To me, both Tata Motors and Maruti will keep on dragging for some more time."
"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-move-on-fast-track-rights-fpos-to-help-government-in-disinvestment-of-state-owned-companies/articleshow/42843402.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies","MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi is planning to allow more listed companies to raise funds through ‘fast track’ follow-on public offers (FPOs) and rights issues, provided issuers fulfil certain conditions. The proposed move could also make it easier for the government to divest stake in some of the state-owned companies.
 
 Companies having a free-float market capitalisation above Rs 250 crore will be able take this route, according to a regulatory official. This will make more than 300 listed companies eligible for the fast track fundraising option. Apart from meeting existing criteria, companies will also have to fulfil additional conditions – like, promoters will have to compulsorily subscribe to rights entitlement, the stock should not have been suspended from trading in the past three years due to regulatory violations, no conflict of interest should prevail between lead manager and issuer and promoters, and the company should not have settled any violation of securities law through consent mechanism.
 
 The regulator is keen to further reduce the time for processing offer documents for companies with good track record. At present, compliant listed companies satisfying certain specific conditions and having a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore are allowed to access the primary market in a time effective manner. Such companies can proceed with FPOs and rights issue by filing a copy of prospectus with stock exchanges and Sebi. They are not required to file draft offer document for Sebi comments.
 
 What is now being proposed is making rules simpler for a larger number of companies. “The fast track route will significantly shorten the fund-raising process for companies,” said Praveen Chakarvarty, a member of Sebi’s primary market advisory committee and former managing director of BNP Paribas.
 
 “Typically, for a company wishing to raise money through an FPO or rights issue (with Sebi review), the timeline is about 5-7 months, which is very long in the current environment,” said Sudhir Bassi, executive director-capital markets of the law firm Khaitan & Co. “In order to make FPO and rights issue more popular modes of raising funds by corporates, it would be useful if Sebi relaxes the eligibility requirements for fast track issuers.”
 
 The new rule on fast track issuances is expected to cover all PSUs, irrespective of their market capitalisation – a step that could facilitate the government's divestment programme. On the proposal on making it incumbent on promoters to subscribe to their rights entitlement, Chakarvarty said, “This is in line with international investing practices.”
 
 In 2012, the regulator had reduced the threshold of free-float market capitalisation for issuers accessing the market through fast-track FPOs and rights issues to Rs 3,000 crore from Rs 5,000 crore. Sebi had introduced the concept of fast track issues in 2007. The regulator is not in favour of making the fast track route available to all companies as the process involves restricted due diligence.
 
 But some experts feel all publicly traded companies should be able to avail this facility. “All listed companies should be allowed to use the fast track route. However, to be on the conservative side, the current threshold of market cap should definitely be lowered,” said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database. “If a company is already listed and trading is taking place on a daily basis, then there is enough information available in the public domain… why, then, should an FPO or rights issue require a detailed offer document and a Sebi approval?”"

 In case it does not happen, we will cut off the short position on Monday morning. But the weekly view is quite positive. The pattern till now suggests at most a small correction of 100 points. At those levels we would want to go long. 

 I would want to be stock-specific. So if the Nifty finds support at 7430-7400 levels, then I would look at covering a short position and going long, stressing on playing stock-specific."
Valuations do not warrant fresh buying in Britannia; existing investors should stay put: Mayuresh Joshi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/valuations-do-not-warrant-fresh-buying-in-britannia-existing-investors-should-stay-put-mayuresh-joshi/articleshow/48373712.cms,m.economictimes.com,Valuations do not warrant fresh buying in Britannia; existing investors should stay put: Mayuresh Joshi,"In a chat with ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking, shares his top investment ideas.
 
 
ET Now: You are positive on Britannia Industries and, in the past, you have liked the stock at Rs 3,100 level. Is Britannia price to perfection?  Mayuresh Joshi: Britannia Industries' valuations are close to 36-odd times FY17 earnings. We believe that it should continue to remain a part of portfolio on few counts. The return on capital (ROC) has showed tremendous improvement from lower levels to around 54 per cent.
 
 The return on equity (ROE) too is at a very decent level at 50 per cent-odd. If you look at the cash convergence cycle, the company is sitting on decent cash at the current juncture. In addition, the cost optimisation efforts that the company is probably taking to margin expansion, I am not of the opinion that the margins would stay at 14-14.5 per cent.
 
 The numbers have been aided by too many factors in the June quarter results. So, low raw material, freight and fuel costs have probably propped up margins. But decent margin expansion has to happen with the cost optimisation plan and premiumisation story — the cookie market — that will still play out. So, in my opinion, investors who have bought the stock at lower levels should continue holding on to it for 10 years though valuations at the current juncture do not warrant a fresh buy at the current level."

Mitesh Thacker: So on the market, you have probably defined the range. The broader range is still about 8,050-8,100 on the upside to about 7,700. Today morning, I talked about the possibility of bounce back happening given the fact that Nifty was on the hourly closing charts, closer to about 7,700-7,690 which was the earlier swing low. The Bank Nifty was at important weekly pivot levels of around 16,200. The bounceback has started. I was expecting it to be choppy bounce back but this appears to be slightly stronger than what my initial expectation was.
 
 You might see a subdued move in the coming one or two days around 7,850 but, overall the next level on the upside should be around 7,925 to about 7,950. With some choppiness in the next two-three sessions or four sessions we might be trading around 7,950-odd levels."

ET Now: What are your thoughts on real estate sector?  N Jayakumar: Everything is a function of the price at which it is trading and real estate has come off quite dramatically. Most of these stocks are quoting very close to what is the equivalent of book. Three months ago there was no off take in the same real-estate. To a large extent that has changed and things are happening at least in metros. In places like Mumbai, South Delhi and Gurgaon there is a fair amount of activity happening which has allowed the real-estate companies to monetise some of their assets.  So, as companies like DLF and Unitech continues to monetise their land banks and keep reducing their debt then there will be a scenario where some of these companies regardless of the external environment will find a base at current levels and could surprise on the upside as liquidity and interest rates ease off in April-May.  ET Now: Would banks be a good bet to put your money in?  N Jayakumar: Banks are the first space that get affected by interest rates. Evaluations and the bond yields are indicating that somewhere along the line the markets are sensing a cut in interest rates and that might be a force cut in interest rates but it will need to have an impact that brings in further rate cuts.  We are far far aggressively placed in terms of interest rates right now which is only hurting growth. Somewhere along the line the RBI will have to cut rates and the banks therefore will bounce-off their lows pretty aggressively indicating further rate cuts. My own sense is that the downside is limited but there could be upsides evolving even from here. Private sectors banks like Yes Bank given their lower propensity to have NPAs will actually be much bigger beneficiaries than the public sector banks.

  Naik currently holds the position of Chairman and MD at the group, a major player in engineering, manufacturing, construction and a host of other businesses including technology and financial services.
  
  The L&T's board of directors has decided to bifurcate the roles of Chairman and Managing Director in a major top management rejig, which would become effective from April 1.
  
  As per the new structure, Venkataraman would assume the position of Chief Executive Officer and MD, while Naik would assume the post of Executive Chairman.
  
  Krishnamurthi Venkataramanan is currently Whole-time Director and President (Hydrocarbon) and had joined L&T as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in 1969. He was elevated to L&T Board in the year 1995.
  
  ""I am pleased that the board has appointed K Venkataraman as CEO & MD. I have full confidence that under Venkataraman's leadership, L&T will continue on its growth path,"" Naik said. MORE PTI SP BJ SA 03091117 NNNN
  
  While Venkataramanan would be responsible for the businesses of L&T, Naik would focus on completing the portfolio restructuring, institutionalising the IC (Independent Company) structure, mentoring and developing the leadership team and future leaders, the group said.
  
  Naik, a towering corporate leader of the country, had joined L&T as a Junior Engineer in 1965 and rapidly rose to senior positions -- moving from General Manager to Managing Director and CEO, culminating in his appointment as Chairman in December 2003.
  
  L&T said it has undertaken an exercise, named 'Lakshya', to simplify its portfolio and has created 10 independent companies and seven subsidiaries in order to bring focus, autonomy and accountability. It had also engaged services of global strategy firms for the same.
  
  However, changes in the economic environment has led to L&T undertaking a mid-term review of strategic plan, which is now under finalisation, it said in a statement after today's board meeting.
  
  ""In line with the vision of the company to become an Indian Multinational as also looking at the current global competitive environment, it needs to develop leaders who will manage the company, going forward,"" it added.
  
  Accordingly, the board decided that there was a need for continuity and requested Naik to continue for a period of five years as Executive Chairman of the Group.
  
  ""I am honoured with the responsibility that the board has placed on me. I am also happy that A M Naik's guidance will continue to be available,"" Venkataraman said.
  
  The company said its board was confident that its decision was in the best interest of all stakeholders.

ET Now: We may have hit a fresh high on the Nifty, but somehow market internals do not inspire too much of confidence. Your view?
 
 
Mayuresh Joshi: In view of what has transpired over the past few weeks and months, and given the exuberance that we have seen in the market, our take is that the markets have done more or less enough from a short- to medium-term perspective.
 
 In the post-budget speech, the exchequer was very clear in terms of policy implementation when he said that it will take at least a quarter or more to frame policies and implement them. So, keeping this in mind, if the markets are assuming that a lot of policy action will happen over the next few months, they would be wrong because it is unlikely to happen.
 
 Secondly, the inherent risk that the markets face is the monsoons. The next two months will be critical as to how the monsoons pan out. In case there is some shortage in terms of the overall spread of rains across the country, you might have your inflationary pressures peaking out.
 
 Thirdly, a lot will depend on how the global scenario plays out. Also crucial is what the FED does over the next two to three months. These are something that world markets are watching out for.
 
 So, if one considers all these factors, one would see that the only thing that is left for the markets from short- to medium-term perspective is the corporate earnings. Corporate earnings are going to be a little bit subdued for this quarter and for two-three quarters to come. You are not going to see an exponential rise both in top line and bottom line for most companies.
 
 There would hardly be any exponential growth and even if there is, it would be very stock-specific.
 
 Markets will trade in a range. Even in terms of valuations from an FY15 perspective, we are trading at a fair valuation. So, our take is that the Nifty will find it very difficult to breach the 7900-mark. It might possibly stay in a range of 7250-7900 over the next two to three months."

ET Now: Unfortunately it is wobbly market scenario. Otherwise, we would have seen positive banking reaction maybe? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: What the SEBI has announced is positive for the banking sector. Even the conversion from debt to equity, because the apex body has tinkered with the pricing formula, is quote positive for the sector. We have seen the infamous case of Kingfisher where banks had to finally convert their debt into equity. But, the price they got was meaningless as the ruling market price was significantly lower. It was based on the earlier formula. 

 So, this will give banks tremendous leeway in getting prices which should be more realistic. 

 Now, as we have also realised that the domestic stock market especially from midcaps is very narrow, therefore, taking the six-month average price tends to be misleading at times. 

 But one thing has to be keep in mind that banks cannot hold more than 30 per cent in any company at present. Hence, that needs to be changed. Banks must be given maximum leeway to stakes in in companies and change the managements. 

 Changing managements is critical especially in times when asset quality is such a huge issue and when there are many cases in which managements really have siphoned out money. They do not really deserve to be managing the businesses. Therefore, it is critical that banks get an appropriate price when they convert their debt into equity and they are able to remove existing managements to get new persons on board. It would thus raise some hopes of preserving the asset quality of the underlying loan. 

 ET Now: You may get assets at equity valuations; you may even get it at an attractive price, but that will not change the complexion of the business. A bad asset is a bad asset; the way a bad asset could be revived is that you need to restructure the whole process and you need to really infuse some cash flows. This new formula does not take care of the revival plan. Am I right? 

 

 Hemindra Hazari: True, but that problem can be fixed only by improvement in macro-economy. I really do not, I am not at all optimistic that especially after this Budget that we are going to see any significant revival. Having said that, what is critical is that if banks hold a significant chunk of equity, they can leverage that position to remove the existing management. It is because in a lot of cases, it is the management which remain responsible the poor asset quality. 

 Either they have taken commercial decisions, which were not all viable or they have siphoned out huge amounts of cash from the projects. 

 A lot of the infrastructure projects are highly inflate the cost and banks anyway have to take a hit. Therefore, it is better that they take a hit and remove the management and replace a more stable, confident and reputable management than to have the existing management still in place. Then you are just throwing good money after bad."

 ""We are yet to conclude on the final issuance deal,"" M S Raghavan, chairman and managing director, IDBI Bank, told ET, confirming the move. The bank may do away with the issuance if it doesn’t get the right pricing. ""We have already received bids,"" the CMD added. 

 The interest rate is apparently set at 8.74%, but the bank chairman has not yet approved it. SBI Capital Market is the sole arranger of the issuance, three people familiar with the matter said. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is likely to be the largest investor in the issuance. 

 Ratings agency Crisil has assigned an AA+/Stable rating to the bond issuance. 

 The central provident fund body receives interest payment in a wide range of about Rs 5,000-8,000 crore on Special Deposit Scheme, launched by the government in July 1975, on the first day of every calendar year. 

 Earlier, in September last year, IDBI Bank mopped up Rs 1,000 crore by issuing infrastructure bonds. The coupon or interest rate was at 9.5% with similar maturity. This time, the bank would be better-off with cheaper rates as the benchmark 10-year government bond yield is now hovering 64-68 basis points lower compared to September. 

 About a month ago, country’s third-largest private sector lender, Axis Bank, collectedRs 5,705 crore by selling infrastructure bonds offering 8.85% rate. Those were rated as triple-A by CRISIL & ICRA. India’s largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank, too sold infra bonds for about Rs 3,900 crore in early September. Last year, RBI facilitated long-term lending in infrastructure and affordable or low cost housing."

  In his long and chequered career as a politician and administrator, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is unlikely to have faced a more daunting task than finalising this Budget. The competing pressures on him were intense. Fiscal deficit was way over the numbers projected in last Budget. Inflation, which had cooled in the early months of 2012, was again raising its head. Investment and consequently growth had slowed down to about 7%. Clearly, what was needed was a budget that attempted a fiscal course correction while giving an impetus to growth - itself an onerous task.

  Complicating the scenario further were the setbacks in the recent assembly elections and growing dissonance between the Congress and its allies on various policies. This meant that the political room for big bang reforms was clearly limited. Given these constraints, the finance minister has managed to perform a minor miracle. He has admirably balanced the various pulls and pressures and yet delivered a budget for growth by maintaining consumption, reviving investment, boosting capital markets and widening the tax net. 
  
  The FM is looking at capping the fiscal deficit at 5.1% for FY13. This seems realistic. His positive steps include putting FRBM implementation back on the agenda, capping the subsidy at 2% of the GDP, with the promise of reducing it to 1.7%. Also, if the government is able to deliver on the FM's promise to direct cash transfers using the UID mechanism, it would help plug leakages. All the moves on the infrastructure sector - from doubling the amount that can be raised through tax-free infrastructure bonds to 60,000 to customs duty relief for import of fuels like coal - could restart the much-needed investments in this sector. 
  
  The proposals on the capital markets side - the cut in Securities Transaction Tax, incentives under the Rajiv Gandhi equity scheme for first-time investors, and making electronic format mandatory for 10% of IPOs worth over 10 crore - are again small but directionally important steps. The raising of service tax rate to 12% was a bit of surprise, but perhaps unavoidable given the need to raise resources. But the move to a negative list will go a long way towards simplifying the process. His proposals on avoidance of tax evasion are very significant and could have long-term positive implications for the economy. 
  
  Admittedly, there were no 'big bang', headline grabbing reforms in the Budget. But the FM has done enough to rekindle growth and, more importantly, he has done it in an understated, credible manner that is unlikely to raise any political hackles and thus has a greater chance of success."

Negotiations are on between leading industry body India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), the state’s nodal agency for industrial development, for allotment of land to the trade. IBJA, consisting of 1,100 members, is proposing to shift either lock stock and barrel from the crowded Zaveri Bazaar to the city of Panvel, close to the proposed new international airport, or two nearby locations.  	The discussions began after IBJA approached chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who, in turn, asked MIDC to consider allotment of land around Panvel. “We have requested for around 500 acres to be allotted in Panvel, and will take a call based on the amount of land which can be earmarked for setting up a jewellery park, knowledge centre and accompanying facilities,” said Ketan Shroff, spokesperson, IBJA.  	Bhushan Gagrani, CEO, MIDC, told ET that Pavel may be short of land. “The association has approached us a couple of times. It’s a good idea but we don’t have 500 acres available in Panvel. Therefore, we have suggested two alternatives to them (IBJA) – Roha Mangaon where we are currently acquiring land, and Khopoli.”  	Currently, scores of jewellery manufacturers, gold refiners and bullion traders, operate out of the highly congested market at Zaveri Bazaar, where an estimated 40% of India’s gold trade takes place each year. “It’s highly inconvenient in terms of logistics, security, well-being of workers and ease of doing business. This has made it imperative for us to consider a new location,” added Shroff.  	At Khopoli, MIDC has notified the site for acquisition and setting up of an industrial zone. However, it has not started the land acquisition process as yet. Apart from these locations, the association has also suggested a separate site, also in Khopoli, to MIDC for land allotment.  	“We are currently considering all three locations. If the association is fine with Roha Mangaon site, we can allot the land in the next six months; other places may take longer. And, this will be allotted to them at compensation as per our norms,” Gagrani added.  	Zaveri Bazar is the country’s oldest jewellery market. The oldest outlet, Narandas Manordas, is over 200 years old. It also houses showrooms of reputed jewellers like TBZ The Original, Dwarkadas Chandumal, UTZ, etc.  	Until six-seven years ago Zaveri Bazaar accounted for 65% of the country’s bullion trade. But traders moved to Ahmedabad, India’s bullion capital, when the Maharashtra state government imposed stamp duty of 0.1% on gold and silver in addition to an octroi of 0.1% on gold and 2% on silver, according to Shroff. Ahmedabad imposes neither octroi nor stamp duty.  	Making Panvel a possible hub will do away with octroi and help the Mumbai Metropolitan region to reclaim the status of bullion capital."
Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear.

Do you agree?,"By Sahil Kapoor
 
 The world market was awash with a swarm of gold bugs after the financial crisis of 2008. Gold bugs are advocates of investments in Gold as a safe haven and a guard against financial Armageddon, hyperinflation, currency collapses and geopolitical troubles.
 
 A few years ago, gold bugs argued the precious metal was a can't-miss investment given the ultra-loose monetary policies around the world and the prospect of higher inflation.
 
 However, you can't find many gold bugs as the metal prices have taken a big tumble. The cumulative returns since 2010 for gold HAS almost BEEN nil compared to a return of 70 per cent by Dow Jones Industrial Average and 57 per cent by BSE S&P Sensex.
 
 The current outlook on gold is reflected in this quote by the legendary investor Warren Buffett.
 
 ""Gold is a way of going long on fear, and it has been a pretty good way of going long on fear from time to time. But, you really have to hope people become more afraid in a year or two years than they are now. And if they become more afraid, you make money, if they become less afraid, you lose money, but the gold itself doesn't produce anything.""
 
 One of the principal arguments in favour of Gold at the turn of the decade was the impending hyperinflation which would follow the massive money printing done across the world. This world economy is struggling with continued threat of deflation in Eurozone, anemic growth in Japan, the US and most of the commodity producers, causing benign inflation scenario.
 
 The steep decline in oil prices has added to this fall in inflation and has reduced inflation expectations further. Gold has historically performed fairly well in period of excessive inflation. The period of 2001 to 2008 saw gold multiply about three times, largely led by inflationary outlook and a weakening US Dollar.
 
 Post the financial crisis of 2008, Gold bugs advocated in favour of the ""catastrophe metal"" as a hedge against the then probable collapse of the US Dollar as a reserve currency. The adoption of Euro as a secondary reserve currency gained prominence and supported the gold prices further.
 
 The emergence of Chinese central bank as a buyer of gold to prop up its gold reserves created further demand for the metal amid the sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone in 2011 to 2012. As we stand today, the dynamics supporting the gold price have changed. They changed a few years ago when as a directional bet, we expected gold prices to soften to $1,000.
 
 Hyperinflation, safe-haven and a reserve currency - all these arguments seems to have taken a back seat for now. We expect these factors to continue to weigh on gold prices. A strong dollar and bearishness across commodities are what's really driving gold prices.
 
 
Gold losing safe-haven appeal:
 
 Despite all the global economic uncertainty, ""Gold's safe heaven thesis"" is not really playing out. Gold prices have remained relatively muted in response to the Greek debt crisis, which is an indication that markets have priced in the risk of sovereign default. Over the years, Gold has proved itself to be a safe-haven. However, that appeal has always been short-lived and dependent on the long-term effect of each risk-aversion episode.
 
 
Dollar Strengthening: 
 
 US Dollar has strengthened, largely led by a deep devaluating of Euro, JPY and GBP. This is a product of fresh credit easing introduced by Eurozne, Abenomics in Japan and continued easing in the UK. Many commodity-producing currencies have declined along with oil prices, giving a further fillip to US Dollar.
 
 Gold is priced in US Dollar and has an inverted correlation to it. The effect can be seen on gold prices. US Dollar Index (a measure of the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies) has appreciated 35 per cent since 2011 and in the same time period, Gold prices have declined more than 50 per cent from their peak of $1900.
 
 
Largest Gold Short Position in the COT Report's History:
 
 Speculators are holding the smallest net-bullish bet on gold since the US government data begins in 2006. Latest COT Report shows speculative gold shorts rose to just under 99,000 contracts - the largest level in the report's history. Additionally, the percentage of speculative shorts rose above 45 per cent, which is another COT report record.
 
 
Chinese appetite for gold mellowing down:
 
 The central People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced last week that bullion holdings rose to 1,658 tonnes as of the end of June, from 1,054 tonnes in April 2009. Despite the tonnage increase, Gold now accounts for 1.65 per cent of China's total foreign exchange reserves, against 1.8 per cent in June 2009. The number was much less than the perception of China holding more than 3,000 tonnes, which shows Chinese appetite for Gold is mellowing down.
 
 
ETF Selling: 
 
 ETF holdings have dropped considerably from their 2012 record high of 2,900 tonnes - roughly falling by a third. Gold ETFs worldwide today hold approximately 1,730 tonnes of gold. Sentiment toward Gold is now ""excessively negative"" and we see potential for the yellow metal to recover only once higher US interest rates are priced into markets.
 
 The breakout to the downside of the trading range suggests a fresh leg-down in prices is coming, and that this week's low of $1,085 in gold is not likely to hold. The next longer-term downside price target for gold is a major psychological support at $1,000. At domestic front, similar 8-10 per cent downside could be seen and we could see Gold prices bottoming out around Rs 23,000/10 gm in India.

"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/a-25-fall-in-crude-is-like-a-10-billion-stimulus-for-indian-economy-say-experts-top-stock-bets/articleshow/45121185.cms,m.economictimes.com,"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets","NEW DELHI: India imports around 80 per cent of its crude oil needs, and a fall in the prices of the commodity provides the much needed relief for the country's deficits as the same brings down the import bill.

Analysts say that a $25 fall in crude is like a notional $10 billion stimulus for the Indian economy.

""Falling crude oil prices led to the implementation of the alignment of diesel prices to market rates. This enabled the government to ease subsidy burden. The money saved can now be channeled to some efficient economic projects,"" says Soumyadip Raha, Research Executive - Oil & Gas at Microsec Capital Ltd.

""The government is now mulling over the idea of bringing some of the benefits of lower oil prices to the government exchequer by way of hiking duties,"" he adds.

Further, Raha says that falling crude prices result in better realisations for oil & gas firms as it increases the income of the government from taxes.

Brent crude has seen a sharp fall in 2014 so far, down nearly 30 per cent, on the back of strengthening dollar that suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities.

Brent crude has come down sharply to below $81 a barel in a matter of just five months from around $115 recorded in mid-June. This has already reduced the country's import bill significantly.

India's oil import bill for the last financial year stood at $150 billion.

India's net imports of crude amounts to about a billion barrels a year, and with every dollar decrease in oil prices the bill slips by Rs 4,000 crore, as per media reports.

""The fall in prices (of crude oil) will also lead to lowering of inflation and support higher growth. In turn, lower inflation, improvement in fiscal and current account balances will result in higher GDP growth,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.

""Yes, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the economy as it creates three-way effect on the economy. A fall in crude oil prices results in a drop in crude oil import bills, and thus the total current account deficit is reduced. This strengthens the currency also,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that a drop in crude prices will reduce government's subsidy burden as well as prices of petroleum products in the country would be lowered leading to ease in inflation.

Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors, is of the view that we are going to benefit in a big way with the fall in crude. As someone else was suggesting, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the Indian economy, he adds.

Slowing global demand, especially from the European countries and China, is one of the reasons for this massive decline in the prices of crude, say experts.

The slide in oil had a significant impact on inflation as consumer price inflation has cooled off to its lowest level ever, at 6.46 per cent in September. It has even created room for the Reserve Bank to ease interest rates sooner than expected.


	 


""The fall in oil prices has also provided a commendable stability to the rupee despite a rally in dollar index, thus attracting more inflows into the economy. Overall, the outlook for economic growth has improved,"" says Sugandha Sachdeva, AVP & Incharge - Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Securities Ltd.

As per another estimate, Sachdeva is of the view that a $10 decline in brent implies country's annual import bill falls by around $17 billion.

""Prices are expected to find a strong floor around $80 a barrel and may even retreat towards $88. Having said that, any breach of $80 per barrel would accelerate the fall and lead to a drift towards $75,"" she adds.

Top bets in the oil & Gas space:

Vivek Gupta,CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited

Investors should go long in OMCs like BPCL, HPCL, IOC we also seen have seen decent long build up (rise in open interest & rise in stock price) in these stocks. Our Top Pick is IOC, which is forming a good consolidation on weekly chart; overall trend of stock is up, investors can further enter long around 380 for the target of 440 & 460 in near term.

Nandan Chakraborty, MD-Institutional Equity Research, Axis Capital

The first thing to do when oil prices dip is to buy interest rate sensitives, and not the ones which depend on oil. It is pretty straightforward because if you look at oil marketing companies, as long as LPG and kerosene remain subsidized, they would not have too much of a slack in terms of increase in their profits.

Krishna Kumar Karwa, MD & CFO, Emkay Global Financial Services

As far as the oil marketing and refining companies are concerned, they are the prime beneficiaries of the diesel deregulation. So, we continue to be bullish on HPCL and BPCL.

From a longer-term perspective, I believe that the government is very clear about its policies as far as oil exploration is concerned. These companies should be a key beneficiary of that. They should also benefit from an increase in gas prices. So all in all, I think that these companies should give you very good returns in times to come.

Rahul Singh, Head of Research, Standard Chartered Securities

In the PSU & oil marketing companies, we are positive on Coal India as well and somewhere down the line even ONGC should benefit from lowering of subsidies may be in FY16, although clarity on that is still to emerge. So while PSUs as an asset class have run up and some of them have doubled-tripled, there is still some juice left in some of these companies. But you cannot just generalize.

Bottom-up stock-picking will become more and more important even within the PSUs. So you will have to differentiate much more between the oil marketing companies versus upstream versus GAIL and so on.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: What is your current market view?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Markets will remain range bound in the short-term. They are waiting for an earnings trigger because we saw a significant downgrade in the last quarter. As we get into this first quarter, the trend does not seem to change because the exit rate in the last quarter was very weak, especially on the top line growth but we are pretty confident that you should see a recovery in growth in the second half.
 
 We have seen some early signs of government spending picking up in the first month of this fiscal year. That is going to be the key driver. Government spending this year is going to be key in terms of kick starting demand and we see an impact of that probably in the second half coming through. After the correction, we have seen valuations turning out to be reasonable and any further correction because of global developments could be a good time to increase and add investments into equities.
 
 
ET Now: Yesterday, we saw Tech Mahindra come out and say that the next quarter is not going to be as great. Now, this is something that we have seen played out even in the last quarter when it was almost a blanket profit warning signal from most IT majors. This time too do you sense that this could be more of a sectoral trend rather than just a company specific one? Would the IT sector better avoided for now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: There were cross currency movements in the last quarter, which impacted the dollar growth for most companies. That impact will not be so severe in this quarter because we see some mean reversion over there but in case of the specific company, which you mentioned, I do not think it is an issue across the sector. It is probably the telecom space, where it has a larger footprint, which will result in some slowdown. However, on a broader scale, things are not that bad. In terms of guidance, Cognizant has shown an improvement.
 
 
ET Now: So stick to large cap IT because Infosys, TCS, are sounding reasonably confident for FY16, but what about smaller companies such as KPIT or MindTree?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The IT industry is going through a transition phase where compared to earlier times and material contracts, they are getting more into digitalisation and companies able to do that transition into the digital world are the companies, which will be able to get such an increment because that is where this trend is headed and that is where the incremental orders are.
 
 
ET Now: If indeed the government is going to spend in the first two quarters of the current half of the current fiscal, would the markets start discounting?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The government spending essentially would be in areas like infrastructure which will be in say roads, railways and agriculture etc. These are the areas where you will see not only the central government but the state government because there is a lot of allocation to the state governments this year in the budget and how the state spend also would be important.
 
 So, as we see order flows coming in especially in the road sector, that would lead to some indication. At least it might not reflect into traction down the line because this month is a monsoon month. Activities levels will be a bit low but slowly that money would start to trickle down, get in the hands of various people, consumers. Urban consumption Will start to pick up slowly.
 
 
ET Now: So when you say consumption, considering it is such a large umbrella, what are people going to consume more? More pizzas? Are they going to buy more shoes, more branded clothes or is it going to be cars and other such things?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Currently, what we are seeing is a transition. That is why overall growth is not looking that great. As that inflexion point happens and we are seeing some early signs of that, obviously the demand would be more on the discretionary side. Consumer staples is where the growth is still going to be bit sedate but as your job creation happens, as disposable income increases, as interest rates go down a bit, we do not expect much but at least another 50 bps. We should see demand for all these consumer discretionary products to pick up.
 
 
ET Now: Why do you think demand will pick up, why are you bullish on urban consumption?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: It is not just interest rates which are going to make a big difference. Obviously, interest rates coming down will mean that your EMIs on mortgages will come down. That will mean some amount of savings, which you can spend but more importantly it is going to be demand in terms of job creation. Secondly, because of lower inflation, your real wages are much stronger than what it was earlier so that will slowly lead to pick-up in consumption. We are not expecting any big pick-up but at the margin these are the trends, which we are observing.
 
 
ET Now: Do you sense a renewed vigour in Indian pharma, which is largely exposed to the United States? I am looking at your holding and you do not have too many pharma names. Have I got the holdings right or you genuinely do not have pharma name?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: No, we are neutral on pharma. We have got some of the leading top large cap pharma companies in this portfolio. The pharma companies have had a very good run. Lately, we have seen some kind of product approval delays in a few companies and some correction. The valuations of Indian pharma story continues to look great. They appear good from medium to long term perspective.
 
 The valuations in some of the companies had really gone up very high and there were some near term concerns in a few names. However, the broader long term trajectory in terms of growth in the Indian companies in the US generic space and lot of the companies are also now clearly getting into complex generics, which is slightly higher. So, we think that the growth in this sector should be around 15 per cent to 20 per cent, which is pretty good so we are not negative, we are neutral on that sector.
 
 
ET Now: So you expect the market to be range bound for the next few odd months, what could snap out of this range and what is the biggest risk for India right now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Clearly, monsoon was something, which we were looking at. It has come in pretty good at least for the month of June. One has to see how the onset is in the next few months or so. On the reform side, we have the next monsoon session beginning and expect some development regarding GST. We do not expect much to happen on the Land Acquisition Bill but GST is something, which we would like to get implemented in the next fiscal year because you require these kind of triggers for the market especially at this point in time when growth is still illusive. So these are some of the factors, which one would look at."

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: Our most awaited reform which could have an impact on Indian economy is GST. Assuming that GST would be in place in next 12-15 months, markets would start buying into those sectors well ahead of time. With this assumption, which are the stocks one should buy?
 
 
Deven Choksey: In general, we believe that the GST roadmap will be spelled out in this particular budget. Whether it would get across the board implemented in all the states at one go remains to be seen. However, even if it is getting implemented, it is a process that wille take about one and a half to two years to fully materialise as far as the books of the companies are concerned from the point of view of bringing down the cost structure. The tax structure which will come down because of the rationalisation through GST should benefit most of the consumption oriented businesses before anybody else. Hence, to a greater extent, the focus should remain under the consumption space. Given the kind of possibility in the economy of growth coming back above 6 per cent in the next 12 to 15 months, we believe that automobile sector would probably lead the show at this point of time. Also, automobile sector could possibly have major benefits because of a likely possibility of the bank rate coming down and if interest rates starts coming down, then it would be a double benefit to many of the auto companies. Typically the commercial vehicle segment which have still not moved up as much as the other vehicles or passenger vehicles like Maruti and other companies, I would think that Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland kind of companies within the auto space should remain in the favourable list given this possibility along with the likes of Bajaj Auto which would also remain quite comfortably placed as far as the growth is concerned. This is also due to the export oriented perspective they have. Hence, within the auto space, we like these three. We believe that the consumption space would largely get favoured with the roll out of GST going forward."
Harsh Mariwala in no hurry to pass on the baton of Marico to his children Rishabh & Rajvi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/harsh-mariwala-in-no-hurry-to-pass-on-the-baton-of-marico-to-his-children-rishabh-rajvi/articleshow/32684847.cms,m.economictimes.com,Harsh Mariwala in no hurry to pass on the baton of Marico to his children Rishabh & Rajvi,"MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: Harsh Mariwala isn’t ready to pass on the baton of Marico, a Rs13,500-crore (market cap) consumer goods firm, to the next generation. Not that he isn’t keen, but he would rather wait for a few more years.
 
 Mariwala, who stepped down as Marico managing director on Tuesday, said it’s too early to say if his children Rishabh and Rajvi will eventually be at the helm of the company that he started some 40 years ago. “It’s still too early to come to any conclusion and we will wait and watch as to what pans out. You cannot predict everything in life,” he told ET.
 
 As ET reported in its Tuesday edition, Mariwala passed on the day-to-day operations of the company to CEO Saugata Gupta who has been elevated as MD. His son Rishabh, 33, had spent three years developing business at Marico’s beauty salon services arm Kaya Skin Clinic before starting a premium handmade soaps company in 2009. Almost around the same time, Mariwala’s daughter Rajvi, 34, too opted out of Marico — she was a part of its brand-building team — to focus on sociological research.
 
 
 
  Mariwala, 63, said the firm does not intend to deviate from its strategy of a having a professional management to run its operations and expand the breadth of its products and services. He said the move to promote Gupta was a natural process and not a sudden decision. “Saugata will be in complete control, in charge of managing the overall business,” Mariwala said, adding that all key division heads will now report to Gupta.
 
 Over 43 years ago, Mariwala quit the crowded traders lane on Masjid Bunder in Mumbai with an ambition to make his two highly commoditised products — edible and coconut oil — national brands. Today, Parachute and Saffola are among the biggest oil brands in India, and Marico has about 20 brands across 25 markets. That is what Gupta, 45, has got to manage and grow.
 
 Mariwala’s mandate to Gupta is clear — drive top line growth in existing and new value-added products and capitalise the combined international and domestic business to become far more profitable. But the market environment isn’t very favourable. Copra prices are at all-time high, with 76 per cent increase since last year.
 
 Also, Marico has been underperforming the market by posting less than 5 per cent volume growth for Parachute and single-digit growth for Saffola since the last few quarters. The company admits that short-term pressures will always be there and the key challenge in the long term is to move beyond oil and succeed in value-added portfolio. Gupta said the firm is trying to shift portfolios in favour of new categories such as oats, personal care and hair colour that contribute 20 per cent of its total sales.
 
 At the same time, there will be crosspollination between its international and domestic brands that will perhaps help the firm enter adjacent categories. According to analysts, while Marico maintains its market shares, sharp price increases in hair oils could keep volume growth under pressure in the future. “The company seems cognizant of poor returns in its past acquisitions and sub optimal return ratios and is looking at sustaining 30 per cent plus dividend payout,” Amnish Aggarwal, analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, wrote in an investor note."

"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shreejit-mishra-two-others-quit-hul-stock-up/articleshow/8659741.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL; stock up","MUMBAI: Four senior-level executives at Hindustan Unilever have quit over the past few months after spending almost two decades with the country's largest consumer goods company. Among those who have put in their papers are Shreejit Mishra, executive director (Foods), N Rajaram, VP (Haircare & Lakme), Srikanth Srinivasamadhavan, general manager (Media Services) for South Asia, and Jayakumar Krishnaswamy, general manager for Supply Chain Excellence. Mishra was not available for comment, while Srinivasamadhavan declined to speak to ET. HUL neither denied nor confirmed the senior-level departures. 
  
  At 9:55 am, shares of Hindustan Unilever were trading 0.40 per cent up at Rs 304 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  Rajaram joined Bharti Airtel in March as its chief marketing officer, while Krishnaswamy joined Akzo Nobel as Director SCM, late last year after spending over 15 years at HUL in two separate stints.Replying to a detailed questionnaire sent by ET, an HUL spokesperson said, ""The attrition rate in HUL is significantly below industry level, at 5% per annum for the last four years. What we have is natural attrition, which is essential and healthy for all organisations in terms of both talent management and development."" Top officials in the know about these developments said a changing work culture at HUL and increasing job opportunities for HUL managers outside have triggered the exits. 
  
  ""Many of these managers have been in the same role and designation for over three years now. HUL is on top of Polman's list, and his directive that managers will have to spend longer tenures in their existing roles to ensure consistent business strategy, may have also triggered the move. The internal target of around 20% sales growth every quarter is adding to the pressure on HUL managers,"" said another senior HUL official. When Paul Polman took over as Unilever CEO in January 2009, the company was under pressure as customer spend on branded products had slowed down. Polman, the first outsider to head Unilever, injected some aggression into the group - including at its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever - and put in place a performance culture across companies globally, linking rewards to results. 
  
  Brand managers were also asked to report on 30-day schedules, adding to the pressure to perform consistently every quarter. 
  
  The results are now visible at HUL, which has been witnessing 13% volume growth for the fiscal ending March - the highest in over a decade, despite a large base of nearly Rs20,000 crore in sales 
  
  Mishra, who is HUL CEO Nitin Paranjpe's batchmate, is the most high-profile exit. He joined HUL in 1987 as a management trainee and moved up the ladder to become a member of the core management committee. Four years ago Mishra, then VP Activation-Asia AMET, Unilever and based in Singapore, was made Executive Director (Foods). During his tenure, the processed foods division has grown 67%, from Rs 538 crore in 2007 to Rs 900 crore today. 
  
  Watchers say HUL's managers are much sought after in the corporate world. ""It's good to see HUL managers becoming ambitious. The company has always been a good training ground for managers to perform well in other companies across sectors,"" said Kannan Sitaram, operating partner at India Equity Partners, who spent over two decades with Unilever. ""In the last few years, HUL's pyramid was getting narrower at the top, influencing some managers to take up top jobs at other companies""."

 The Pune-based pharma company had filed draft offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the proposed IPO in June last year. 

 The proposed issue comprised of fresh issue of up to Rs 300 crore and an offer for sale of up to 25,13,057 equity share. 

 However, the company through its lead merchant banker IDFC Capital withdrew its offer documents on June 6 this year, as per the latest update available with Sebi. 

 The pharma company intends to utilise the net proceeds for setting up of new manufacturing facilities and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, research and development and general corporate purposes. 

 The company is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a broad range of pharmaceutical products globally. 

 Emcure Pharmaceuticals operates nine manufacturing facilities, eight of which are located in India and one in the US.

Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-it-will-be-a-tough-task-for-vishal-sikka-to-revive-infosys-back-to-its-glory/articleshow/36430060.cms,m.economictimes.com,Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,"The mood on bourses appears to be not so encouraging after the announcement of Infosys to appoint Vishal Sikka as CEO and MD. After a firm opening on Thursday, the stock came under selling pressure. It had lost 2% on NSE by 11am. The big worry for investors is whether it’s too late for Sikka to be at the helm and whether the current issues facing the erstwhile industry bellwether can be surmountable.
 
 Sikka has to wade through following major challenges and that would be easier said than done:
 
 1. 
The growth conundrum- Infosys has added a significant number of new clients, 238 to be precise at the gross level, in the four quarters to March 2014. This is higher compared to its peers. However, this did not culminate into higher revenue growth. Infy’s sequential revenue growth lagged that of its close peers including TCS and Cognizant and a smaller peer, HCL Technologies.
 
 2. 
The changing nature of deliverables- The global IT outsourcing industry has shifted from traditional wage arbitrage to multi-year, deals that are capable of transforming the business. This includes remote infrastructure management (RIM) services. At present, Infosys derives over 7% revenue from RIM compared with peers who earn 12-34% revenue from this segment. RIM has shown a higher growth over the past few years compared with the traditional services. This makes it necessary for Sikka to focus on improving Infy’s exposure to this segment.
 
 3. 
Higher employee attrition rate- Infosys has not been able to tame the rate of attrition in the past few quarters. Attrition was 18.7% during the March 2014 quarter compared with 16.3% a year ago. This is also higher than 11.3% for TCS and 16.9% for HCL Tech. Talent management and retention will be a tough task for Sikka.
 
 4. 
Sliding profitability- Infosys has long been following what it coined as quality growth in the form of industry-best margin profile. But this has changed over the past few quarters as the company reported a sharp fall in operating margin.

Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/association-of-mutual-funds-in-india-warns-members-to-stay-away-from-suspicious-ready-forward-certificate-of-deposits/articleshow/32817251.cms,m.economictimes.com,Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,"The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has asked its members to desist from suspicious ready forward deals in certificate of deposits (CDs). In an e-mail to fund houses a few days ago, AMFI chief executive HN Sinor also warned that the market regulator wants to end this practice as it leads to asset management companies risking investor money. 

 “Also, desist from entering into undesirable trades/transactions, which are not in conformity with regulation,” Sinor said in the e-mail, reviewed by ET. Sinor asked the fund houses to furnish daily transaction date to CRISIL/ICRA, the rating companies that provide daily CD quotes. ET had on March 12 reported that some asset management companies were doing CD trades at a pre-fixed rate, which were perceived to be violating norms while increasing the risk for investors. The financial mechanism, known as “parking” or “river crossing” or “holding period return”, is generally seen towards the end of a financial year and involves four parties — the issuer of CDs, the ultimate subscribers, cashrich entities such as banks and companies that provide parking space, and the intermediaries. 

 The latest AMFI communiqué came after the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) sought clarification on such practices in an e-mail dated March 21. “Some fund houses complained to Sebi to stop recurrence of this unhealthy practice. The regulator spoke to AMFI on this and later, official e-mails were exchanged,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. 

 In its reply to Sebi, AMFI assured of maintaining “best practices” among fund houses. It wrote, “The parking phenomenon……. leads to funds buying assets at yields higher than the then prevailing yields in April.” 

 Mutual funds, the biggest buyers of CDs, face redemption pressure in their liquid funds from lenders that need money to expand credit. At this point, some intermediaries or brokers connect some cash-rich entities, be it banks or corporates, which extend funding support to MFs by temporarily buying the three-month CDs at typically 9.60% to 9.90% range at the fag end of March quarter from issuers."
Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/infibeam-mulls-filing-draft-red-herring-prospectus-by-december-as-it-gears-up-for-its-ipo-next-year/articleshow/44953953.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year,"NEW DELHI: Ahmedabad-based e-commerce company Infibeam plans to file its draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by December as it seeks to make its market debut next fiscal amid increased inflows into the country's consumer internet businesses.
 
 Infibeam, which owns and operates e-commerce venture Infibeam.com and B2B e-commerce platform BuildABazaar, is looking to raise about Rs 500 crore -Rs 1,000 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), while targeting a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore-Rs 4,000 crore.
 
 “Investor interest continues to peak when it comes to strong internet businesses in India that have shown consistent growth, and I think we are well poised to capture that,“ said Vishal Mehta, founder and chief executive of Infibeam.
 
 Infibeam, which sees about 80,000 transactions across its platforms, has targeted a revenue of Rs 500 crore and gross merchandise sales of about Rs 2,000 crore for the current fiscal.
 
 The IPO, expected in 2015, will make Infibeam the first Indian e-commerce company to go public in the country. HomeShop18, which has al so announced plans to go public, has filed documents to list on the US exchanges.
 
 Infibeam, which has appointed Axis Bank to be the lead book runner for the IPO, is looking to list on both the National Stock exchange and the BSE.
 
 The developments come at a time when consumer internet companies, while receiving increasing funding from private equity and strategic investors, have also begun to receive significant attention from the country's retail investors.
 
 “There will be an appetite and there is no reason why we won't see the same trends as in the US or China,“ said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital, a leading investment bank.
 
 Local business listings website JustDial's public market flotation in May last year saw a strong response from investors, with the company raising about Rs 950 crore in the process. The company's market capitalisation on Monday stood at Rs 10,200 crore.
 
 Matrimonial venture BharatMatrimony.com has also signalled its intention of going public by the next financial year, which could see other consumer internet companies follow suit.
 
 Infibeam, which is yet to raise any foreign institutional capital, may also look to sell a portion of its equity through private placements ahead of its planned IPO. Mehta, however, did not disclose details, stating that the company was still in discussions.
 
 Foreign investors have purchased a net $34.99 billion of stocks and debt until October 21 this year. In 2013, India's stock market received a net foreign fund inflow of $20.10 billion while the debt market saw an outflow of $7.97 billion, stock exchange data showed.
 
 “The Indian market is looking at the consumer internet space, but while it may accept the business model, it may not accept companies that continue to make losses. That is the gap which has to be addressed,“ said Garg."

Niftys still holding the momentum: Nirmal Bang,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/niftys-still-holding-the-momentum-nirmal-bang/articleshow/6806263.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Nifty’s still holding the momentum: Nirmal Bang,"The Nifty started the earlier week on a bearish note, as fair amount of liquidity was pulled out of the system for the Coal India IPO. The Nifty ended the week at 6066; almost flat compared to the previous week’s close. 
  
  FIIs bought Rs 1,893 crore worth of shares in cash while local institutions sold worth Rs 1,388 crore India VIX, which measures the immediate expected volatility, and saw a weekly high of 23.9 and closed at 21.61. 
  
  We saw highest build-up of Calls at 6200 followed by 6300 (for the October and November series). We expect this activity to continue as the market gathers a bullish undertone. Highest Put build-up was seen at 6000 strike. PCR-OI for the October expiry is at 1.18, while that for the November expiry stood at 1.24. Higher PCR for November is purely a function of hedging activity; with majority of Put build-up seen at strikes below 5900. It should not be construed as a bearish signal.
  
  Overseas growth data to be watched for will be US home sales, employment data and advance estimates for US 3Q-GDP. Back home, we will have WPI data being reported on the expiry day. Technically, the Nifty has not given any signs of topping out and is still holding the momentum. Fresh round of selling could be seen only if the Nifty hits a new bottom of 5930 and trades below this level. 
  
  Till then, we continue to maintain ‘buy’ on every decline. Fresh round of buying could be seen, if the Nifty holds above 6115, then the next target could be 6220-6330. The market will continue to consolidate in the range of (5900-6200) with extreme volatility on the cards, as metal majors JSPL, Sterlite and SAIL report 
  earning this week. 
  
  Strong support is seen at 6010 levels. We observed very high Call IVs at ATM strikes for Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Hindalco and ICICI Bank hinting these scrips may see a run-up from their current levels.

Ajay Bagga: We have pretty much global size players emerging in broader pharma story. I would say that top four-five pharma counters would give multiple year returns. Hospitals are very capital intensive. We have some well run companies in this pocket but it is too small a sector to really focus on and so very difficult to give a call.

Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/euro/usd-looking-at-support-between-1-3815-30/articleshow/34377220.cms,m.economictimes.com,Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30,"Euro Summary  	Euro-dollar closed in NY Monday at $1.3853 after rate had corrected away from highs of $1.3879 to $1.3840 into the European close before it drifted higher through the US afternoon. Rate touched an early low of $1.3849 in Asia before picking up fresh demand that lifted it to $1.3865 ahead of the European open. This recovery/buoyant tone continued into Europe as rate pushed on to $1.3872, holding back at $1.3865 into the release of Saxony CPI data. The m/m release showing a fall of 0.1% prompted sales to $1.3860 but with the y/y coming in at 1.3% (up from previous 0.9%) saw buyers quickly emerge into the dip to take it up to retest Monday's high at $1.3879. Rate eased away from this level, with the correction given an added shove from release of soft Italian retail sales, ECB M3 data and soft German states' CPI. Rate found support at $1.3855 (61.8% $1.3840-79) before bouncing back to $1.3870 as Germany NRW CPI came in above expectations. The euro was holding firm in late morning trade, with continued talk of Russian interest to buy euros in dips. Resistance seen at $1.3879/85, ahead of $1.3900. Support $1.3850/40.  	EUR/USD  	Still failing to break significantly through the 76.4% Fibo retracement at $1.3876, maybe been a couple of points higher, at this stage. Now looking to support from between $1.3815-30 to hold this decline, or risk a much deeper fall and the possibilty of a double top around $1.3878. While intact, we can see another attempt higher, $1.3904-$1.3977 the immediate target zone above. Below $1.3815 and the Apr 22 low at $1.3786 becomes key.  	Sterling Summary  	Cable closed in NY Monday at $1.6810 after rate had posted multi year highs at $1.6858 on the back of demand prompted by confirmation from US Pfizer of its interest to buy UK AstraZeneka. However, talk of an Astra price tag rebuttal, along with Pfizer stating that funds for such a takeover are mainly held offshore, weighed back on sterling, which along with release of stronger than forecast US house data pressed cable to session lows of $1.6801. Demand between $1.6805/1.6795 cushioned the move. Early Asian trade was contained within a tight $1.6807/10 range (trade very subdued due to the Tokyo holiday; start of Golden Week) before it lifted to $1.6817, settling between $1.6813/15 into Europe. Reported euro-sterling stops above stg0.8250 targeted in opening Europe trade, the rate pushing to stg0.8252 before reversing to stg0.82255 as sterling picked up decent demand on positioning ahead of UK GDP release. Positive press comments by BOE Carney provided an added boost as cable traded to $1.6846. However, data came in just under forecast and sterling was sold to $1.6792/stg0.8259 but buyers quickly emerged to take cable back to $1.6820, the cross to stg0.8245.  	GBP/USD  	Rally through $1.6841 has been curtailed by the swing target at $1.6857 so far. Subsequent decline has to hold above $1.6790-95 support, in order to retain current upside momentum. Loss would put recent $1.6779-$1.6765 lows under pressure, beneath which $1.6713-$1.6662 come back into the picture. While near term supports hold, then we can challenge $1.6857 again, with $1.6881-$1.6918 still the target zone above.  	Yen Summary  	Dollar-yen witnessed a very subdued Asian session with trade tied to a narrow Y102.47-54 range. The cross opening around Y141.97 made a show through Y142.00 on the back of triggered stops in euro-aussie, before stalling ahead of tech resistance at Y142.16 (61.8% of Y143.45-140.08). Traders await the BOJ policy meeting and press conference tomorrow for further market direction. Demand via the crosses improved appetite in early Europe, lifting the pairs to Y102.55/Y142.25 and a break of tight overnight ranges. Euro-yen triggered stops on the move before momentum stalled and drifted lower. Release of German Saxony CPI which came in lower at -0.1% m/m initially slipped to Y142.12, before a stronger y/y reading countered the move, spiking to Y142.27. Second wave demand with added support from a strong sterling-yen move took the cross on to extended highs of Y142.45. Mixed CPI readings from Brandenburg, Hesse and Bavaria followed and with added weight from soft eurozone M3 data, pared light gains. A stronger North Rhine CPI looked to re-test intraday highs, however the move lacked conviction to settle in narrow range trade. Dollar-yen tracked early moves and spiked to Y102.67, the rate holds firm with offers seen into Y102.70.  	USD/YEN  	The move through Y102.40 on Monday should now give us another look at Y102.72. Above and we head for Y103.15-Y103.45, an area which includes two projected targets, as well as Fibo retracements. May well be tough to break above here at this stage. Support in the meantime has moved up to Y102.20-30 and a loss here on the day would be a disappointment and suggest the recovery was struggling again. This would bring Y101.88-98 back as key support below."

 The five companies which got listed on BSE SME today are -- Gala Print City, M D Inducto Cast, Loyal Equipments, Jiya Eco Products and Majestic Research Services & Solutions. 

 With this, as many as 104 companies have been listed on BSE SME since the launch of the platform in March 12, 2012. Of these, six companies have migrated to the exchange's main board. 

 As on date, BSE SME platform has helped the listed SMEs raise nearly Rs 756 crore from the capital markets. 

 The BSE SME platform helps SMEs raise funds to meet their business needs. 

 Of the five companies -- Gala Print City, M D Inducto Cast, Loyal Equipments and Jiya Eco Products -- are based in Gujarat, while Majestic Research Services & Solutions is located in Karnataka. 

 Noting that there were thousands of potentially good SMEs that should list on capital markets, BSE Managing Director and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan told reporters that 20-25 companies are expected to list on SME platform in the next 2-3 months. 

 ""In this fiscal, 100 more SMEs are expected to hit the markets,"" he added.

S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sp-upgrade-may-drive-fii-debt-flow/articleshow/43764215.cms,m.economictimes.com,S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,"MUMBAI: The foreign fund flows into Indian debt instruments may turn into a tide with investors gaining confidence after Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook for India to stable from negative in line with other international rating companies Moody’s and Fitch. 

 Standard & Poor’s move last week, owing to the new stable government at the Centre that the company will prove conducive to reforms, came at a time when foreign holding limits in government bonds are nearly exhausted and overseas investors are turning to corporate debt, bringing borrowing costs of companies lower even as the Reserve Bank of India wants to keep rates high. 

 “The change in S&P’s outlook will only strengthen global investors’ favourable long-term outlook towards India,” said Neville Fernandes, head of debt capital markets at Citi India. “The confluence of low interest rates, tight credit spreads, abundant liquidity and favourable investor outlook for India presents a very attractive financing opportunity for Indian corporates.” 

 India’s rating of BBB-minus is the lowest in investment grade, below which is the ‘junk’ category where investors are normally wary of investing. 

 Till August this year, foreign institutional investors or FIIs have net invested Rs 1,02,473 crore in Indian debt securities compared with net sales of Rs 50,848 crore in 2013. 

 FIIs are fast exhausting their limits or caps set for investing in Indian debt securities. They have already utilised nearly 97% of the $25 billion earmarked for government securities while they have exhausted 66.50% of the limit for long-term investments in government bonds for more than five years. 

 Overseas investors have of late turned to corporate debt segment capped at $51 billion. So far, they have exhausted about 46% compared with 35% on June 2. 

 Since government limits for regular FIIs and foreign portfolio investors or FPIs are practically filled, enquiries are increasingly coming in for corporate debt investments, said Ananth Narayan, regional head of financial markets at South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. 

 According to dealers, some of the actively traded corporate securities include top-rated Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, Food Corporation of India, HDFC Ltd, L&T and UltraTech. 

 The yield spread between government and corporate bonds has contracted 15-20 basis points in the past few months, suggesting fall in corporate bond yields. Yield and prices move in opposite direction. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. 

 “In September alone, so far we have seen high inflows of about $1.5 billion, which could be a record high. In terms of pricing, corporate issuers would be benefited due to higher demand,” said Lakshmi Iyer, senior vice president and head of fixed income and products at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management. 

 Acting as custodians, two multinational banks have in the past few weeks added 15-20 institutional clients each from Europe for investing in India. Large institutional investors like Pimpco, BlackRock, Warburg Pincus, Fidelity and Fairfax are expected to step up their bets in Indian debt securities, dealers said. Last month, foreign fund Franklin Templeton had bought bonds worth about Rs 16,000 crore in the largest single-day purchase of Indian government securities. 

 “The ratings revision encapsulates the positive sentiment on India, but more importantly takes us a step closer to a game-changing rating upgrade for India. We believe large institutional investors will continue to invest,” said Amit Bordia, head of corporate Finance at Deutsche Bank India. 

 Some foreign central banks and long-term pension and insurance funds from Southeast Asian and European countries are also expected to ramp up their investments with lot sizes of Rs 200-500 crore each."

Deven Choksey: Yes, at times, it would surprise us for sure. Not every company would probably fit into the M&A kind of a story that we are talking about. Even I am sure that Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy probably must have done a good amount of due diligence before buying into the Ranbaxy. So to a greater extent, applying the same yardstick to every company would be wrong but yes, the market has a mind of its own. Probably they have some different way of looking at Wockhardt. I am not totally sure as to what are the kind of stories that they are playing around with. But yes, where exactly the growth comes from in this company is an intriguing question.
 
 So we would not get into this particular company. We would rather stay with the likes of Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy, the likes of Cipla, the likes of Glenmark, or Lupin in the pharma space."

Similarly with Welspun Corps there must be some news but these moves need to be sustained and it needs to move up much higher at least 15% to 20% higher, so from here you need to cross those 90-95 type of zones before you can say that this has bottomed out.

 The company's net profit gained 67% year-on-year to Rs 20.6 crore, while net sales rose 37% to Rs 329 crore. Analysts said the results were above estimates. 

 ""V-Guard results have been much better than estimates and with increased focus on improving working capital; we believe the growth to be qualitative too,"" said IDBI Capital analysts in a note to clients.

US stock futures edge higher before jobs data,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/futures-edge-higher-as-tech-stocks-rebound-private-jobs-data-on-tap/articleshow/93907513.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Futures edge higher as tech stocks rebound, private jobs data on tap","US stock index futures edged higher on Wednesday as technology and growth stocks snapped back, while investors waited for private payrolls data to gauge how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to tame decades-high inflation.

 The three main indexes are set for sharp monthly declines, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 4% after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's blunt and hawkish remarks on Friday about keeping monetary policy tight ""for some time"" quashed hopes of more modest rate hikes.

 Meanwhile, mixed economic data signaling easing price pressures and strong labor market has weighed on investors' mind heading into September, which is a typically a weak month for stock market returns.

 The benchmark S&P 500 is up 9.6% from its mid-June lows but remains in bear market after plummeting earlier this year.

 ADP National Employment report, due at 08:15 am ET, is expected to show private payrolls likely increased by 288,000 in August. It will be followed by a reading on Chicago PMI for August after market open.

 On Tuesday, data showed U.S. job openings rose to 11.239 million in July, pushing stocks to close lower for a third straight session.

 It also comes ahead of the more comprehensive and closely watched jobs data for August on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 300,000 jobs last month after rising by 528,000 in July.

 Any signs of a cooling job market would be welcomed by markets as that could ease the pressure on the Fed to stick to outsized rate hikes.

 Heavyweight technology and growth stocks such as Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc and Nvidia Corp, which took a beating in last few days due to a surge in Treasury yields on rate hike prospects, rose between 0.6% and 0.8% in premarket trading.

 At 07:07 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 25 points, or 0.08%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.26%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 83.75 points, or 0.68%.

United Spirits could have the best risk-reward ratio,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/united-spirits-could-have-the-best-risk-reward-ratio/articleshow/34068378.cms,m.economictimes.com,United Spirits could have the best risk-reward ratio,"The timing of Diageo’s open offer at Rs3,030 per share of United Spirits, just a little before the Whyte & Mackay (W&M) sale and prior to the national elections, is interesting, given the low premium on offer and the fact it would allow certainty of control to Diageo. Investors should consider accumulating the stock at the current level, given some of the triggers for the company, going ahead.
 
 The positives that could play out in the next few quarters include cash from Whyte and Mackay sale, new CEO and the premium story. USL could have the best risk-reward ratio for the next few months. The upside can be significant, and the downside limited, irrespective of the election outcome (due to the open offer which will begin in June), analysts say. “Diageo is our top pick due to several catalysts in the stock,” said Manoj Menon, consumer analyst, Deustche Equities.
 
 
  
Whyte & Mackay Impact 
 
 The company is expected to complete the W&M asset sale in the next few months after concerns on competition raised by the UK Office of Fair Trade. The company has hired Standard Chartered, Rothschild and Rabo Bank as advisors and it’s understood that the bids have already come in. Although the bid prices are not known, analysts value W&M at £350-700 million (Rs3,500-7,000 crore).
 
 “If the value realised for W&M is around £700 million, this will unlock value for United Spirits, wipe out its entire debt and increase its long-term return ratio profile,” said Arnab Mitra of Credit Suisse in a recent report. He added that W&M value unlocking could be a major trigger for the USL stock and at a valuation of £650 million, the EPS upside could be almost 45.2 per cent for FY15. At the end of September 2013, its net debt stood at Rs7,100 crore with over two-thirds of the company’s operating profit going towards debt servicing.
 
 
Lowest Open Offer Premium
 
 The offer is about 18.5 per cent higher than the floor price (26-week average price) of USL, one of the lowest among open offers in two years. This is despite Diageo seeking control of United Spirits. Last year, HUL had launched open offer at 23 per cent premium and GSK Consumer Healthcare at 37.2 per cent to the floor price. Both the stocks are now trading above their offer prices.
 
 “We are advising clients to buy the stock as, among large-caps, it has the best risk-reward ratio,” said a sales official of a leading multinational brokerage on condition of anonymity. “There is a possibility that Diageo has kept a buffer and may increase the open offer price after talking to institutional investors, who may not tender at such a low premium.”
 
 
Diageo on USL
 
 In November 2012, when Diageo acquired USL at Rs1,440, the investment was expected to be economic profit positive in six years. Despite more than doubling the price (Rs3,030 now), Diageo claims the investment would be economic profit positive in seven years. “There has been a significant rerating of the Indian consumer goods story, given the promise of renewed economic buoyancy and other macro positives,” said Deirdre Mahlan, CFO, Diageo, in a recent interview.
 
 This reflects an upward revision in earnings estimates by Diageo for USL. “We do not expect a full acceptance for the offer and believe longer term investors will wait for the premiumisation theme to play out in USL,” said Harit Kapoor of IDFC."
United Bank raises $350 million under MTN programme,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/united-bank-raises-350-million-under-mtn-programme/articleshow/34091523.cms,m.economictimes.com,United Bank raises $350 million under MTN programme,"MUMBAI: State-owned Union Bank of India (UBI) has raised $350 million by selling offshore bonds as part of its $2 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme. They will be listed in the Singapore Exchange. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 

 These bonds of five-and-a-half year maturities come with a coupon rate of about 4.50%. The bank has arrived at such pricing after adding a 280-basis point spread over and above the 5-year US Treasury, which is currently trading in the range of 1.70-1.74%. The effective yield has come around 4.54%. ""The entire fund will be used for offshore operations,"" a senior bank official told ET, adding that rates offered were a win-win for both the investors and the bank. Institutional investors across Asia, Europe and the Middle-East have subscribed to the issuance. 

 UBI has sold bonds through their Hong Kong branch. These offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase were the investment bankers for the issue building. The securities are rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors while S&P, another global rating company, has assigned a BBB- to the issuance. 

 Almost two weeks ago, the State Bank of India (SBI) had raised a total of $1.25 billion by selling bonds in two maturities: five and ten years. The five-year bond was priced at a spread or gap of 205 bps over the 5-year US treasury, which would be equivalent to a yield of 3.62%. This is significantly below than the Union Bank of India's spread at 280 bps. ""Being the largest Indian lender SBI commands premium among investors, who always consider the bank as quasi-government bond. The rest state-owned banks do not enjoy the same,"" said an investment banker."

ET Now: Is there story in tyre coming to an end because these stocks have done phenomenally well and while they are up today, JK Tyre is up 6%, Ceat up 3 odd per cent, but they have seen a stunning move till now, I mean for how much longer can this continue? 

 Sudip Bandyopadhyay: Well, it is going to continue much longer, in fact our view is that rubber prices are not going to start going up in calendar year 2015 also, probably calendar year 2016 will see rubber prices going up so there is still long way to go. 

 In the entire tyre pack, people have not looked at Balkrishna Industries in a very serious manner. This is one counter in the tyre space which one needs to look at current levels, it is an excellent company exporting to 120 countries. India being their manufacturing base, definitely in terms of cost advantage, it has huge advantage over global majors. Europe is their main market, US they have not developed that much but that is potential and I would not be surprised if it crosses 600 in the near future, maybe six months to nine months time."

However, Texmaco’s operating profit margin fell 230 basis points year-on-year (YoY) to 13.9% for the December ‘09 quarter and that’s despite a 43.4% growth in net sales to Rs 238.8 crore. Pressure on the company’s operating margins was due to key raw material costs as a percentage of net sales which rose to nearly 440 basis points YoY to 79.8% in the third quarter of FY10. The company’s key inputs include steel and allied products, and according to various estimates, domestic steel prices are higher by nearly 11% YoY in the third quarter, as domestic steel prices are quoting at a premium of 8-10% compared with the landed cost of imported steel. The company’s net profit was Rs 22.2 crore for the third quarter, a rise of 44.2% YoY, helped by lower interest costs and higher turnover. The quarterly results of Texmaco were declared after the close of trading on Wednesday, but the stock had declined 0.9% to Rs 162.5. However, over the past six months, the Street has been optimistic on the growth prospects of the company, and this stock has surged 94% compared with a 30.7 % rise in the Sensex during this period. In the case of Titagarh Wagons, its stock price had also risen 40.8% over the past six months. Texmaco had recently raised nearly Rs 170 crore through a QIP and it plans to use the funds raised for modernisation of its manufacturing units. It also plans to use a part of the proceeds to fund a joint venture with Australia-based United group for manufacture of metro coaches.The company also plans to diversify into other related business segments such as heavy castings and forgings and metal fabrication. Texmaco, trades at nearly 22.8 times on a trailing four-quarter basis. Rival, Titagarh Wagons trades at 16.8 times on a trailing basis and looks cheaper."

We are currently going through a phase of long term unusually low volatility. So this is a bull market but the moves are small. So we have been creeping up for quite a while and at the moment it looks that is exactly what we are going to continue doing for a while. Sure, in that light where do you think leadership will come from for the markets? Which are the stocks within the index which are looking the strongest on the charts right now for you? Well, this particular rally has once again got the same leaders that the past rallies have got, that is auto leading particularly Tata Motors and Mahindra not doing badly either this time and metal stocks have also once again picked up that momentum. The new sector which has not always been there in rallies but looks promising right now is cement, that sector is also doing quite well. Coming on some of these metal stocks that you feel attractive at this point in time from the metals pack. There is a good move happening as we speak in Sesa Goa. It is towards the high of the day. This little dip in the market has not affected it. So that looks quite a strong stock but even the Tata Steels are not very far behind. There is a good amount of momentum there. Hindalco has also made a good move. So it is across different metals as such. Sterlite has also been quite strong. So it is an overall wide base metal rally and as has often happened when the market is an intermediate uptrend, the metals go up. The only thing to look out for in metals is once there is an intermediate downtrend, they do tend to correct quite heavily as well. Stock specific to you, JP Associates, just announcing those cement despatch numbers up 60%, stock is showing some up move today as well. Yes, the stock has been a little quiet before today in the last two three weeks since this rally started gaining force but it is doing a bit of a catch up now and it is also at the high of the day. So this is reasonably promising but it is not at its bull market high. So the longer term trend in this stock is not that well established say auto or some of the other sectors. Question on cement, two specific stocks, UltraTech Cement and Binani Cement, both up close to 6% in today’s trade. Well, to take Binani Cement first, this has crept up really to the, it is the bull market high at about 75. It has come up there once or twice and then reversed. So now what has got to be seen is whether it stabilises above this level. If it does then it is onto a new bull market high which is really an affirmation that it is partaking in the bull market and in a strong uptrend, so that is really what is to be looked for over here. Apollo Hospitals? Apollo Hospitals if you look at the stock, it is for here’s and there’s it has tended to remain in a range. So as far as the long term is concerned of the stock, there is really very little happening here. Short term it makes sporadic moves and today would fall in that category. The very long term range in this stock has been something around 350-700 which it is approaching the top of until there is a breakout because it has not managed to do this since 2003. That is what we got to look for. Wheels India, that is up 20% today, is it looking good for more? This is not really that heavily traded a stock, so when you get a move which after days and months of inactivity takes place, one would not read too much into it but the interest today is definitely there. Today’s volume is perhaps higher than that of the last 8-10 days put together but this would not be the sort of move that I would get interested in this stock because it is a one off situation but somebody holding the stock should certainly hold onto it, it is up at the circuit and it is good payoff if people had been holding onto this stock patiently. From a trading angle, a short term target on MTNL given the momentum? Well, it is only now that there is some interest in this stock. It is first of all in the wrong sector. That sector has been doing very poorly and this stock has been of considerable disinterest to traders, its volumes have dropped but last three or four days, there is some momentum building up. If it is somebody is very speculative about it maybe, take a position, see what happens a day or two ahead but there are better options around. Ideas that you think look interesting, give us at least two of them for tomorrow morning? Well, continuation of the closing today, so Sesa Goa which I just mentioned earlier, that has had a good close and Tata Motors is always a very safe bet in a rally. It tends to be among the leading index stocks, so these two should be able to maintain where they have finished. I would not go with fertiliser yet because they were not doing very much before today. So I would wait for them to correct first and then look at buying them. You would avoid fertilisers, that has been established. You still want to monitor the momentum that we have seen in today’s session but aside of that, the other strong midcap movers whether it was the auto component space, the auto majors, some sporadic moves coming in on BOC India and the likes, what would be your pick, what is one trading position that you would carry forward into tomorrow?The problem at auto ancillaries is that they do not trade very heavily. So if you are looking for stocks which have say a futures contracts or so attached, you do not get too many auto components but if you look at the stocks as such, they have been doing pretty well right from the tyre industry to axels or any other auto components. So the auto sector is obviously giving them a boost, so anybody holding any of these stocks, they have good long term ideas and definitely need to be in there. The other sector not mentioned at all today but as budget approaches and since fertiliser is making the moves could be the rail stocks because already the volumes have picked up in all the Kalindee’s, (15:23) and Texmaco’s, so they could also be once again in the running before the budget."

ET Now: The buying that we have seen in IT and pharma and PSUs today, do you think that can continue into Monday morning? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: I think that can continue even till the 9th or 10th of this month because a lot of the rally that we have seen in cyclicals is kind of a hope-fuelled rally. And while it is nice to be hopeful, you would be much better off trying to enter stocks which have a) corrected and b) will benefit from a stable government. The tech stocks are going to benefit because they turn cyclically. So, a move up is probably round the corner. All the froth has gone, most people have gotten out of their tech stocks so this is a good time cyclically. People will get into the space because if something goes wrong the CNX IT will very quickly get back towards 10,000, and then these stocks will hedge your positions if you are planning to go long into the elections. So that way PSUs will do well. People are continuously building positions in PSUs regardless of the verdict. In any case, they are so dead and beaten up that they can only move higher. So probably the next week could be good for them."

 In dollar terms, TCS’ market valuation rose to $84 billion.TCS, the first Indian company to achieve the feat, had earlier crossed Rs 5 lakh crore market-cap in July this year.

"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tcs-signals-slowdown-brokerages-remain-unfazed-retain-rating/articleshow/32290558.cms,m.economictimes.com,"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating","NEW DELHI: After Infosys, India’s largest software company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has signalled that the March quarter is typically slower for them than the Dec quarter due to seasonality and fewer days.

Hence, Q4FY14’s QoQ revenue growth could be lower than the October–December quarter (Q3) at 3%, but “this should not be any indication of slowdown in demand,” clarified the management.

The management, however, has reiterated that the FY15 revenue growth would be higher than FY14, led by improvement in discretionary spending in the US and market penetration in Europe.

Key takeaways from TCS analysts meet highlighted the fact that near-term commentary remains soft, but the management retains its positive discretionary spend-led FY15 outlook.

TCS expects Q4 to be softer than Q3 in CC terms, growth to be led by Europe and Latam, and India to decline. But the management is confident of a strong outlook for FY15 over FY14. Margins, however, are likely to drop 40-50bps QoQ due to investments.

However, analysts at top brokerage firms are of the view that revenue growth will be seasonally low in the upcoming quarter, but overall trends look positive and currency will play a small role in Q4. But investors who want to remain invested in the IT space for long term should look at accumulating the stock on dips.

“Margin impact of currency fluctuations and reinvestments would likely be 40-50bps in Q4FY14. We adjust our FY14-15 estimates as per management commentary, but maintain our rating on TCS,” Barclays said in a note.

Barclays has incorporated the management commentary in their forecasts and consequently lowered their FY15-16 EPS estimates by 1.0 per cent. The global investment bank has revised its target price to Rs2,275 and maintains ‘equal-weight’ rating on the stock.

Earlier in the month of March, Bangalore-based Infosys spooked the street after chief executive SD Shibulal told investors the company was expecting to end the current fiscal year only near the lower end of its 11.5-12% guidance.

Reacting to the news, most brokerage firms reduced their respective target prices for Infosys. BofA-ML, Deutsche Bank and Barclays reduced their respective 12-months target prices by Rs 200-300.

But analysts are more confident this time on TCS and see more of a temporary phase for the company as management still remains confident about global operations.

Analysts expect the IT major to outperform industry on revenue growth as management commentary on demand trends for FY2015 continued to be reassuring, led by a favorable demand environment and market share gains.

“We expect TCS to outperform industry on revenue growth due to its superior market reach and excellent execution capabilities. We expect TCS to grow its USD revenues at a CAGR of 16.5% over FY2013-15 and EPS at a CAGR of 25% during this period,” Angel Broking said in a report.

	 
TCS has executed well over the past many quarters and currently trades at 18.5x FY2015E EPS. The Mumbai-based brokerage firm believes that TCS’ premium multiples are well deserved given consistency in performance and leadership in growth/profitability. They maintain their ‘buy’ rating on the stock.

Here are the views of five global brokerages firms on TCS post analysts’ meet:

Barclays:

The global investment bank has incorporated management commentary in their forecasts and consequently revised their FY15-16 EPS estimates downwards by 1.0 per cent. Their numbers imply 4.5% US$ revenue CQGR for FY15E compared to 3.6% witnessed in FY14.

Barclays’ revised the price target is Rs 2,275 (based on 18x weighted average of FY15-16E EPS) and they continue to maintain ‘equal-weight’ (EW) rating as they find valuations fair.

Goldman Sachs:

Goldman Sachs has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2122.55. It says EBIT margins should remain in a stable band, though we may see some impact (40-50 bp) as TCS continues to make investments in the business through penetrating newer geographies, service lines. Hence, it has maintained that margins may stabilize in the 27%-28% band in the long term.

Citigroup:

While Q4 is likely impacted by seasonality, management commentary on demand trends for FY15 continued to be reassuring. Expectations/valuations in TCS are the highest in the sector, and there could be limited upside from these levels. For investors who are looking for some upside in IT sector, Citi prefers Wipro and HCLT among the Tier 1 stocks.

Their target price of Rs 2,350 is based on 20x Mar'15E EPS. Citi estimates TCS' earnings will grow at a 23% CAGR over FY13-16E, and believed the stock should trade closer to the higher end of its historical five-year trading range of 7-24x 12-month forward earnings.

Morgan Stanley:

MS remains overweight on the stock. The global investment bank believes that management commentary about a weaker 4Q will keep expectations low going into the results. Overall, Morgan Stanley believes muted expectations for 4Q are unlikely to lead to any material change in the Street’s FY15 earnings expectations. The stock is trading at a premium to its peers (~19x FY15e and ~16x FY16e EPS), that could be sustained over the coming quarters.

Religare Institutional Research:

TCS valuations, though at a premium to the sector, have moderated to 19x FY15E earnings. Predictable growth and the ability to navigate margins will support TCS’s premium over the sector.

An improvement in demand outlook and continued execution would be the key stock triggers. Religare maintains ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,450."
Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/tax-free-bonds-regain-demand-in-the-secondary-market/articleshow/48059129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,"MUMBAI: Tax-free bonds which have been languishing for more than six months due to lack of investor interest in the secondary market, are in demand again.
 
 High networth individuals and some institutional investors are willing to invest in the instrument via the secondary market as they expect new tax-free series to offer lower rates on the back of expected fall in the benchmark yield and the odds for more rate cuts by the central bank have increased.
 
 “For HNIs wanting larger allocation, secondary tax frees will make sense, if there is some supply,” said Himanshu Bhagat, managing partner at IIFL Wealth. “Here (secondary market), we can then see some limited yield correction.”
 
 During 2013-14, Rs 49,200 crore of tax-free bonds were sold with rates offered in the range of 8.01-8.76% for 10-20 year maturities. Two years earlier, bonds worth Rs 48,000 crore were offered at a wide range of 6.82-8.30%.
 
 A week ago, the government mandated seven top-rated state-run companies to raise Rs 40,000 crore this financial year. Issuers are expected to start bond sales from this month-end in a phased manner. Sizable issues are expected in October-March, the period people plan their tax saving and have funds to invest.
 
 “HNIs and some cash-rich corporates are now keen to take bets on tax-free bonds via the secondary market as yields may fall five to 10 basis points,” said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income at Edelweiss Financial Services. “The new series could offer lower rates following the expected fall in the benchmark yield.”
 
 The benchmark yield on Monday rose six basis points to 7.86%, pushing prices down as an additional Rs 10,000 crore bond supply by the Reserve Bank of India added to the supply-side this week.
 
 But, good rains along with macro parameters will leave more rooms for the central bank for rate cuts this financial year. Lower interest rate in the market would pull bond yields lower. Also, the latest Greece debt deal has put a lid on speculation that the debt-ridden country would exit the European Union and prompt a market turmoil.
 
 On an average, the benchmark yield is expected to fall to the 7.50% level in the next three to six months, dealers said.
 
 Going by the incumbent benchmark yield as of now, an investor can earn as high as 7.25-7.5% by investing in the new series of tax-free bonds with 10-15-20 year maturities. Tax-free bonds will be priced after adding 45-80 basis points (varies on investor class and security rating) to the yield of similar-maturity sovereign bonds.
 
 “If the existing secondary market tax-free bond yields are near the 7.10-7.25% levels, it makes sense for HNIs (investing above Rs 10 lakh) to invest a portion of their money"", said Rupesh Bhansali, head-distribution at GEPL Capital.
 
 In the secondary market, 10-year triple-A rated tax-free bonds are yielding 7.15-7.25%. On 15-year paper, the yield is 7.25%.
 
 Yield on the National Highway Authorities of India’s 15-year tax-free bond has fallen five basis points in the past three weeks. Since the beginning of the financial year, this paper has seen transactions 15 times until July 9."
Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/tata-steel-q4-show-beats-estimates/articleshow/35138490.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel reported a consolidated profit of Rs 1,035.8 crore, beating market expectations, helped by higher sales volumes and better realisations in Europe and India. 

 Analysts, on an average, were expecting Tata Steel to report consolidated net profit of Rs 970.9 crore on sales of Rs 40,791.9 crore, according to a poll conducted by Bloomberg. The company reported a loss of Rs 6,529 crore during the same period last year, hurt by impairment charges. Sales rose 22% to Rs 42,428 crore from the same quarter last year. 

 Sales volumes grew to 7.6 million tonnes (MT) compared with 6.6 MT during the same quarter last year. Tata Steel board has recommended a dividend of Rs 10 a share for FY14. 

 Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortization (EBITDA) was Rs 4,917 crore from Rs 4,368 crore during same quarter last year. EBITDA per tonne rose in India and Europe but fell in South-East Asia. 

 Tata Steel Europe CEO Karl-Ulrich Köhler said that the Europe business is focussing on operating costs and will look to reduce costs through more internal measures. He acknowledged that the company continued to see pressure on margins. 

 “Europe is suffering from overcapacity, which means pricing power is limited. Since there was a decrease in raw material prices, the benefit of which will come with a lag effect, customers asked for lower prices,” Köhler said. Global iron-ore prices have fallen sharply in the last three months, putting downward pressure on steel prices. 

 Tata Steel Europe, known as Corus before the $13-billion buyout in 2007, accounts for more than half of Tata Steel’s total consolidated revenue. 

 The company, which has been severely hit by recession and overcapacity, has remained operationally positive for five straight quarters, driven by several restructuring measures and a slight uptick in demand in Europe. The company indicated at more restructuring in the coming year. 

 ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, showed ‘cautious optimism’ about the recovery in the continent about the business outlook for the rest of 2014, when it reported quarterly results last week. 

 Tata Steel is India’s largest private sector steelmaker by revenue. It has a production capacity of about 10 MT per annum in Jamshedpur and about 18 MT in Europe. The company is increasing steelmaking capacity in Kaliganagar, Odisha. The project will add about 3 MT in the first phase of expansion. 

 Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director, said the Kaliganagar will be commissioned this year. The company has already spent Rs 16,350 crore this year. However, on the impending interim order by the Supreme Court on illegal mining in Odisha, the company remained non-committal. “Each company has to be treated on merit. We are operating with all clearances. But as all good companies we have a plan B in place,” said Chatterjee. 

 He refused to elaborate on the plan. Gross debt rose to Rs 81,000 crore as on March 31, 2014 from Rs 76,500 crore three months back. On refinancing of debt, Chatterjee said: “it will happen, when it has to happen. We’ll take a call when it’s due.” Shares of the company jumped to a 22-month high and closed up 6% at Rs 452.15 per share on BSE on Wednesday."

  The automaker gained 4.91 percent to 1,945 yen in the afternoon, boosted by the report in the Asahi Shimbun.
  
  However, Suzuki denied the story, saying it had no plans to reduce its annual production of 800,000 engines for vehicles assembled at factories in Japan for domestic sales and exports.

  ""The engine output (in Japan) will not be reduced from 800,000 unless domestic demand falls,"" he said.
  
  Nonetheless the Asahi report encouraged buying.
  
  ""It's positive in the sense that the company will be able to better address the impact from the stronger yen,"" a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm told Dow Jones Newswires.

Maran makes open offer for SpiceJet,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/maran-makes-open-offer-for-spicejet/articleshow/6048600.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maran makes open offer for SpiceJet,"NEW DELHI: Sun TV Network promoter Kalanithi Maran has offered to buy 20% stake in SpiceJet from the public at Rs 57.76 each. If successful, it will give him majority stake, allowing him to go ahead with plans of rebranding the no frills airline.
  
  This follows a deal where Mr Maran in his individual capacity agreed to acquire 37.7% stake in Delhi-based budget airline from the promoter of the firm besides financial investor Wilbur Ross for around Rs 739 crore. He will have to shell out Rs 479 crore to buy the additional 20% stake.
  
  The open offer price is at 4.7% premium on the Monday’s closing price of Rs 55.15. The domestic airline, which now has permission to fly overseas to Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal, witnessed hectic trading of shares which soared over 6% in early morning trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It touched an intra-day high of Rs 59.55, only to close 1.61% lower from the last traded price on Friday. The open offer has been made by Kal Airways, a private firm promoted by Mr Maran and his wife Kaveri. It will open on August 6 and close on August 25.
  
  The new promoters propose to change the name of SpiceJet after completing the acquisition, which is expected to close next year. They also plan to shift its registered office from Gurgaon in Haryana to down South.
  
  Meanwhile, one of the co-promoters of the airline, Ajay Singh, who holds around 5% stake in the airlines said on Monday that he does not wish to exit at this point and will stay put in the budget carrier as the prospects are bright for low-cost carriers in the country.

  What is the call on SpiceJet?
   
  It has been into a very strong downtrend for quite a while and slammed down into supports near the 41-42 area. We did see a very large volume upside move from the lows today. So it is very clear that there are interests in buyers somewhere in the 40 to 42 region and that would remain a decent level of support to buy in. 
  
  I would not really chase this stock but looking at the very strong decline that we have had, certain bit of an upward bounce is not unrealistic and since the stock has been into a lower top lower bottom formation from somewhere in let’s say 97 levels to 42 levels, a decent pullback is on the cards. Stock is a decent bet, your risk levels are very close by. So with a target of about 65-67, this is a buy."

 Even after excluding the one-off income from sale and leaseback of aircraft and engine warranty claims, the Chennai-based airline has reported profits, mainly due to higher passenger traffic. Moreover, the performance follows five consecutive quarters of losses. 

 SpiceJet recorded a net profit of Rs 54.6 crore for the June quarter, compared with a net loss of Rs 71 crore a year ago, on the back of a 26% growth in passenger traffic. 

 The airline also witnessed a significant improvement in revenue per passenger, to Rs 4,068 from Rs 3,283 a year ago, which helped its net sales grow 51% to Rs 1,406 crore in Q1. Going ahead, it would be vital for SpiceJet to boost regional connectivity."

ET Now: NBFCs what do you do you speak to any company a small cap company like TFCI which in the investor conference yesterday guided very well. You were speaking to Capital First and the management comes on air tomorrow to speak about their future and they are sounding positive as well. Similarly for an SKS Micro. So almost every NBFC is talking very positively for the next couple of years at least. Do you have any preferences in this space do you like them at all? 

 
Dipan Mehta: I have mentioned on this channel as well that we have a preference for SKS Micro and within the NBFC space, there is a great deal of potential but investors are better off trying to venture into NBFCs which are specialised like SKS Micro into Microfinance and then there is Bajaj Finance and other company which we have an interest in.
 
 The same with Capital First which is more into SME funding. So wherever there are specialised NBFCs ,those will benefit because of the underlying volume growth that they are able to achieve, another segment of the NBFCs which is very interesting and lots of ideas over there would be the housing finance companies starting right from LIC Housing to Repco. 

 So on the whole, we are quite positive on the NBFC sector and they have demonstrated good growth rates, some amount of regulatory overhang also has got discounted with the new RBI norms for NBFCs. We have checked a lot of the companies are not getting affected as much as was thought earlier. So on the whole, it is great going for NBFCs and from shareholder point of view over the next three-four years.

As opposed to this, cement realisation of companies in the rest of the country has been erratic and in most cases, it has fallen.   	After following operational discipline due to overcapacity for a long time, south-based cement companies increased cement prices given the scope of new demand following the creation of two new states -Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is anticipated that there would be an incremental cement demand of 23 million tonnes (MT) which is higher than 20 MT which united Andhra Pradesh had during peak cement cycle.  	As a result, cement prices in south increased by Rs 20-50 per 50 kg bag in the September quarter. In contrast, with the exception of western region -where cement prices jumped in the range of Rs 20-40 per 50 kg bag - cement prices in North, East and Central regions have either declined or remained range bound due to weak demand.  	At present, cement utilisation in the South is in the range of 55-58% as opposed to 80% in the rest of India. As momentum in demand picks up in the region, cement prices are expected to rise in the coming quarters."

 ""SMX has introduced new commodity classes and products. Introduction of uniquely designed products for niche markets along with redesigning and restructuring of existing products, has been the key contributor to the growth,"" SMX CEO V Hariharan said in a statement here. 

 Research and product innovation has helped growth in volumes across all commodity classes. SMX has been expanding its reach in different countries and amongst different industry users, with the launch of the new products, new trade member categories and partnering at various levels with commodity and industry associations, Hariharan said. 

 SMX has witnessed a growth of 8 times during the last one year with the overall volumes growing from 399,775 lots to 3,238,569 lots and the average daily volumes growing from a mere 1544 lots to 12,553 lots. The month-wise average Open Interest has grown around 22 times, the release said."

ET Now: What are your views on the impressive performance on all fronts by Sintex? 

 
Dipan Mehta: The last two-three quarters have been quite spectacular for Sintex and after all the sort of internal changes in their business division, they have begun to focus more and more on the more profitable businesses. They have cut down on their working capital expenditure and on the whole the overall uptick in the economy also seems to benefit companies like Sintex Industries. So one would be extremely positive on Sintex.

Sintex bracing for better nos in March quarter,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sintex-bracing-for-better-nos-in-march-quarter/articleshow/5442313.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sintex bracing for better nos in March quarter,"Better synergies generated after the acquisition of subsidiaries helped Sintex show a flat consolidated performance during the quarter to December ‘09, although on a standalone basis, its performance was weak.The company’s profits for the quarter dipped 11.3% on a standalone basis to Rs 55.9 crore, but the consolidated numbers at Rs 72.8 crore were 1.5% higher compared with the year-ago period.Sintex had acquired six companies over the past couple of years – two in the US, one in France and three in India. The overseas subsidiaries had been hit hard by the economic turmoil over the past 18 months, but have now started looking up. However, following the company’s failed attempt at acquiring Geiger Tech in Germany, which filed for bankruptcy, Sintex is likely to write off its initial investment of E7 million (approx Rs 46 crore) during the current financial year.For the December quarter, the company reported a 3.4% growth in consolidated net sales to Rs 848 crore. However, rising raw material costs impacted its operating margin leading to a situation where its PBDIT is now below the year ago level. The company shaved off close to one-thirds of its interest costs by replacing high cost loans, which helped its pre-tax profit inch up 3.5% to Rs 98.8 crore. Its textiles business grossly underperformed during the quarter with a 6% dip in sales and 67% fall in profits. In comparison, the plastics segment performed well with a double-digit profit growth against the year-ago period. Sintex Industries’ December 2009 quarter financial performance failed to impress investors, as its shares dipped 0.8% to close at Rs 269 on BSE. The scrip, which has underperformed the Sensex during the past year, is now being valued at 12 times its consolidated earnings for the past 12 months.The company reported improving capacity utilisation rates across businesses, which can help boost higher revenues, going forward. With over one-thirds of its annual profits typically generated in the last quarter, the March 2010 quarter numbers could be substantially better. The company is also carrying a war chest of around Rs 800 crore of cash, initially raised to fund an acquisition, which could add an unexpected boost to growth."
"Cost cuts, reworked deals boost Siemens margins",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/cost-cuts-reworked-deals-boost-siemens-margins/articleshow/34415149.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Cost cuts, reworked deals boost Siemens’ margins","Internal controls appear to be paying off for Siemens, the Indian arm of Europe’s largest engineering company, Siemens AG. Its focus on cost controls and better project management is reflected in its financials.
 
 The company’s operating margins in the first half of FY14 improved to 6.5 per cent against the last six-quarter average of 3.7 per cent, though revenue growth slipped by 7 per cent.
 
 Siemens India’s financial year ends in September. In the past few quarters, the firm posted divergent margins, from as low as 1 per cent in the third quarter of FY13 to as high as 13 per cent in the second quarter of FY12.
 
 Analysts believe the main reason for such variance is its high exposure to currency risk.
 
 The company imports most of its raw material. Besides internal controls to boost margins, the company is also re-negotiating with its customers on price.
 
 Post the March earnings, the management stated there’s still significant amount of under-cutting to grab orders, and the difference between the lowest bidder and the next possible one ranges between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
 
 Adding to the woes of capital goods firms are the trade terms, which seem skewed in favour of the buyer, resulting in stretched payment schedules . The company says it will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and ignore lossmaking orders.
 
 The attempt by the firm to focus on profitable volumes has led to a slide in order inflow growth as it stays away from loss-making orders. The order inflow declined by 4 per cent to Rs 4,620 crore in the first half of FY14 against Rs 4,790 crore in the same period last year.
 
 It continues to see a decline in order inflow from infrastructure and energy, which contributed 48 per cent to total revenue in the March quarter. The order backlog stands at Rs 12,900 crore at the end of March 2014.
 
 Despite the stock appreciating by 41 per cent in the last six months, 73 per cent of analysts tracking it, have put a ‘sell’ call on it, influenced by its P/E ratio.
 
 According to Bloomberg, earnings per share (EPS) for the next year is expected at Rs 16.23, which means the stock is currently trading at a P/E of 47.5 times of one-year forward earnings.
 
 Given the headwinds of a demand environment and cut-throat competition, a 47 times of P/E for a stock like Siemens India appears to be quite expensive for investors. On earnings, net profit climbed 185 per cent to Rs 88.29 crore in the March quarter, while revenue declined by 8 per cent to Rs 2,706 crore on a y-o-y basis. The drop in revenue is mainly the result of clients deferring deliveries."
Shreyas Shipping's stock zooms 10-fold on turnaround,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shreyas-shippings-stock-zooms-10-fold-on-turnaround/articleshow/46211585.cms,m.economictimes.com,Shreyas Shipping's stock zooms 10-fold on turnaround,"MUMBAI: The shares of Shreyas Shipping & Logistics have jumped fourfold in the past three months and 10-fold in six months, as the coastal shipping company pulled through a spectacular turnaround in a depressed market. It closed 5% up at Rs. 408.10 on Wednesday after reporting its second consecutive quarter of net profit, after remaining in the red for the previous three.
 
 For the October-December period, the firm posted a net profit of Rs. 22.4 crore against a loss of Rs. 2.9 crore a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to Rs. 139.8 crore.
 
 Instead of cutting back or waiting for the external climate to change, Shreyas increased capacity, while simultaneously reducing cost per tonne of cargo. It sold two old vessels and replaced them with newer, larger and more fuel-efficient ships.
 
 “The strategic and decisive actions by the board resulted in this strong turnaround. Newer vessels and better capacity utilisation on higher cargo from transshipment and domestic market helped,“ said chairman and managing director Ramesh S Ramakrishnan.
 
 Shreyas did not attribute the turnaround to any significant rise in demand, but mostly to its internal change in strategy . It increased capacity utilisation by venturing into non-container cargo, like steel coils. That helped it increase utilisation of empty vessels on return journeys. The company hopes to buy more vessels going forward.
 
 Last year rating agency Crisil had expressed concern about volatility in bunker costs and slow growth of container traffic in India resulting in low utilisation of its fleet. Both these issues have been resolved to a great extent by falling fuel price, more efficient vessels and higher utilization rate.
 
 ""It is not a recent story. The company has been able to consistently improve its earnings in the last three quarters. Even the first quarter for the year would have been profitable without a one-time expense,"" said an analyst, who refused to be named. Shreyas' market cap stands at Rs. 268.83 crore.
 
 Coastal shipping — which commands a significant share of trade in the US, China and Europe — accounts for just 7% of the country's total domestic cargo transport network even as India has a coastline of more than 7,500 km."

  Once the budget is over, Educomp generally tends to decline but now it is broadly in the range of about Rs 400 to Rs 520. 
  
  On Bajaj Hindustan, upside seems to be limited. Most of these stocks were showing good momentum but now are broadly range bound between about Rs 60 and Rs 80 on Bajaj Hindustan. 
  
  There was a news expected on retail which never came through. So, Shoppers Stop has been ranging between Rs 320 and Rs 380. In case it is able to close below Rs 320, you probably may find levels of Rs 260, but generally it is a low volume stock and does not tend to do much but below Rs 320. There could be some Rs 40-50 downside."

 In accordance with the Council's recommendation, the Finance Ministry has decided to exclude Sesa Sterlite from the Fund's investment universe as well as to maintain the exclusion of Vedanta, it added. 

 ""The recommendation builds on an earlier recommendation to exclude the company Vedanta Resources Ltd (Vedanta) and two of its subsidiaries, which operate in India. The Ministry followed the Council's recommendation to exclude Vedanta and its two subsidiaries in 2007,"" the statement had said."

The bank’s London branch has raised the bond issue rated as BBB-. 

 Deutsche Bank was the sole investment banker for the issue, which was priced at 2.83%. The coupon is derived after adding 144 basis points over and above the five-year US treasury yields. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. 

 Praveen Kumar Gupta, DMD and CFO, SBI, has confirmed the matter. “This was a foreign borrowing for lending overseas only. It was through a normal borrowing route,” he told ET. 

 Those offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. With higher demand for Indian papers, the spread or gap, over and above the US treasury yields has contracted. However, US sovereign yields have gone up as prices have fallen with investors expecting US rate hikes sometime in June-July. 

 “We are getting an increased number of queries from institutional investors for Indian top-rated bonds,” said an investment banker engaged in offshore bond sales. 

 Earlier in February, India’s largest private sector company by revenue Reliance Industries raised $750 million by selling 30-year maturity offshore bonds. The yield spread was at 262.5 bps while US treasury yields had dipped to record lows as prices moved up. The final yield came at 4.875%.

 BSE’s Sensesx rose 63.24 points, or 0.24 per cent, to close at 26850.47. NSE’s Nifty gained 15.55 points, or 0.19 per cent, to close at 8011.45 on Thursday. Among the broadmarket indices, BSE’s mid-cap index gained 1 per cent and the small-cap index rose 1.5 per cent. Financial markets will be shut on Friday on account of Diwali. In commodities futures, turnover in gold and silver rose on the commodity exchange MCX.
 
 Usually, it is the trader community, which participates in the Muhurat trading session. They enter small token trades with an intention to book profits as making money in this hour of trading is considered auspicious. This could be the reason for the activity in mid-caps. But mid- and small-cap shares on the Muhurat trading session may not repeat their recent strong performance in Samvat 2071 as many of them are considered expensively valued after the recent rally. So far in 2014, mid-cap index has gained 44 per cent and small-cap index has gained 63 per cent.
 
 “In Samvat 2071, only quality stocks which are moderately valued will outperform the broader market and investors should not expect much from overvalued mid- & small-cap stocks,” said Nilesh Shah, MD and CEO, Axis Capital.
 
 Samvat 2070, which ended on Wednesday, has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The Sensex has risen over 26 per cent in this period.
 
 Brokers and investors are expecting similar returns this Samvat as the government has embarked on market-friendly measures to bolster the economy. But the road is unlikely to be smooth. Global markets are facing stiff hurdles from the euro zone, where concerns of a recession have resurfaced.
 
 Also, the era of easy global money may be coming to an end soon with the US Fed expected to increase interest rates mid-2015. There are worries that the flood of foreign institutional investor (FIIs) flows, which pushed up stock prices, may ebb once the Fed tightens its monetary policy. Though central banks in Europe and Japan continue to keep interest rates at near-zero levels, investors are not sure how much of that money would flow into emerging markets like India.
 
 For Indian stocks, the next big event will be the Union Budget for the financial year 2015-16. Investors are expecting the government to step on the gas on the reforms process with key state elections out of the way."
Sabero's growth prospects appear attractive,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/saberos-growth-prospects-appear-attractive/articleshow/6030013.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sabero's growth prospects appear attractive,"The crop protection major, Sabero Organics Gujarat (SOGL), has done exceedingly well on the bourses following its improved financial performance. Its stock has more than doubled in a span of one year, way ahead of the benchmark Sensex performance.
  
  SOGL’s profit for the fourth quarter more than tripled to Rs 7.1 crore, despite a 3% dip in the net sales at Rs 96.5 crore. Operating margin saw a 300-bps improvement to 15% as costs of raw material consumed fell 28%. 
  
  The performance of its domestic business improved in FY10. Domestic sales for the whole year grew 40% to Rs 180 crore representing 42% of the total sales of the company as against just 34% last year. In the case of its exports division, the sales also grew in the Americas region while Asia, Europe and Africa reported a drastic fall in sales.
  
  The proportion of debt in SOGL’s capital structure also got reduced during the year on account of a 15% equity dilution over the year and an 88% growth in net profit. Its debt-equity ratio dropped from 1.03 a year ago to 0.71.
  
  With more than 240 product registrations, Sabero operates on a wide network of distributors and agents in 50 countries. The company has its subsidiaries in Argentina, Europe, Australia and Brazil, with Europe and Brazil being the main focus areas to obtain registrations. The company is further expanding its international presence in the geographies of Costa Rica, Venezuela, the Philippines, Guatemala, Cameroon and Argentina. 
  
  The company is currently in the process of setting up an export-oriented plant of technical active ingredients at Dahej in Gujarat with an estimated capacity of 2650 tonnes per annum by December 2010. The capital cost of Rs 55 crore will be financed by a combination of $9-million external commercial borrowings and internal accruals. 
  
  Also, the company plans to increase the capacity of its Chloropyriphos plant by 50% until September 2010. Moreover, it is set to launch two new fungicides and two herbicides in the first half of FY11.
  
  It has announced a final dividend at the rate of Rs 1.20 per share for the year, which works out to a dividend yield of 1.6% at the current market price of Rs 73. This is 5.5 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share. Given the company’s expansion plans, its growth prospects appear attractive for the future."
Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/steep-appreciation-in-rupee-to-lower-oil-subsidies/articleshow/16591247.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,"MUMBAI: A steep appreciation in rupee is likely to help reduce India’s oil subsidies substantially. The rupee-dollar exchange rate recently dropped below the 200 day moving average (DMA), which is regarded as significant by technical analysts.
 
 A report by Emkay’s predicted the trend to continue further till the exchange rate reaches 51.9 — another 1.5% appreciation. This can knock off Rs 25,000 crore of under-recoveries for the petroleum industry in the remaining 6 months of FY13.
 
 Just a few weeks back India was looking at a fuel subsidy bill exceeding Rs 2 lakh crore or 2% of the country’s GDP. The recent increase in diesel prices, cap on LPG cylinders and tax changes is estimated to cut this down by Rs 25000 crore. But the recent rupee appreciation, if sustained, would knock off additional Rs 25000 crore from the under-recovery estimate over next 6 months
 
 The daily under-recovery of petroleum industry was estimated at Rs 498 crore for the second half of September 2012 in spite of the diesel price hike in the first half. This was at an average import price of Rs 6350 per barrel of India’s crude basket.
 
 Since then, the import price of Indian crude basket has fallen to Rs 5700 per barrel thanks to a 6.7% drop in international crude prices and 3.7% appreciation in rupee.
 
 
 
  
 
 Assuming this level remains stable through the remaining 6 months of FY13, the total under-recovery for the whole of FY13 — including Rs 84,000 crore for the first six months of the fiscal till September — would drop below Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
 
 The impact of such a drastic fall in subsidy bill would be improvement in risk profile of the country for foreign investors. This will lead to more forex flows and lead to a further improvement in rupee. Rupee’s appreciation would also make imports cheaper thereby tempering the domestic inflation, which is another economic challenge for the economy."

On Tuesday, RIL stock rallied over 3 per cent in intraday trade.
 
 On Monday, the stock closed at Rs 997.35, up 2%. Among foreign brokerage houses, the forecast from UBS is the most aggressive with a price target of Rs1,400 a year from now, while CLSA expects the stock to double over the next three years.
 
 Analysts say prospects will look rosier once there is clarity on gas price hike from the new government and the company comes up with plans for effective utilisation of the cash on its balance sheet which is about Rs 86,000 crore. RIL has lined up large-scale capital expenditure plans in retail, telecom, and petrochem which is expected to boost operating profits in coming years.
 
 Shares of RIL have risen only 11.5% this year, underperforming the benchmark index. BSE Sensex has rallied 21.5% over the same period. On Saturday, RIL reported a consolidated net profit of almost $1 billion, up 13.7%, for the first quarter of the current financial year 2015."
Rice procurement crosses 20o lakh tonne,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/rice-procurement-crosses-20o-lakh-tonne/articleshow/7523215.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Rice procurement crosses 20o lakh tonne,"New Delhi: Rice procurement in the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS- October 2010-September 2011) by government agencies has crossed the mark of 200 lakh tonne (20mt) mark upto February 17 but is slightly lower than procurement same time last year.
  
  Official figures released on Friday said 2,13,09,532 tonnes of rice have been procured by the various government agencies upto Thursday, with Punjab leading the States. Buys by the state government stood at 86,33,706 tonnes of followed by Chhatisgarh and Andhra Pradesh at 27,82,753 tonne. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh bought 16,57,437 tonnes and 16,54,640 tonnes respectively.
  
  Food Corporation of India (FCI) had procured 21.88 mt of rice in the year-ago period. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) chairman and MD Siraj Hussain had estimated that government rice buys would reach 32 mt in the 2010-11 marketing year starting October this year, beating the target of 31 mt, despite drought in some parts of Bihar and UP. Compared to this, government agencies had procured 31.47 mt of rice in 2009-10 marketing year (October-September). According to the second advance estimates released by the ministry earlier this month, rice output is projected to surge to 94.01 mt this year against 89.13 mt last crop year (july-june). Last year, rice output had declined by over 10 mt due to drought in 2009-10 crop year.
  
   India, the world's second largest rice producer, produced a record 99.18 million tonnes of rice in 2008-09. Official data for rice procurement for the past 11 years shows the government agencies procured 18.228 million tonnes in 1999-2000, 21.28 million tonnes in 2000-2001, 22.129 million tonnes in 2001-02, 16.411 million tonnes in 2002-03, 22.828 million tonnes in 2003-04, 24.683 million tonnes in 2004-05, 27.656 million tonnes in 2005-06, 25.075 million tonnes in 2006-07, 26.305 million tonnes in 2007-08, 33.684 million tonnes in 2008-09 (24.869 million tonnes up to 16 March). In 2009-10, 31.47mt of rice was bought."
Recent buyouts to drive Religare's growth ahead,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/recent-buyouts-to-drive-religares-growth-ahead/articleshow/7512717.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Recent buyouts to drive Religare's growth ahead,"The performance of Religare Enterprises in the December quarter was disappointing. However, its recent acquisitions are expected to drive its growth in the coming quarters. The strong 74% growth in the consolidated revenue did not trickle down to profits since the company did not get support from its asset management and investment banking business segments. 
  
  Its lending business, which drives almost half of its consolidated revenues, saw the interest yields contracting. Coupled with rising interest rates, this led to a 42% fall in the net profit for the segment. Further, its subsidiaries re-ported a combined loss of Rs 87.4 crore. Therefore, the company re-ported a loss of Rs 98.5 crore against a profit of Rs 21.5 crore a year ago on a consolidated basis. However, the company is taking various initiatives to drive business growth. 
  
  Its key global asset management and investment banking divisions have seen a spate of acquisitions . For instance, the global asset management business acquired Northgate Capital and Landmark Partners in 2010. This has given the company access to assets under management of $11.3 billion (Rs 56,000 crore) along with greater capabilities in primary and secondary private equity, venture capital and real estate segment. Its investment banking business acquired three companies in the December quarter. 
  
  Besides providing geographical diversification, these acquisitions would help in reducing the turn around time in the regions . Investment banking business is relationship driven. Once the integration with the target companies completes, the company would be able to fully capitalise on the target’s relationships. This would help the company in generating profits at a fast pace. 
  
  Moreover, the effect of rising interest rates on its lending business would fade away, as almost 62% of its financing book is floating rate in nature. Hence, the increase would be passed on to the borrowers. While the company has invested heavily in its key driving businesses, the future growth depends upon how fast the company finishes the integration with the acquired companies."

  Well the stock is an excellent long term uptrend. It didn't fall very much during the markets correction of the last month or so. 
  
  Today's fall isn't keeping with market conditions. I would not think this fall will last very long either for the market or for REC so even REC could be picked up into a bit of a decline and keep a stop loss about a 1%-2% down from here that should workout reasonably well."

In the past few days, a spurt in rains in western Rajasthan has accelerated pulses sowing in the state, kindling hopes of recovering pulses acreage deficit.
 
 According to the latest sowing data, the total coverage under pulses is 74.48 lakh hectare as against 89.34 lakh hectare last year in the corresponding period.
 
 Out of the overall deficit of 14.86 lakh hectare, Rajasthan alone accounts for 12.6 lakh hectare.
 
 “Rajasthan contributes 45% of the total moong production in the country. If pulses sowing picks up, we can recover the deficit in pulses. Moong, which takes only 2 months for harvesting, can be sown till August 15,” agriculture secretary Ashish Bahuguna told ET.
 
 The pulses area is also likely to replace the acreage targeted for coarse cereals, which is dismally down due to deficient rains in the major coarse grain growing states of Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
 The area under coarse cereal is 140.89 lakh hectare as against 175.14 lakh hectare last year. “Most of these areas will be covered by pulses and fodder crops. Farmers usually divert to going pulses and fodder crops if nothing grows as pulses need less water and the life cycle is short,” said IMD chief LS Rathore.
 
 The government has a programme in place to achieve more than 19 million tonnes of pulse production."

 Both metals had, in fact, outperformed the MSCI World and the MSCI Emerging Index by a huge margin on a yearto-date basis. Gold has returned 9% in 2014 so far, which is one of highest returns on a YTD basis since 1983, while silver gained 11%. 

 The equity index has largely been flat, or 3-4% negative on a YTD basis. The crucial factor that bought the sheen back to metals is the re-emergence of ‘risk on’ trade and investors moving out of equity instruments. In the age of flight to safety, money pulled out of emerging markets on ‘increased country risk’ is being invested back in gold/silver. 
  
 The trades, based on the notion of ‘sell emerging markets and buy metals’ which led to the spread between MSCI Emerging Markets and gold spot, reversed on heightened risk perception from January 23, this year."

  What should one do with Pipavav Shipyard? If you had bought the stock at the Rs 80 levels, would you advise booking out or if you have not got into the stock, would you initiate a long at these levels?
   
  The first part is pretty easy because if you had got in at Rs 80, then you could possibly take some profits off the table but on a two or three week of basis, the stock looks likely to have more upsides from these levels also. Possibly Rs 105-110 are good targets with two or three week kind of horizon for Pipavav Shipyard. You could look to add to quantities if you do not have it.

Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: We are just seeing the uptake that is coming on Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy. Now with the news out that Ranbaxy will sell the generic drug rights to Torrent Pharma and the drug sale will meet the fair trade norm for the Sun Pharma merger I believe that decks are being cleared for that. What would your view be on Sun Pharma essentially because Ranbaxy is just a derivative of that now? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: By and large, I have been quite positive on the pharma space, especially those which are exporting to the United States of America because along with IT, these two sectors should do much better other than the domestics in this FY15 and FY16 as well. So for me these will be more positive sectors where the visibility is more assured than what we are seeing because on the domestic side, you are seeing more and more uncertainty. There is more and more risk building up. So for me, I would definitely go for the pharma sector and Sun Pharma would be one of those companies."

  One word on Biocon as also some other pharma stocks?
   
  Biocon has been quite a good stock since the bear market bottomed out in 2008 before that it was since the IPO sort of going flat or even down most of the time. But since then it has really been quite strong and even now to bottoming out in February after a bit of a correction it has had a slightly sharp correction in April, it has to be said but it is coming back to the levels it has reached this year. 
  
  The highs it has reached about Rs. 390 and it does look like a long term uptrend in the stock. So I think fairly good for investors. Just a downside can be a little sharp in this occasionally."

At the higher end, this is 10% lower than the profit recorded last year.

ONGC: Subsidy burden takes a toll; stock up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ongc-subsidy-burden-takes-a-toll-stock-up/articleshow/8659527.cms,m.economictimes.com,ONGC: Subsidy burden takes a toll; stock up,"Government-owned ONGC reported more than 60% sequential decline in net profit in January-March as it gave away about two-third of its oil revenues to subsidise losses of retailers amid soaring crude prices, reviving memories of fiscal 2008-09 when global crude peaked pushing up subsidies on fuel. 
  
  At 10:53 am, shares of ONGC were trading 0.77 per cent up at Rs 280.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The huge sequential fall in earnings stands in sharp contrast to private sector explorers such as Cairn India, which reported 22% growth in net profit helped by higher prices even though production fell. 
  
  ONGC's share in subsidy at Rs 12,135 crore in the fourth quarter was almost equal to the total of past three quarters. This took the total subsidy toll to Rs 24,892 crore for fiscal 2010-11, more than double than previous year. 
  
  In January-March, although ONGC earned an average oil price of $108.90 per barrel, it ended up with just $38.75 in hand as the government took away the rest. What remained was nearly 25% below the year-ago period causing a 26% fall in net profit. 
  
  State-run fuel retailers sell products such as diesel and cooking gas to end-customers at subsidised rates. The subsidy burden arising from selling the products below market price is shared between retailers, upstream companies, and the government. 
  
  The company reported net profit of Rs 2,791 crore in the last quarter driven by higher profits on natural gas, whose prices were revised in fiscal 2010-11, and increasing share of production from joint ventures. As there is no subsidy burden on production from joint ventures, the 60% incremental volumes helped. 
  
  Although oil prices have jumped more than five times since 2004-05, ONGC's average profit growth has been a mere 6.5% per annum. The average annual growth in its market capitalisation was just about 4.5%. Every year, the government has taken away a chunk of its profits to pay for losses made by oil marketing companies. 
  
  The subsidy sharing mechanism and its value-destructing impact will keep weighing on investor sentiment. The government is expected to divest its stake further in the company in early July. 
  
  This could induce the government to introduce some reforms for a better price. Investors, who are otherwise living off the annual dividend payouts, may look forward to a run-up in prices if the follow-on offer materialises."

 FOB is used when liability and ownership of goods is transferred from a seller to a buyer. 

 SEA further stated that soybean meal export is at the lowest level as Indian shipment is still outpriced in the international market. 

 Current price of soybean meal FOB Kandla (Gujarat) is quoted at USD 675 per tonne, while soybean meal Argentina CIF Rotterdam is quoted at USD 548 per tonne and Brazil at USD 534 per tonne.

The stock has been up over the past one month.The scrip has gained 41% in one month, notwithstanding the sluggishness in the broader market. The benchmark Sensex posted a modest return of 2.7% during the period. Nilkamal’s performance on the bourses stands out taking into account the returns for the three months, six months and one year.For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 64%, and it has more than trebled in six months. The Sensex returns lagged behind in each of these periods. Compared to the year-ago level, its current price of Rs 245 is four times higher. Nilkamal, which grossed Rs 564 crore in the past four quarters in revenue, manufactures injection moulding products, including home furniture. It had posted net losses in the second half of FY09. The trend, however, has reversed since then. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters. This was largely aided by a significant drop in raw material prices due to a relative softening in prices of petrochemical intermediaries, including polyethylene and polypropylene. As a result, input costs as a percentage of sales fell sharply from 71% a year ago to 59% in the September.Lower costs have resulted in improved profitability. From the lows of 7% in the March 2009 quarter, operating margin expanded to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. At the current price, the scrip commands a P/E multiple of 15 on a trailing 12-month basis. Other injection moulding makers, including Supreme Industries and Wim Plast, are trading at a P/E of nine and seven, respectively. Nilkamal’s higher valuations partly reflect its financial recovery and its expansion plans for plastics retail. The company is investing in its own retail chain under the name @Home across the country. In the September 2009 quarter, it opened two new stores under this brand. At the current level, the stock seems to fully reflect its future potential to expand."

  The aluminium major has approved 1:1 bonus, that is one bonus share for each share held, while taking into account the Q3 results in its Board Meeting held on January 31.
  
  “There has been consistent demand by shareholders to give bonus keeping the profit and heavy reserves in mind. By enhancing the number of shares and reducing the price for each share, the float and liquidity of the share shall be enhanced in stock exchange,” Nalco director, finance B.L. Bagra on Wednesday told “The ET”.
  
  “This is also expected to increase the market capitalization and enhance value to the shareholders,” Mr Bagra added.
  
  Nalco’s paid-up capital of Rs.644.31 crore would stand enhanced to Rs.1288.62 crore, without any cash consideration, once the Board’s resolution is endorsed by the shareholders in a meeting likely to be convened in March 2011.
  
  By amending the Article of Association, Nalco also has created a provision for issue of ESOP that is shares to its employees. The ESOP is planned to be issued to the executives of the company as part payment of dues to them under performance related payment (PRP), a component of revised pay package. The detailed scheme of ESOP, including price, is yet to be finalized, Mr Bagra clarified."

ET Now: What is the view on NALCO? 

 
Avinnash Gorakssakar: NALCO definitely looks attractive at current price levels if one takes the longer term kind of picture. Clearly, from the regulatory point of view, I have not heard any kind of negative news flow on it. 

 If one were to take a slightly longer term call, a year down the line, definitely this stock can offer a good upside. At this level, the downside looks pretty well protected.

  The company registered impressive results both in sales and profit for 2010-11, a company statement said here.
  
  According to the audited financial results for the year 2010-11, taken on record by the Board of Directors in a meeting held in New Delhi today, NALCO has posted net profit of Rs 1069.30 crore, registering an increase of 31 per cent over previous year's figure of Rs 814.22 crore.
  
  Similarly, the sales turnover of Rs 5958.98 crore, also showed a rise of 18 per cent, from Rs 5054.73 crore achieved in the previous fiscal.
  
  ""The results would have been still better but for the adverse impact of exchange rate of rupee on sales, which made a dent of Rs 159 crore,"" a senior executive said.
  
  The rise in net profit and sales turnover is mostly attributed to better market realisations, in addition to some contributions by way of higher production and sale of metal.
  
  During the year, average sales realization per tonne of alumina has gone up to USD 350 from USD 264 in 2009-10. Similarly, average sales realization per tonne of aluminium metal jumped to USD 2335 from USD 1946 in the previous year.

  Let’s start with your No. 1 stock idea for next 6 months for our viewers.
   
  My first recommendation is Munjal Auto. Munjal Auto is a Hero Group company which is managed by Sudhir Munjal. It is an automobile ancillary company catering mainly to the 2 wheeler industry. 
  
  This company’s main products are muffler, second is motorcycle rims and third one is scooter wheels. This company has 3 factories. One at Baroda, second at Haryana and third one is at Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Equity capital of this company is 10 crores. 
  
  In the year 2010-2011, this company made a turnover of Rs 521 crores and they made a gross profit of Rs 40 crores and net profit of Rs 25 crores. So on an equity capital of Rs 10 crores, the earning per share was Rs 25. 
  
  The company's management believes in rewarding the investors and hence they have declared Rs 7.5 as dividend. In the current year, in the first 9 months, the company has achieved a turnover of Rs 500 crores and gross of Rs 41 crores and net profit of Rs 30 crores. So one can see that the company has achieved more profit than what is achieved in the last full year."

  How does Mundra Port look on the charts?
   
  Mundra Port corrected quite a bit in the last one month. It has come down about 10-11%, which is much heavier than the index. But today's move looks quite interesting. It is straight off to about a week's high and if this sustains, then that could be pretty much the end of the correction. Otherwise the long-term chart of this stock looks pretty decent. It bottomed out in February. It did not have much of a bear market. So, there seems to be an excellent amount for the stock certainly at around Rs 130, that's held out very nicely for quite a while now and we are not too far above that level. So, if somebody likes the stock, this is not too bad an opportunity to get in, as I said the medium-term correction maybe just about coming to an end now."
MRPL surges on Colombian crude buy plan,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/mangalore-refineries-and-petrochemicals-ltd/5,economictimes.indiatimes.com,HOLAXD,HOLAXD
"MRPL: Outlook positive due to better margins, capex",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/mrpl-outlook-positive-due-to-better-margins-capex/articleshow/7464730.cms,m.economictimes.com,"MRPL: Outlook positive due to better margins, capex","MUMBAI: The 21% net profit growth that Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) posted for the December 2010 quarter could have been better if the heavy forex gains of last year were not taken into account. Hence, the company’s performance should not be judged from the reaction of stock market.
  
  The MRPL scrip got a severe beating on Wednesday as it fell more than 8% to its 52-week low in spite of a healthy December quarter show. 
  
  At the operational level, the company’s performance was much better, with gross refining margins at $6 per barrel and highest ever throughput of 3.49 million tonne. 
  
  The company’s operating profit grew 87% against the year-ago period. However, the Rs 153-crore foreign exchange gains it had booked last December meant that the growth in gross profit was just 14%. 
  
  Another factor that affected profit growth during the quarter was the provisions for pay revisions of non-managerial staff. The company wrote off Rs 56 crore during the quarter towards arrears of pay revisions with effect from April 2007.
  
  The company is working on a mega-investment programme, which will almost triple its gross block by end FY12. It is implementing a Rs 14,000-crore refinery expansion project to be completed by October. This will not only expand its refining capacity from 12 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes, but also improve its ability to process cheaper varieties of crude oil, which are heavier or with higher sulphur content. 
  
  Another major project will add 0.44 million tonnes of polypropylene capacity by April 2012 at a capital cost of Rs 1,800 crore.
  
  MRPL is also working with ONGC to set up an aromatics complex in a special economic zone near its refinery in Mangalore. The Rs 5,750-crore project is scheduled to be commissioned by end FY13. 
  
  Considering the recent fall in market value and gains in corporate earnings, the company’s valuations dipped to a price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 12.3. The global refining industry appears to have come out of the woods with gross refining margins, or the money a refiner makes on refining each barrel of crude oil, moving up in the December quarter. The first few weeks of the March 2011 quarter indicate that the strength continues, which can prove a key positive for the company going ahead."

  On the back of a strong recovery in the vehicle sector MRF stepped up net sales by 22.38% to Rs 1653.84 crore (Rs 1351.30 crore). Other operating income netted Rs 2.46 crore (Rs 67 lakhs).
  
  It reported a marginal six per cent rise in total expenditure at Rs 1471.18 crore (Rs 1388.57 crore). Company sources rubber prices had remained same as in the previous two quarters. But, in Q1, cost of petroleum derivatives had come down. The company incurred higher cost on employees and depreciation charges due to the capex.

ET Now: MRF numbers bring me to that tyre space because funds are actively buying into the tyre companies. We saw evidence of that yesterday with JK Tyre. The stocks are trading at fresh 52-week highs and they are continuing unabated. The Ceat QIP II on right now. what do you make of this space and particularly MRF as well with another quarter of very robust numbers? 
 
 
Dipan Mehta: In the last two-three years, the tyre companies have done exceedingly well. Certain amount of pricing discipline has come through and capacities have not come in place. At the same time, demand has increased pretty well and some of the export markets also have opened up for lot of these tyre companies and, of course, the final benefit was account of lower raw material cost especially rubber and all those benefits are flowing to the top line and the bottom line for most tyre companies. If you see in terms of performance, MRF had a bit of a laggard but after this result, one could clearly conclude that definitely the company has caught up with his peer group and maybe from this point on, it may even do better than its peer group considering its dominant position within the industry.
 
 
ET Now: Right but which is your top bet when it comes to the tyre space. MRF is an expensive stock but nevertheless it has had a strong run?
 
 
Dipan Mehta: Well some of the smaller tyre companies like TVS Srichakra and to an extent even Balkrishna Industries look quite interesting but Balkrishna came out with disappointing set of numbers. So we just like to hold our recommendation over there but TVS Srichakra continues to do exceedingly well and it is kind of a niche player. So that would be the preference but after these numbers of MRF, one would need to look at MRF more closely and understand exactly what went right for the company and that could also turn out to be a good investment opportunity."

ET Now: On the charts Lupin? 

 Rajen Shah: I continue to be extremely bullish on the MNC pharma space. All pharma companies have moved up. Lupin, Wockhardt and a number of other midcap companies have also done very well. But I am a big fan of MNC pharma companies, so I believe that companies like Merck, Wyeth, Novartis, Pfizer are quoting at one-fifth or may be one-tenth of the market cap, what they are quoting in US, not even one-tenth, in fact, much lesser than what they quoting in US. 

 With India probably opening up more and more in future this all MNC companies will certainly try to expand their presence in India because so far they have been neglecting their subsidiaries. You see the market cap of Merck, Wyeth, Novartis and Pfizer, this is peanuts actually. Probably we could also see some delisting thing happening in case of MNC pharma companies. 

 So I feel that the opportunity in the pharma industry is huge so probably these parent companies may get more serious because they have been so far not taking that keen interest in their subsidiaries, so I am a big fan of MNC pharma at these levels.

 The state-run company has been looking for investors to offload its 26 per cent stake in the commodity bourse, Indian Commodity Exchange (ICEX), which wound up its operations towards the end of 2013. Currently, MMTC holds 5.20 crore equity shares in ICEX at a face value of Rs 5 each.
 
 ""The board of directors has ""approved the proposal for sale of 10 per cent of ICEX equity i.e. 5 per cent each, to two bidders who participated in the global tender against the present holding of 26 per cent in ICEX by MMTC at Rs 10 per share subject to the approval by the government and the Forward Markets Commission,"" the company said in a filing to BSE.
 
 ICEX does not have sufficient net worth and requires infusion of funds from existing shareholders as well as investment from fresh shareholders. However, MMTC is is not interested in infusing more funds to increase the net worth of the exchange to meet the regulatory norms, a PTI report said.
 
 MMTC had invited bids for purchase of a minimum 20 lakh shares (equivalent to 1 per cent shareholding in the bourse) at a minimum reserve price of Rs 10 a piece.
 
 The stock has lost 96 per cent of its market capitalisation in the past five years. The offer for sale (OFS) for 10 per cent of its stake in June 2013 was priced at a 72 per cent discount to the then prevailing stock price. Later in the year, FMC had issued a show-cause notice to ICEX, scrapping its registration because no business has been generated on the exchange since December 2013.
 
 During the end of 2013, the ICEX had decided to wind up operations and trading was accordingly suspended on December 24, 2013 after the business volumes got affected due to several factors including imposition of commodity transaction tax and the Rs 5,500 crore payment scam at NSEL.
 
 Other stakeholders in ICEX include Reliance Exchange Next with 26 per cent, IBFSL and Abhinay Trading Corporation's 14 per cent each, Indian Potash Ltd with 10 per cent, while KRIBHCO and IDFC hold five per cent each in the exchange."
Metal cos are having good volume growth',positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/metal-stocks-are-more-than-just-a-one-hit-wonder/articleshow/82516088.cms,m.economictimes.com,Metal stocks are more than just a one-hit wonder,"Let us not assume that the rally in metal stocks is a one-time story, it could be a compounding story as well, says Charandeep Singh, Founder & MD, Girik Capital in this interview. Also in conversation is Varun Daga, Co-founder & Fund Manager, Girik Capital. Edited excerpts:

How you are looking at the overall set up for the equity markets? The on-ground situation is adverse because of Covid and the FIIs are also continuously pulling out money.
Varun Daga: The market, as we always say, has a mind of its own and is now probably looking into the future. From the earnings side, we have had some good news as many sectors did well. So on the market front, things are looking alright. Markets are not willing to sell off that easily. The bull market looks robust. We have seen pockets of overvaluation at some places, but the overall market looks fine.

Before the second wave, we were doing so well across all sectors and this (Covid 2.0) was a setback. But hopefully, if things get back to normal on the economy side, the market is waiting for that issue to get sorted. Fundamentally, we do not see any big reason (for selloff). Domestic demand might get a little affected but there are a lot of opportunities on the exports side.


How will the inflation in raw material prices impact the FMCG sector, given its high valuation?

Charandeep Singh: There are headwinds in consumption-oriented sectors. There is no doubt that many of these companies are performers. But you have an earnings headwind over here because of commodity price inflation and the consumer slowdown in general. So it is possible that you may not get the desired outcome in terms of long-term IRR in this sector.


One often wonders as to how long is the metals rally going to last. Copper and other base metals are hitting fresh all-time highs. Do you feel that there is more upside left or would you say that the best is behind us?
Charandeep Singh: The last time you saw metals performing was in the rally from 2001 to 2008, and then a little bit at the beginning of this decade. It is very important for us to understand that the profit pools in a lot of these metal companies are cyclical. In the last decade, there were demand headwinds and many of these companies did not make good capital allocation decisions. The markets tend to react in an excessive manner, both pessimistically and optimistically, when it comes to cyclicals. 

But to paint all the companies in the sector with the same brush is not fair. This rally could also be because of restructuring in some of these metal companies in the last decade. They have cleaned up their balance sheets and divested non-core assets. This sector has got consolidated in a large way. In steel, for example, the top 4-5 steel producers in India produce bulk of the metal now. Through the NCLT procedure, a lot of valuable assets got gobbled up. 

The second thing you have is better asset allocation incrementally. Third thing, I would say, is that the best steel companies in India produce a decent return on capital and have a very secular demand scenario. So if you look at them over the last 25-30 years, they have done volume growth north of GDP and that is quite commendable. 

In the near-term, they are benefiting from a great pricing scenario globally. If you are selling 50% more metal, then you have a great chance of creating more operating leverage, especially if you are capital disciplined. 

Let us not assume this is a one-time thing or just a reset. It could be a compounding story as well. We should be open to that.


Is the rerating in speciality chemicals going to continue going forward? Are there opportunities or would you say that the best is in the price already?
Varun Daga: To a large extent, the multiple re-rating is probably done. But in terms of the opportunity size, it is huge. India is a hub for manufacturing and all these companies have become sizable ones now. They are generating enough capital on their own and do not really need to borrow money. So they can take up contracts from anywhere in the globe and produce at the cheapest cost. 

Having said that, they have run up a lot but all we have to focus is on growth and the size of opportunity. There are times when the market corrects and you get enough opportunities where some of these good businesses can be bought.


On pharma stocks
Varun Daga: I do not think the best is behind for pharma. It is a very typical sector because every company has its own fundamentals. There are different sectors within pharma - APIs, formulations, domestic and exports. You need to pick leaders in different areas. The story is still under play and they have better times ahead."

I know it is a truncated trading week but nevertheless it is a very big week for our markets. Are there more legs to this rally? Is the washout of a festive season and supply disruptions getting sorted out?If you see the market patterns, for almost six months now, there has been a very smart rotation at play wherein at different points of time, different sectors are performing. Some sectors are going through a bit of a lull and depending upon the triggers and the developments, certain other sectors are coming into limelight. 
 
Auto has been a performing sector for a while but in the two-wheeler space, the overall performance has not been that great because of the lack of demand. We are not seeing much of an excitement there but the Q2 numbers of most of the companies had indicated that the worst of the chip supply is behind them and gradually we will see the revival in terms of supply. Malaysian chipmakers starting to work at 100% capacity and smart chip issues receding came as a big positive surprise wherein there is a sense that growth will come back.
 
But one has to bear in mind is that the entire update on the improvement in chips is not going to benefit all the companies across. We feel that companies like Maruti and Motherson Sumi would be a bigger beneficiary of this development whereas the companies which are relying upon the European suppliers like JLR and some other global companies, may not benefit immediately. We like Maruti and Motherson Sumi as top picks both in the OEM and auto ancillary space. There is some more leg in terms of the upside for these two names.
 

Out of the three listed stocks and it will be four tomorrow, which is the one new tech stock you think should be part of everyone’s long-term portfolio where you may see a hit of 25% but it should be part of the core portfolio like a HDFC Bank in 2000 or Bajaj Finance in 2010?Even though IPO valuations have been on the higher side, we are seeing that post listing, the overall momentum and the activity around the IPOs have been exceptionally good. We are bringing in a lot of optimism in terms of what sort of growth these companies can throw up over the next three, five, seven years. 
 
Given the sort of dynamics that we are working with, we would really want to focus upon names where at least the basic product or the platform is showing a lot of promise in terms of traction and the management pedigree or the guys who are backing these companies are good. From that perspective, both Zomato and Nykaa are looking pretty promising in terms of what they have built so far. There is no point talking about valuations. It is all about what sort of growth in terms of top line or certain parameters that the market is looking at. We have to have a smaller allocation to these companies if we have to make them part of the portfolio. We have to see how over a period of time, they perform but these two names definitely are looking quite promising in terms of what they have built so far.
 

Which is your favourite unlock trade? Hotel, hospitality, travel, fashion?Retail like Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent are the names where we have seen very remarkable growth come back into the system. The sense we are getting is that the growth from here on is going to be much better. So definitely in terms of open up themes, we like these two names.
 
Apart from that, of course, Indian Hotels has been something that we have been liking a lot and given the fact that in the second half, the general occupancy levels are much better and this time around both in terms of business travel as well as the leisure travel we have seen a good traction. Travel is going to catch up big time over the next two quarters. 
 

In the pre Covid era, hotel stocks were not great wealth creators. Just because Covid has happened and they are making a comeback, some of those stocks are at a new high. Why should we go and buy hotel stocks because they still need capital and the return ratios are cyclical?A good insight. Our take is that you will see some sort of a consolidation play out in the last 12-15 months of this pandemic wherein smaller hotel units have shut down and the bigger guys have consolidated and a lot of cost controls have happened because of the way things have been for the hospitality sector. There are advantages of a much better positioning in the hospitality space, cost controls and the fact that the way things are going to shape up, the pricing environment and the occupancy levels are going to be much better.
 
The entire operating leverage could play out over the next 12-18 months and that would lead to some sort of a rerating of the larger players. I agree that it has not been one of the best performing sectors in terms of wealth creation, but from a technical positioning, given the way things have been, we think there is going to be a lot of excitement around the numbers that these companies are going to throw up and that could lead to some sort of a rerating.
 

We have also started seeing the API focus pharmaceutical stocks make a comeback. How are you approaching this entire sector now that the base effect of Covid will also no longer be at play?One thing which Covid and the entire sequence of events which happened in the last 12-15 months has taught us is that healthcare and diagnostics are going to be extremely critical from an overall lifestyle perspective. We all may get a little more cautious in terms of how to approach the healthcare and the kind of precautions that we need to take to see that we are a little better prepared to deal with any eventuality that would lead to much higher revenue for both healthcare companies as well as diagnostic companies.
 
We will see a big traction there. In terms of allocation, we think names like Apollo are going to be important because this is one stock which has done very well even with Covid and without Covid. The way they have expanded I think it is going to be a big beneficiary. Diagnostic is an area where one could see a lot of allocation because of the way things are. One should have a decent amount of allocation for these two sectors in the portfolio.
 

Why did you tweet about Ipca Labs today morning?Ipca numbers were not great and the stock has been a laggard for about two quarters. In healthcare and some of these companies where the overall growth is going to be slightly muted, the performance may not be that great. It is a good stock for somebody who wants to play the export and the API part but the overall growth triggers or the excitement factor would be missing in the near term.
 
 One should focus on Sun Pharma or Divi’s where the overall growth visibility is much better or even Gland Pharma where the stock has corrected from Rs 4,000 to Rs 3,500, but the growth visibility and the triggers are much better."
Short-covering ahead of Q3 results lifts Maruti,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/short-covering-ahead-of-q3-results-lifts-maruti/articleshow/5483785.cms,m.economictimes.com,Short-covering ahead of Q3 results lifts Maruti,"Shares of Maruti Suzuki rose nearly 3 per cent on Wednesday to close at Rs 1,456.95, backed by good volumes. The stock has been among the laggards in the large-cap segment over the past couple of segments. This, in spite of the fact that some of the company's recently launched models, has evoked a very good response. Dealers tracking the counter say that Maruti's operating margins could be under pressure for some time, considering that its rivals happen to be some of the biggest names in the global arena. They attributed the rise in the stock to shortcovering of positions by ahead of the company's third quarter results due next week."

  The uncertainty around UP and other state elections has dominated investor attention of late -- so with the event outcome now imminent on this very day, the markets can be expected to be volatile, in the least. 
  
  However, from an overall trend perspective, both Nifty and Bank Nifty indices remain in an upward trend. Barring any exceptionally adverse outcome, we think that downsides, if any, should be limited and be used as buying opportunities. 
  
  The recent surge in Nifty implied volatility along with a significant addition in put positions clearly suggests that market participants have already taken ample protective measures. 
  
  It further indicates that there is low probability of sharp downside reactions. 
  
  We, thus, remain positive on Nifty, Bank Nifty in the medium term. From a stock-specific perspective we like Tata Motors and Voltas on the long side. 
  
  However, on the flip side we think FMCG stocks, especially Hindustan Unilever, look vulnerable to downside move. A break below 378 in the stock has the potential to shave off another 10% and, hence, should be used to create short positions.

  Stepping into the week because now we are going talk about earnings, what is it that you will be focussing on? 
  
  In general what we are going to see is growth coming in from most of the spaces, particularly you are going to see some of the heavyweights coming out with better numbers. We are going to see numbers coming good from Reliance side. 
  
  Also some of the banking stocks, private sector banks particularly where they did not have to do some provisioning kind of thing in the balance sheets. So they should be coming out with better numbers. IT companies we are expecting in general about between 15% and 20% growth reported in the bottom line. So auto companies for sure would definitely demand good amount of attention. 
  
  For a rally that they have seen in the volume, they should get reflected into the bottom line performance of this company. So overall, one can easily expect that the first quarter earning estimates would probably lead to somewhere around 25% growth in the financial year 2010-2011 and that should provide a much larger comfort to the investors to look at the Indian market. 
  
  Because if that being the situation and we are trading at around 16.5 times on a forward 9-month earning estimate basis for this financial year which would be sufficient enough for somebody to look at this market very positively. So I am reasonably confident that yes, overall, the macro aspects if they are coming under control in particular European economy related, my reading says that emerging markets like India would definitely demand better attention and we should be seeing further upside continuing in our market. 
  
  Though it would be very stock specific direction but it will be certainly there in our markets. So reasonably, we are remaining confident in that aspect."
Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/macros-suddenly-turning-supportive-for-markets-ajay-bodke/articleshow/38466461.cms,m.economictimes.com,Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,"In a chat with ET Now, Ajay Bodke, Head-Investment Strategist & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher, shares his views on the markets.
 
 
ET Now: Just when it appeared that Indian markets were looking slightly rusty, last 60 minutes yesterday made all the difference. What did the trick for us?
 
 
Ajay Bodke: What clearly is evident is that the macro variables are suddenly turning supportive for India. We saw some of the key data variables coming over the last few weeks. Be it the IIP number for May at 4.7 per cent where after nearly 15 quarters, the consumer durable numbers have done positive at 3.2 per cent. Followed by a four-month low WPI number that came in last week and a CPI number which presently surprised the market at 7.3 per cent which is the lowest since the new series has been started being computed from January 2012. So these are the issues that have been taken positively by the market.
 
 Also globally the crude prices, coal prices, iron and steel prices are clearly showing to be under control. Let us not forget that 75 per cent of India’s trade deficit is the oil and 12 per cent of India’s trade deficit is coal. So you are essentially looking at a substantial chunk of a trade deficit and the commodities contributing them on a downward trend. That is bringing cheer back to the market in addition to the budget which in view of the very tight fiscal space available to the Finance Minister has presented an admirable budget.
 
 Especially with drought looming in the wheat bowl as well as central parts of India as well as only 7 regions out of 36 sub-metro divisions getting excess rainfall and the rest of either having scanty or deficit rainfall. So we have to keep a very close watch on a weekly basis about the sowing data and on the progress of the monsoons. But overall, we are in my opinion over the hump and the market should consolidate at the current level."

ET Now: What are your closing comments? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: For me, this is a market which remains in an uptrend but now very close to important supply points. Typically, a good way to trade this kind of situation would be to tighten your stop losses. In case, the market fails to give a breakout, we might see it get back into this broad 180-200 point range with the 6180-6160 as support and 6320-6350 as the upper end of the range.
 
 In case there is a good breakout happening, then we might want to look at higher levels and if the Nifty manages to get pass 6350-6360 on a closing basis, good chance that we will head towards 6480-6500 sometime during the March expiry. So the bias is positive but given the fact that we are very close to historical levels, tactically we are trading with shorter stop losses. Individual stock I am still positive, the Nifty midcap index has given a strong buy signal and maybe the breadth might do better than the broader index."

Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/long-term-bonds-appear-to-be-the-magic-wand/articleshow/38833689.cms,m.economictimes.com,Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan last week performed a sex reassignment surgery on the Indian banking sector. He permitted banks to raise funds selling long-term bonds to build infrastructure. The logic was that building infrastructure is time-consuming, so it needed to be funded by long-term funds instead of short-term deposits, the mainstay of banks.


	Just a few months ago, RBI bought the argument of IDFC, an institution created exclusively to fund infrastructure projects, that its survival will be under threat if it keeps borrowing long-term through bonds. It granted a licence to IDFC to turn itself into a bank so that it can take deposits. The logic was it makes eminent sense to take deposits and lend rather than through bonds for 10 years. That could be done only if IDFC changes its gender, the wish that Rajan granted.


	How is it that in a matter of few months the regulator buys two different arguments, and grants opposite wishes? Is the regulator framing policies for industry, or individual cases determine what the policy is?


	The irony is that this is not the first time that the Indian financial sector is undergoing gender reassignment, but the second time in less than two decades. In the 1990s, development financial institutions led by ICICI converted into banks with a ‘convert or perish’ campaign espoused by its then chief K V Kamath. ICICI Bank succeeded, IDBI Bank managed to remain afloat following it. But the one that chose to retain the financial institution character, IFCI, is nearly irrelevant.


	If borrowing long term and lending was a wrong business model then for ICICI and now for IDFC, how is it that it’s good for banks? Are we making the entire banking system into development financial institutions?


	It was not the dearth of funds, but the composition of funding and lending that landed the Indian banking industry in a soup. Years of lending short-term bank funds to long-term projects, throwing the basics of asset-liability management to the winds, made banks shaky. When the interest rate cycle turned higher and the economy slowed, all the sins of the bull market came back to haunt. There is nothing to show that it will be different in the next cycle.


	Keeping in mind the ICICI and IDFC experience, it would have been wiser to ask: why did banks lend long-term instead of permitting them to sell long-term bonds? It also doesn't help in the efficient development of bond markets. Why should banks compete with its own customers in the same market for funds?


	 

	If banks are smart, they should not sell bonds, or stop just with token bond issues. If they go all out as if there is no tomorrow, they may well be sowing the seeds of the next banking crisis. The current one is because their funds are short term and lending is long term. The next one will be the flip side of it – longer term funds and short-term assets.


	There is near-unanimity that Indian interest rate cycle is at its peak now, and the only direction for rates is to head south. It is the outcome for which Rajan is working so hard. So, goading banks to borrow long term at current interest rates is something similar to what US Federal Reserve former chairman Alan Greenspan did to mortgage borrowers. Greenspan advised individual borrowers to shift to floating rates. That turned out to be the worst financial advice that anyone could give. It left millions homeless.


	Given the Indian financial tradition and the smartness of borrowers, the dice will be loaded against banks in the case of long-term bonds.


	At current interest rates, banks may be borrowing at near 10% without a call or put option. But they may be lending to someone who may have the choice of refinancing the loan at a lower rate when interest rates ease. Not many borrowers will accept covenants that prevent such a switch. So, the liability of banks will be for longer term, and assets could be of a shorter duration.


	Apart from Indian banking coming a full circle, it also raises the question of which is the right model. The truth is there is no formula for good profits all the time. It’s the quest for profitability that drives managements to compromise on prudence and overdo anything that delivers profits.


	This is the beginning of the next boom for the Indian economy. For the banking industry, long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand that will bring them out of the current mess and set them on the path to eternal profitability.


	What may begin as a trickle may quickly gather pace. The test will be how many guard against getting carried away. If there are excesses, then the system may end up being a eunuch once again looking for a gender change."

The stock has gained 9% in the past one month against a flat Sensex. The stock made its 52-week high of Rs 275 on January 4. KKCL’s performance on bourses has been outstanding. For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 37%, and it has doubled in six months. The stock gave an annual return of 113% beating the Sensex as well the ET Retail Index that rose 86% and 80% during the period, respectively. KKCL, which clocked revenues of Rs 159.4 crore in the past four quarters, manufactures jeans, semi-formals and casual wear under the brands Killer, Integriti, Lawman and Easies. Killer is the flagship brand that commands the highest margin for KKCL. Around 3-4% of KKCL’s sales are from exports to Asia, Middle East and the US. The company has doubled its net profit in the first half of FY10 against that reported in the same period a year ago. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters and will continue to do so in the future due to economies of scale on account of increased production capacity. Besides volume, average realisation has also gone up. The company sells products on a consignment basis, thus transferring the risk to its franchisee. \This asset-light strategy, coupled with integration and low-working capital requirements enables the company to enjoy higher returns on equity and on capital employed. In FY09, the company cleared a lot of its pending stock and has maintained low inventory levels since then, which will help in maintaining margins. The company reported net sales of Rs 57 crore in the September 2009 quarter, up 19% from the corresponding period a year ago. Operating profit at Rs 16.3 crore and a net profit at 11.5 crore were the highest since the time the company got listed in 2006. It has improved its debt to equity ratio from 0.17x on March 2009 to 0.10x as on September 2009. It also has surplus cash of Rs 105 crore, which leaves enough scope for further expansion. At Rs 267 and an annualised EPS of Rs 28.8 for FY10, the stock is valued at 9.3x its earnings, which makes it a good buy at this point of time. Going ahead, it could be a good turnaround stock for one’s portfolio."

ET Now: What is call now on Jet Airways? 

 
Jagdish Malkani: There is no denying that the fundamentals are still bleak, but there is tremendous value in this. It is very sad that it has got caught up in this whole controversy after controversy and that is really afflicted the stock. It has got a partner with deep pockets Etihad Airways. Etihad itself came out with dramatic results recently. It is on the prowl and globally picking up stakes. 

 With the sector rotation going on, it will be airline stocks all the way that probably applies equally to SpiceJet and all. There is tremendous value in this. 

 Another blow was the downgrade of the airport by the airport authority. If there is a review of that, it could give boost to the sector because that affected its US relationships and plans. Going forward, there is very little downside even if all hell break loose on the FDI deal.

Maintain overweight stance on IT sector: Gautam Chhaochharia,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/maintain-overweight-stance-on-it-sector-gautam-chhaochharia/articleshow/32776348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Maintain overweight stance on IT sector: Gautam Chhaochharia,"In a chat with ET Now, Gautam Chhaochharia, Head-India Research, UBS, shares his views on the rupee and it will affect the IT sector. 

 
ET Now: Do you think the rupee adjustment in large cap IT stocks is not fully captured or could IT stocks see some more downside given the way how the rupee has appreciated? 

 
Gautam Chhaochharia: We still maintain our overweight stance on IT services sectors. What we have seen till now is more of a sector rotation rather than reflecting the rupee appreciation and on the other hand we would also like to point out or argue that the levels of rupee at 62-63 was not really factored into most of the street earnings estimates because it was just for a short period of time. 

 So in that context, I do not think the rupee will move either from Rs 60 to Rs 63 levels or the move back has played a big role. It has been more a sector rotation trade which has happened specifically given EM flows globally. So investors have been forced to do more sector rotation rather than add significant positions on India. 

 The second point to highlight from our perspective, where we still maintain our overweight position on IT, is that for us IT is not just about a currency play. So that is one small short-term tactical issue, but the two bigger drivers for was, one, this recovery being seen in the US and Europe, which continues. 

 Secondly, the building blocks for more medium-term growth visibility for this sector is now emerging in the form of infrastructure and BPO sectors which have achieved scale and which can provide growth visibility not just for next one-two years, but for the longer term which is critical for valuations to sustain or even rerate from the current levels."

 Operating margin will be under pressure due to onsite wage hikes and a limited support from the currency movements. In addition, the revenue guidance for FY14 will likely be far more optimistic than the prior year considering the momentum in winning new accounts, believe analysts.
 
 Infosys, the second largest IT exporter among those listed on Indian bourses will declare its quarterly and annual financial performance on Friday, April 12, 2013.
 
 According to the average estimates of the forecasts by eight brokerages and estimates of ET Intelligence Group, Infosys is expected to report 3% increase in revenue in the March 2013 quarter from the previous quarter. Net profit, however, will fall by 3% sequentially reflecting analysts’ expectation of pressure on profitability.
 
 The consolidation of Lodestone’s business is likely to add 1-2% in the dollar terms to Infosys’s topline for the quarter, which means the core business growth will likely be muted at around 2% compared with the previous quarter’s 6% sequential jump. Volume growth is expected to be over 1.5%, lower than 2% in the previous quarter.
 
 The company increased onsite salaries by 2-3%, which will impact the operating profitability marginally for the March quarter.
 
 Investors will await to see whether the company continues to provide annual performance guidance given rising uncertainty in the global demand scenario. Analysts expect 9-12% revenue growth guidance from Infosys for FY14. This is higher than the anticipated 6% increase in the FY13 revenue."

 The ratio of corporate to retail loans stood at 57:43 compared with 51:49 a year ago. The bank said it plans to expand retail lending in the current fiscal as it sees good demand for vehicle financing in the coming quarters on the back of economic optimism.
 
 “In commercial vehicle segment, there is definitely demand picking up. Mining bans are being lifted in some states,” Sobti said, adding that all vehicle loans will have good demand. Demand for two-wheeler loans was significantly higher in the vehicle loans segment.
 
 The lender’s net bad loans or non-performing asset ratio stood at 0.33% versus 0.21% in the year-ago quarter.
 
 The bank has provided Rs 20 crore for corporate clients having un-hedged exposures as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India a few months ago. However, the bank has provided double the amount it actually required.
 
 According to Sobti, the profit level would have been higher without this provision. There could be a possibility of write-back of this provision if all banks decide to pass on the cost to their borrowing companies.

Indian companies’ return on equity (RoE) — a measure of a firm’s efficiency at maximising profits for shareholders — which in 2013-14 hit the lowest level in a decade, is expected to pick up in the current financial year driven by possible decline in interest rates, margin recovery and improved asset turnover ratio, said HSBC.  	RoE is expected to increase from 15% in 2013-14 to 16.5% by 2015-16. Indian companies’ RoE hit a peak of 22% in 2005. Although RoE has fallen in all major markets over the past few years on weaker global growth, RoE contraction in India has been among the most severe.  	“Although we do not expect RoE to return to the highs of 2005-08 anytime soon, we believe it has bottomed and expect profitability to improve,” said Jitendra Sriram, equity strategist and head of research, HSBC in a note. “We forecast RoE to rise 150 bps by FY16 and 200 bps by FY17 from the current level of 15%,” he said.  	HSBC expects materials and industrials to contribute significantly to the expected increase in India’s overall RoE  	HSBC said companies’ ROE compression was triggered by factors such as the decline in corporate profitability, increases in interest rates and a rising component of overseas revenues. The cost of doing business in India has gone up sharply due to factors such as an increase in the cost of inputs, difficulty in acquiring land and tougher environmental regulation, said the note.  	RBI hiked rates 13 times between March 2010 and October 2011 as it attempted to curb inflationary pressures. HSBC research shows the main drag on India’s overall RoE has clearly come from domestic cyclical sectors. The industrial sector’s RoE plunged from 34% in March 2005 to an all-time low of 11% in the last fiscal year ending March 2014."

ET Now: What is your call on IDFC? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: IDFC may have bounce backs but I do not think it will be sustainable. 105 now is a fairly strong resistance. Broadly it should head lower towards levels of about 75-76. A lot of these stocks are now getting to the 20% gap that we had for election. 

 So, once they start filling that gap, there is literally nothing for the next 15-20% on most of these stocks. That is something that people should keep in mind that more falls from here means that everything settles at least 15-20% lower."

"Hind Sanitaryware not so fragile now, improving fortunes",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hind-sanitarywares-not-so-fragile-now-improving-fortunes/articleshow/32758061.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Hind Sanitaryware's not so fragile now, improving fortunes","MUMBAI: With a growing number of consumers shifting to branded products, India’s largest sanitary ware company Hindustan Sanitaryware Industries (HSIL) is poised to benefit the most from the double-digit growth of the organised sanitary ware industry.
 
 Its glass-packaging business is also set for a turnaround, which would lead to non-linear earnings growth in the next two years. “We will grow at least 20% for the next two years in the bathroom products business. We are the price setters and we have been consistently outpacing the industry,” Sandip Somany, managing director of HSIL, told ET. “In our glass business, the losses are declining and we expect the business to become profitable at operating levels in the first half of 2014-15.”
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Though HSIL’s stock has gained 30% in the past month, it still continues to be under-valued if the two businesses — sanitary ware and glass — are to be valued independently. In the first nine months of the current fiscal, the operating profit (EBIT) of HSIL’s bathroom products grew 24%. Its profit after tax for the trailing 12 months is around Rs110 crore.
 
 Its peers — Cera and Kajaria — are trading at earnings multiples of 24 and 22, respectively. Giving HSIL a conservative multiple of 20, its building product business should be valued at Rs2,000 crore. But the company’s market capitalisation is only Rs830 crore. This is despite the company’s strong growth and margins compared with its peers. (see table) The reason for this is the glasspackaging business, which after being a drag for the last two years, is now on the road to recovery. HSIL has increased prices of the glass container business after almost two years.
 
 After growing at 27% CAGR from FY08-FY12, HSIL’s glass business started slowing down due to over capacity in the industry and the overall slowdown, especially consumption of beverages, beer and liquor. But the consumption is likely to pick up. Liquor and beer companies make up 60% of the business’ clients. Stocks of companies such as United Spirits and United Breweries are some of the most expensive stocks listed (P/E of more than 100) as the Street expects the consumption to pick up. HSIL offers a good proxy play at much lower valuations.
 
 “Industry discipline in terms of few furnace shutdowns seen last year should help improve demand-supply fundamentals. Various cost-control measures should yield operating leverage for HSIL as growth revives,” said Saurabh Kumar, analysts with JP Morgan in a recent report. With its strong presence in the high-growth sanitary business and potential turnaround in the glass business, the stock is due for a re-rating. In the past, consumer discretionary companies such as TTK Prestige, Asian Paints and Hawkins that enjoyed similar market positions in their respective industries, have become multi-baggers."
PE entry to help Himadri fund expansion,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pe-entry-to-help-himadri-fund-expansion/articleshow/5408138.cms,m.economictimes.com,PE entry to help Himadri fund expansion,"MUMBAI: Private equity Bain Capital has bought a 15.4% stake in Kolkata-based Himadri Chemicals in a move which will support the chemical company’s plan to triple capacity.The Rs 600-crore deal that includes an open offer to Himadri’s retail shareholders, will part-finance the company’s Rs 1,600-crore expansion plan that will raise its coal tar capacity to 400,000 tonne and forward integrate into other products for use in construction and auto industries, CEO Anurag Choudhary told ET.Coal tar is a high viscous liquid by-product derived from coal gas, and is widely used by the auto sector, specially by electric cars that are powered by lithium ion batteries. It is also used with readymix concrete to reduce usage of cement in construction. Bain Capital Private Equity had large chemicals businesses in its portfolio in the past, including firms such as Rhodia, paints maker SigmaKalon and Germany’s Trespaphan.Bain Capital private equity India head Amit Chandra could be nominated on the board of Himadri, although a final decision on the issue would be made after the completion of the open offer, which would likely raise Bain’s shareholding to a maximum of 35%, said a person connected with the development. According to Anurag Choudhary, Bain’s association is also to enable his company go global. “We had bid for Germany’s Rutgers in 2007, but withdrew due to high valuations. Now we might revisit our global plans,” he added.The company plans to set up a plant in China’s Shandong province in partnership with a local firm. The Choudharys will own 97% in that Chinese venture. “We want to have a total capacity of 1 mt in 3 years that will make us the top three producer globally,” he added. The focus of the PE deal with Himani, one of the few initiated in 2009, is also the emphasis on domain expertise, a pre-condition that most limited partners in PE funds have been insisting on after valuations plunged post the liquidity crisis. Large investors in a PE firm are referred to as limited partners. They provide capital to be invested in selected assets for returns after, typically, three to five years.A recent survey of major PE limited partners by KPMG, found many of them sought stronger operating skills as the downturn progressed into 2009 and as the falling tide exposed the internal problems of portfolio firms. “As LPs will make clear through their choice of fund managers, it is this factor more than any other that will likely separate the successful PE firm from its peers over the next few years,” said the survey."

HDFC third quarter net rises 12%,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/hdfc-third-quarter-net-rises-12/articleshow/29225501.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,HDFC third quarter net rises 12%,"MUMBAI: Housing Finance Development Corp on Wednesday met expectations with a 12 per cent increase in the third-quarter net profit, as demand for loans from individual home buyers remained healthy despite a slowdown in the economy. Net profit for the October-December period rose to Rs 1,278 crore from Rs 1,140 crore a year earlier, the country’s oldest mortgage lender said.
 
 Net interest margin, or the difference between funding costs and interest earned on loans, was nearly flat at 4 per cent compared with 4.06 per cent a year earlier. Net interest income, which is comparable with revenue for companies in other sectors, rose nearly 16 per cent to Rs 1,829 crore.
 
 While demand for funds has slowed in a weak economy, the housing finance sector has remained somewhat insulated. Individual home buyers, who are driving this demand, have also been repaying their loans regularly, helping lenders offset slippages in other loan categories.
 
 For instance, at HDFC, bad loans in the retail portfolio fell to 0.57 per cent in the December quarter from 0.62 per cent a year earlier. This helped limit its overall non-performing assets – which rose to 0.77 per cent of total loans from 0.75 per cent – despite NPA in the non-individual segment almost doubling to 1.81 per cent.
 
 Vice-chairman Keki Mistry said the lender will focus more on growing its individual loan book. “We expect the loan book to grow in the range of 18-20 per cent,” he said. Mistry predicted its cost of funds to remain flat because “ interest rates are expected to remain stable”.
 
 HDFC’s total outstanding loans grew 19.5 per cent to more thanRs 1.92 lakh crore at the end of December. “Most of the housing finance companies, including HDFC and LIC Housing Finance, have seen growth in loan portfolio,” said Kajal Gandhi, a banking analyst at ICICI Securities.
 
 
 
“We have a positive outlook on the sector.” But competition is intensifying, with banks aggressively targeting the home buyer at a time when demand for funds from other segments of the economy is low. “HDFC has managed to maintain its net interest margin because of its sheer size and good liability management,” said Gandhi.
 
 Rikesh Parikh, vice-president of institutional corporate broking at Motilal Oswal Securities, said HDFC’s plan to focus on smaller cities to boost growth in a slowing economy is a positive sign.
 
 According to him, HDFC’s asset quality has remained healthy over the past several quarters and the trend is likely to continue. The lender’s capital adequacy ratio for the quarter ended December was 19.1 per cent compared with 17.5 per cent a year earlier."

Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/four-wheelers-propel-growth-for-greaves-cotton/articleshow/32816242.cms,m.economictimes.com,Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,"For Greaves Cotton, sliding sales volumes of three-wheelers since the quarter to March FY12 was a major worry, since it was a major supplier of engines to three-wheelers. Three-wheeler sales volumes were severely impacted as freight operators moved to lower horse power, or HP, four-wheeler vehicles such as Tata Motors Ace and M&M Gio, which are classified as small commercial vehicles, or SCVs. 

 The Greaves Cotton management then decided to shift focus from the three-wheeler companies to the SCV segment, hoping this would deliver revenue growth higher than its core business catering to three-wheelers. Through the “hub & spoke” model, which involves transporting goods through highways by heavy vehicles and then using small vehicles for city roads, the company supplied SCV engines to Tata Motors for Ace Zip and the Magic Iris model. 

 The company’s SCV engine volumes now account for 14 per cent of its total engine volumes, compared with a negligible contribution three years ago. Says Sunil Pahilajani, MD & CEO, Greaves Cotton, “Our focus has changed to auto original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) side, from being a threewheeler supplier to a complete solution provider to the SCV segment. In trying times, our focus has been on adding to the product range, adding more customers and to enter various categories.” 

 After Pahilajani took charge of the company two years ago, he ensured there was a CEO for each segment and spun off the after-sales segment as a separate division. Revenue from the after-sales segment now accounts for 15% of the company’s total revenue and it enjoys a high margin compared to the other segments. Given the economic slowdown, which impacted volumes of power gensets and the industrial engines segment, the company targeted augmenting revenues from the after-sales segment and to increase its exports. 

 “We are able to maintain revenue growth from the after-sales segment, when industry players have seen a significant dip in revenues from this vertical. Revenue from after-sales has partially offset pressures emanating from other verticals,” said Pahilajani. He said the company is planning to increase revenue contribution from the export market to 10% in the next three years from 3% now. The company’s plant now works at 70 per cent capacity utilisation. 

 In the next few quarters, Greaves Cotton’s farm equipment segment is expected to do well and its contribution to the company’s total revenues is expected to rise as the company is making inroads into the electric pump-set market, which has a market size of.`3,000 crore. Besides, the company has a 50% market share in the petrol and kerosene market and has 1,000 retail touch points in India. It also plans to grab market share in the highly fragmented electric pump market. 

 But what could be a big threat to the company in the next few quarters is the possibility of revenue growth being affected if auto companies start manufacturing engines themselves. Besides, a heavy monsoon, drought or floods can also impact its revenue growth. More importantly, the company’s revenue growth is linked to the revival of the road sector, which has been struggling owing to a fall in traffic, high interest rates and policy paralysis. 

 According to Bloomberg data, the company’s revenues and profits are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% and 23 per cent, respectively, in the FY09-15 period.

Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/greaves-cotton-set-to-flourish-with-improving-margins/articleshow/48721599.cms,m.economictimes.com,Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,"Greaves Cotton saw a 10% fall in revenue year on year (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2015-16. The exit from the infrastructure equipment business is the main reason behind this fall in revenue. Delayed recovery in four-wheeler small commercial vehicle segment and a sluggish growth in farm equipment segment, due to slow release of subsidies and small increase in minimum support price, have also contributed to this revenue contraction. But, despite the fall in revenue, the company has impressed the market because of a robust growth in profit.
 
 
Improvement in margins helped the company report an adjusted net profit growth of 22% y-o-y. The reported net profit growth is up 51% y-o-y. The net profit this time also contains a one-time profit related to the sale of properties. The 527 basis points margin improvement, y-o-y, in the first quarter, is largely attributable to Cotton Greaves’s exit from the infrastructure equipment business, which was making continuous losses at the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level. Improved operational efficiencies, such as reduction in material and employee costs, further contributed to better margins.
 
 Though Greaves Cotton is into the manufacturing of engines that work on almost all fossil fuels—petrol, diesel, kerosene—and can used in automobiles—threewheelers, four-wheeler small commercial vehicles—fishing boats, agri pumps, etc., most of its revenue comes from the automobile segment. Greaves Cotton, with a market share of 85%, is the biggest player in the three-wheeler auto segment.
 
 To augment its auto engine business further, the company has developed engines that can be fitted on vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tonne, a major jump from the previous level of 0.8 tonne. The company should see a significant improvement in its four-wheeler engine market share, currently at 14%, in the coming years. In July, the company signed a deal with Eicher-Polaris for its 600 cc four-wheeler vehicle, Multix, and is trying to get one more four-wheeler company on board during this financial year. Besides new tie-ups, a ramp up in volumes from existing partners is also possible, given the increase in the company’s engine offerings.
 
 
The future looks extremely bright for Greaves Cotton and as per the consensus analysts’ estimate, its net profit is expected to zoom to Rs 211 crore in 2016-17, an annualised 59% gain compared to 2014-15. This fast-growing company’s stock is quoting at reasonable valuations and, therefore, investors can buy it for long-term investment.
 
 Selection Methodology: We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in ‘consensus analyst rating’ in the past one month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search is restricted to stocks that are covered by at least 10 analysts.

 At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in far-month June rose by Rs 101, or 0.36 per cent to Rs 28,490 per ten gram in business turnover of 52 lots. 

 Similarly, the yellow metal for delivery in April gained Rs 80, or 0.28 per cent to Rs 28,795 per ten gram in 1960 lots. 

 Analysts attributed the rise in gold prices at futures trade to a firming trend in the overseas markets on speculation that the US economic recovery may be stalling, boosted demand for the precious metal.

Though jewellery sales gathered momentum, the metal lost its lustre among investors as a lucrative instrument to park funds. Bullion dealers said there has been panic selling as news spread that gold has entered a bearish mode. 

 Rajiv Popley, director of Mumbai-based Popley & Sons, said: “Demand has surged at least by 15-20% in the past two days. Buyers are placing orders for Akshay Tritiya which is on May 13. We also had a good Gudi Padwa, which marks the beginning of the new year according to the Hindu calendar.” 

 What is enthusing the jewellers is that consumers are buying jewellery for own use and not for weddings and festivals. “This is a good sign for jewellers. We are seeing that demand has drifted from diamond-studded jewellery to pure gold jewellery. The ratio of gold jewelley to gold investment products is now 65:35. But at this level investment demand is likely to fall by 50%,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director, Nemichand Bamalwa, and past chairman of All India Gem and Jewellery Trade Federation. 

 In 2012, jewellery demand in India slipped to 552 tonne from 618.3 tonne in 2011 largely due to rising prices. 

 The import price rose because the rupee weakened against the dollar, pushing up the landed cost of the metal. Investment demand in 2012 was at 312.2 tonne, which slipped from 368 tonne in 2011, according to World Gold Council data. 

 Bullion dealers say jewellers are not entering the market though the price has fallen as they would like to liquidate the inventories first. “There is hardly any buying from jewellers as there is a feeling that prices will come down to Rs 24,200 per 10 gm. Silver is expected to fall to Rs 39,000 per 1 kg,” said Suresh Hundia, director, Hundia Exports, a leading Mumbai -based bullion dealer. 

 In Bangalore, demand for jewellery has surged by 30% in the past two days. Venkatesh Babu, owner of Bangalore-based Chetna Jewellers & Bullion, said: “Footfall has increased and consumers are buying gold for their own use. However, investors are staying away at the moment and they are waiting for the price to stabilise.” 

 Analysts say gold may bounce back to Rs 26, 000 in the near term. Kishore Narne, associate director & head, Commodity & Currency, Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker, said the plunge in gold prices seems to be ending as it has broken all near-term supports and had a free fall over the last two trading sessions. 

 “The next big support for gold exists at $1,310 and we expect that support to hold for the near term,” he said.“A pullback towards $1,400 an ounce looks possible and holding above that can extend it towards $1,440. The crash in gold prices is close to the near term bottom and will start to see pullback and consolidation. 

 Gold will take support between Rs 25,200-25,100 and can bounce from there towards Rs 25,800-26,000. Sustaining below Rs 25,000 can push the prices towards Rs 24,500-24,200 in the coming days. 

 Silver has given up all gains over the last 2 years and will continue to trade weak. Pullbacks look due and can extend towards Rs 45,000-45,500 per kg,” he added."

The global economic crisis and the resultant volatility have led to the need for diversification of portfolios and increased the importance of risk management. It’s during such times that gold’s fundamental characteristics stand out as a hedge against inflation and preserver of wealth.

Besides, there is a continued erosion of purchasing power of the world’s key currencies, rising inflation and, of late, the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. Little wonder then that the metal has risen since 2002.

According to the World Gold Council's (WGC) latest report, the global demand in the second quarter of 2012-13 stood at 990 tonne, down 7% on a year-on-year basis due to the weak demand in jewellery, investment and technology. The net buying trend by banks, which started in the second quarter of 2009, continued in this quarter as well. The demand by central banks and official institutions in the developing countries increased 63% to 157.5 tonne. Gold's cultural heartland, India and China, continued to dominate the consumer demand segment, contributing 45% to the total jewellery, bar and coin demand.

The consumer demand for gold in China for the second quarter of 2012 was 145 tonne, down 7% y-o-y due to the economic slowdown and lack of a clear price trend. In the first quarter of 2012, the demand rose to a record 255.2 tonne, overtaking that of India. In India, the monetary tightening, rapid depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, economic slowdown, stubborn inflation, high interest rates and fear of weak monsoons curtailed the gold demand as prices touched a record high of Rs 31,422 per 10 gm.

The upward trend has continued since 2000 and gold has performed well compared with other asset classes, with a CAGR of 17% from 2000 through 2011 and a notable 22% during 2010 and 2011. Gold has posted a 13% year-to-date return, whereas the Sensex yielded 12% during this period.

India's gold imports rose to 969 tonne, amounting to $60 billion in 2011-12, pushing the current account deficit to a record $78.2 billion, 4.2% of the GDP, due to the rupee depreciation. This prompted the government to hike import duty on gold to 4% of the value in March 2012. Since then, gold imports have declined 37% to 131 tonne during April-June 2012, according to the WGC report. The consumer demand stood at 181.3 tonne for the second quarter of 2012, down 38% on a y-o-y basis. However, the assets under management of the 14 gold ETFs in India touched Rs 10,300 crore in May 2012, from Rs 5,463 crore a year ago. However, according to GFMS, the imports to India may fall 26% to 650-750 tonne in 2012.


				


Gold prices inched to an all-time high at just above $1,920 per ounce in September 2011 amid concerns about western economies. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has strengthened, adversely impacting the prices in global markets.

	 

doweshowbellyad = 0;

The yellow metal touched a low of $1,538 per ounce in May 2012 due to the sovereign debt crisis in the Euro-zone, and is currently trading at $1,690 per ounce. The prices have moved in a range with slight ups and downs. Presently, gold prices are tracking the global sentiment and moving in tandem with the riskier assets.


				


In August this year, after the US Federal Reserve Annual Symposium, and comments from the Fed chairman about the continuation of accommodative polices in the US, the metal surged to a five-month high of $1,693 per ounce.


				


The global demand is expected to strengthen in the future, triggered by the hope of monetary easing in the US, and positive outcome of the European Central Bank meeting on 6 September, which announced an unlimited bond buying program to fix Eurozone countries' borrowing costs. It could weaken the US dollar, increasing the investment in gold. On the domestic front, the demand will depend on the rupee depreciation and policy measures. The rain deficiency is likely to fall, driving gold demand in rural areas. It may also gain strength due to the festive/wedding season during October-December.

 The Mumbai-headquartered company had posted a net profit of Rs 208.58 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.
 
 The company, however, said its net profit for the quarter is not comparable due to out-licensing income of Rs 111.23 crore received in the corresponding quarter last year and also due to mark-to-market losses to the extent of Rs 55 crore recorded in the first quarter of 2012-13 fiscal, PTI reported.
 
 “However, the core net profit (excluding the out-licencing income and the forex loss/gain) jumped by 44.3 per cent YoY to Rs129.6 crore,” Sharekhan said in a report.
 
 At 01:14 pm, Glenmark Pharma was trading 5 per cent higher at Rs 406.95. It has hit a low of Rs 381.50 and a high of Rs 409.80 today.
 
 Rajat Rajgarhia, Director-Research, Motilal Oswal Securities, bets on Ipca Laboratories Ltd, Torrent Pharma and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd in the pharma sector, among his multi-bagger ideas.
 
 Both revenue and sales of the pharma major surged during the quarter. During the quarter, the company’s sales from the Indian formulation business stood at Rs 279.78 crore, up 24 per cent, as against Rs 225.38 crore registered in the first quarter of the 2011-12 fiscal.
 
 In Q1FY2013 the net sales of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Glenmark) grew by 19.8 per cent year on year (YoY) to Rs 1,040.4 crore.
 
 “The specialty business includes the Indian formulation business, which grew by 24.1 per cent YoY during the quarter. Though the growth rate is better than the industry growth rate of 15%, it falls short of our expectation,” Sharekhan reported.
 
 The brokerage firm maintains a ‘buy’ recommendation on the counter with a target price of Rs 468 for a 12-month timeframe.
 
 The company posted revenues of Rs 392.35 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2012, mainly driven by generic business. The revenues stood at Rs 251.15 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal.
 
 Avinnash Gorakssakar, Founder Director, Moneyinvestments.in is positive on the pharma sector. Cipla and Glenmark Pharma are among his top bets.
 
 Although for Glenmark the price has moved up a bit, but with the kind of decline in their upfront payment, one can definitely buy the stock for long-term, he added.
 
 Gaurang Shah, Assistant Vice President, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd, recommends investors to ‘buy’ Glenmark Pharma with a target price of Rs 445."

 Gillette India was called Indian Shaving Products when it launched operations in India in 1984; Procter & Gamble did not exit India then, but Richardson Hindustan Ltd, the owner of the Vicks brand did. 

 P&G snapped up Richardson’s parent in a global acquisition in 1985 and entered India, adding the famous Vicks brand to its portfolio. Twenty years later in 2005, history seemed to repeat itself when P&G bought Gillette worldwide, becoming the owner of male grooming products such as shaving razors and creams. 

 For some time now, investors have been speculating about a possible open offer and delisting of Gillette India. The firm’s shares have jumped 10% in the past four days on high volumes on buzz that such an offer is imminent. Two bankers have apparently been appointed to do the process.

The BPO firm, which counts Wachovia, Wells Fargo and GE as top clients, posted a 28% rise in net profit to $36 million for the first quarter ended March 31. Sales of $331 million for the quarter also beat street expectations. Analysts were expecting sales of $326 million.
  
  
  ""Revenues from business process management services continue to be our growth engine,"" said Pramod Bhasin, Genpact's President and CEO. Revenue growth from GE, Genpact's largest client, almost remained flat at 0.7% from the same period last year. GE contributes about 34% to Genpact's sales.
  
  
  Genpact counts BPO firms WNS and EXL Service as its competitors, which have been on the block. Genpact on the other hand is trying to integrate IT services into its portfolio, to up its sales growth stagnated by flattish contribution from its largest client GE. Genpact's sales had grown 12% last year compared to the Indian BPO industry's growth of about 15%. 
  
  
  IT companies in India, however, grew about 27% last year. The company bought Noida-based IT firm Headstrong for $550 million last month, whose sales will be accounted for in next few quarters. Genpact will gain clients like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley with the buyout.
  
  
  Current revenues from IT services for Genpact were about 13% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2011. About 87% of Genpact's revenues for the quarter came from business process management services, up from 85% for the first quarter of 2010.
  
  
  An improved market for outsourcing has also led to rise in attrition for BPOs. Genpact's employee attrition rate for the quarter was 29%, up from 23% for the same period in 2010. As of March 31, 2011, Genpact had about 45,500 employees worldwide, an increase from 41,300 as of March 31, 2010. The firm's revenue per employee increased from $29,900 in the first quarter of 2010 to $30,700 in the quarter ending March this year. The $76-billion Indian IT-BPO industry is projected to grow about 18% this year."
Acquisitions double GCPL's topline,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/acquisitions-double-gcpls-topline/articleshow/6751120.cms,m.economictimes.com,Acquisitions double GCPL’s topline,"The stock of Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) rose by 3% in a weak broader market on Thursday after news of the merger of its fully owned subsidiary Godrej Household Products (GHPL) with itself. GCPL has a strong position in north India and GHPL is strong in the southern region. 
  
  The integration will help the company achieve economies of scale with higher cost synergies, better product portfolio and a stronger distribution network. 
  
  Godrej Household Products was initially a joint venture between Godrej Consumer Products and the US-based Sara Lee and Body Care. Recently, GCPL bought the 51% stake of Sara Lee and formed GHPL. 
  
  GHPL earns a major part of its revenue from home insecticides such as Good Knight and Hit. In FY10, GHPL had a total revenue of Rs 950 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 150 crore. Since GCPL earlier had only 49% stake in GHPL, it contributed a little less than 25% of the profits. 
  
  Post merger, the home insecticide business would roughly have a 40% share. Hence, the merger will help GCPL to reduce its dependence on soap products and also tackle high raw material cost caused by inflation in the soap segment.
  
  The timing of the acquisition, which took place in May-end just before the monsoons, may improve the topline of GCPL in the September quarter. According to a Tata Securities report, there is a very high correlation between monsoons and the insecticide industry. 
  
  Godrej Consumer’s net sales have more than doubled due to a series of acquisitions in the past. The company mainly operates in the personal wash, hair products and insecticides segments and aspires to grow big in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
  
  The recent acquisitions of Indonesia-based Megasarai, Africa-based Tura, and Latin America-based Issue and Argencos confirm the company’s ambition. In the past 3 months, GCPL’s stock price has increased by only 7.5% as against the 14.5% increase in the broader market Sensex. 
  
  At the current market price of Rs 401, the stock is trading at a consolidated price-earnings ratio of 33.2."

ET Now: The management of GCPL has just talked about a further improvement in the domestic market share. Is that the only trick available now?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: GCPL is not focused entirely on the domestic market.
 
 The FMCG company is insulated from the volume de-growth concerns that we have with other top FMCG companies.
 
 The company has taken a considerable time to establish itself in new geographies — the African and the South East Asian markets.
 
 It is placed second or at top slot in most of the segments that it is into. That is where you get pricing power. In such a scenario, a company like GCPL does not have to promote itself.
 
 Hence, the advertising and promotions (A&P) expenses come down significantly. In other words, selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) for the company is quite low.
 
 That is exactly what a higher market share helps you with. The cost of retaining market share should be too primitively high, which some of the domestic companies are dealing with. GCPL is surely one of the relatively undervalued stocks.
 
 You can anytime compare it with stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Britannia. That is why this stock attracts a lot of interest.

GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gail-to-benefit-most-from-rasgas-price-tweak/articleshow/49899602.cms,m.economictimes.com,GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,"ET Intelligence Group: Stocks of gas distributing companies including GAIL, Petronet LNG, Gujarat Gas, Indraprastha Gas and GSPL have risen by 13 per cent on average in a week now that renegotiation of gas prices with RasGas, a Qatar-based gas company, is turning from hope to reality. GAIL shot up 25 per cent making it the world’s best performing utility stock previous week since the company is expected to be a major beneficiary of such a renegotiation.
 
 There are three major changes in the renewed contract with RasGas, according to news reports. First, gas prices have been linked to three month average price of crude oil compared with a period of 12 months earlier. In addition to this, cap and floor have been removed from the gas pricing methodology. This means gas price will fall by half to $6-7/mmbtu from current level. Second, RasGas will postpone the recovery of liability of $1.5 billion of lesser offtake of 2015 and liability burden will be recovered in the next 13 years of remaining contract. The third factor is that the proportion of crude oil to compute gas price — in technical parlance known as slope — has been changed.
 
 Among Indian companies, GAIL will benefit on two counts. One, more gas will flow from its pipelines, which will accrue more transmission revenues. Second, lower raw material price for petrochemical division. Analysts reckon that every $1/mmbtu fall in gas price will lift GAIL’s Earning per share (EPS) for the next year by Re 1. This means price fall of $5/mmbtu will add another Rs 560 crore profitability for the GAIL.
 
 

 
 Petronet LNG will benefit since there will be no liability of $1.5 billion emerging from take or pay (ToP) clause and gradually longterm volume will move to normal level thus, lifting the utilisation of the Dahej terminal.
 
 Apart from these, gas distributors such as IGL, Gujarat Gas could also gain on the RasGas contract as this gas constitutes 10-15 per cent of their gas mix and cater to their industrial customers. Pure transporters like GSPL, while not direct beneficiaries, as they were not meaningfully impacted in the first place, could be indirect longer-term gainers as any renegotiation is a tacit acknowledgement of the LNG market having structurally changed, which should benefit importing countries like India."

Subramaniam helped the company repay debt and FCCB, consolidated facilities, broke operational silos, realigned sales functions, renegotiated unviable client agreements, and rationalise cost.

""Few months after I rejoined, we realised the magnitude of breakdown in internal governance. A lot of things had collapsed and all our stake holders had lost confidence,"" recalls Subramaniam.

""We reassessed all the assets and systems and came out with a viable option to bring Firstsource back on track,"" he said. This included realigning the processes, rationalising employee structure and renegotiating with all the clients.

Twelve months down the line, Firstsource had a new life - and a new promoter: RPG Group's Sanjiv Goenka acquired Firstsource in 2012. There were others who were interested. Vedanta Group CFO Tarun Jain and Rakesh Jhunjunwala, known as India's Warren Buffett, put in money.

Using the cash from preference allotment to promoters and other internal accruals, the company was able to pay back $237 million, or Rs 1,300 crore, FCCB in 2012. Then the company undertook various restructuring exercises: it weeded out non-profitable customers - mostly Indian clients with low margins - and identified areas of growth, especially the healthcare industry in the US.

Under the new leadership, Firstsource's profit after tax more than doubled to Rs 146 crore in FY13 from Rs 62 crore a year ago, and the stock has more than trebled to Rs 24 at present from its low of Rs 8 in 2011. The debt has also halved to Rs 1,000 crore.

But the best is yet to come, according to the new chief. ""Last year we emerged, this year we will consolidate, and next year we will start growing,"" said Subramaniam.

	 
""In the current fiscal, the company is expecting a profit after tax of over Rs 180 crore. In the next fiscal, we will grow by at least 12-15%, our operating margins will also increase by another 200 basis points and our net debt will be less than $80 million, or Rs 500 crore,"" he said.

This seems feasible given the company's focus on healthcare and insurance sectors, which account for almost 35-40% of its revenues. ObamaCare, as it is popularly known, mandates that its citizens buy health insurance in 2014 or else face penalty. This could bring 30 million Americans into the insurance net, and implies incremental volumes for both hospitals and insurers. ""We are very excited about this and are expecting a growth of over 15% in our healthcare business process outsourcing,"" said Subramaniam.

Although the company's stock has run up by over 100% in the past year, it is still trading at an attractive valuation. It is trading at FY14 price-to-earnings multiple of 9 and FY15 P/E multiple of 6.5, which is quite cheap compared with other IT peers which are trading at multiples of over 10.

""FSL continues to be an attractive story for value investors given the debt repayment roadmap, which itself could translate into market-cap gains,"" said Abhishek Shindadkar, IT analyst with ICICI Direct. ""Going by the current rate, the company will end FY16 with a net cash of at least Rs 300 crore,"" he added."

Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/facebook-rally-has-analysts-gasping-for-breath/articleshow/31859756.cms,m.economictimes.com,Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,"By Sarah Frier
 
 SAN FRANCISCO: Wall Street analysts are racing to keep up with Facebook’s stock rally. Shares of the world’s biggest social network have jumped 32% so far this year, compared with a 1.6% gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The surge has left the 49 analysts who cover Facebook in a bind -- while 38 of them recommend the company with the equivalent of a buy rating, 21 of the total now have share-price targets below where Facebook is trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That translates into an average 12-month price target of $72.46 for Facebook, less than 1% above the company’s closing price of $72.03 on Monday. 

 With the stock advancing more rapidly than anticipated, the price targets -- many of which were calculated in 2014, with several dating back to last year - - would suggest that analysts on average see little upside to the stock. That may force some of the bulls to adjust their projections, with two analysts boosting their price forecasts on Monday. 

 “Facebook stock has just ripped past expectations,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG in New York, who in October recommended buying the shares with a $68 target over the next 12 months. At the time, Facebook was trading at $49. “We’re very happy with our rating upgrade to buy, but it has all happened super fast,” he said. 

 
FACEBOOK’S TURNABOUT 

 In Germantrading on Tuesday, the stock rose less than 1% to the equivalent of $72.52 at 10:58 a.m. in Frankfurt. Facebook’s stock surge underscores how the company’s prospects have improved following its rocky stock-market debut in May 2012. 

 Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg weathered a 50% drop in the company’s stock price in the months after its initial public offering at $38, as investors questioned whether Facebook could come up with a mobile strategy with users increasingly accessing the social network from smartphones and tablets. Since then, Facebook has pushedinto mobile advertising. In January, it reported quarterly results that beat estimates, with more than half of ad revenue coming from mobile devices. Last month, Facebook ramped up its mobile business by agreeing to purchase WhatsApp for as much as $19 billion in cash and stock, betting on the mobile-messaging startup’s large international user base to accelerate growth. 

 
UNANIMOUS ANALYSIS 

 While it isn’t unheard of for a company to trade above its average analyst price target Facebook stands out because of how analysts almost unanimously agree their clients should buy the stock."

 The stock rose 12.72 per cent to hit a high of Rs 4.43 on the BSE. 

 The steelmaker, in a regulatory filing to BSE, said that board members have “considered and taken on record SDR package approved by Joint Llenders’ Forum pursuant to RBI circular dated June 8 for conversion of part of debt aggregating to Rs 2,507 crore into 250.75 crore equity shares of the company of Rs. 10 each.” 

 According to the company's FY15 annual report, the company’s total debt was in excess of Rs 10,000 crore as of March 31, 2015. 

 In the September quarter results, the company had informed exchanges that due to continuous losses and excess of current liabilities over current assets, its net worth had fallen by around 50 per cent. 

 The company reported a net loss of Rs 624 crore for FY15. Net loss for the H1FY16 stood at Rs 389 crore. 

 Yet, the scrip has fallen 11.72 per cent so far this calendar, compared with a 35 per cent fall in the BSE metal index during the same period."

  This is strictly a short term trading recommendation because the stock’s long term trend is down. This is not a portfolio stock at all but it has got a built up a bit of momentum in the last two weeks or so and should the market hold out, this is a nice volatile stock which can deliver on the upside as well. This has been the prime reason for picking it. So if the stock is bought, do not look beyond week maximum for holding this stock.

Mayuresh Joshi: Their numbers are more or less in line with what the street was expecting. A couple of points that probably worked in favour of Dish was that the content costs were probably contained at around 90 to 100 odd crores and again looking at the kind of digitisation processes that are probably going through, though they have probably got extended for this fiscal, the take probably is that with MSOs probably hiking rates, players like Dish have some amount of leverage at least in terms of subscription additions and they have done a pretty good job. Whether that probably translates into ARPUs on an existing scale going forward and compounding as was the quarters go by, is something that time will decide. So our probable take is that if you are looking within this space, DTH, media, print media, we still prefer to go with the guys in the print media space."

 As per the deal details, India will set up an insurance pool led by General Insurance Co and four other insurance companies of a total amount of Rs 750 crore to indemnify companies that build reactors in the country against liabilities in case of a nuclear accident.
 
 The remaining Rs 750 crore of the total Rs 1,500 crore to offset liabilities will be provided by the government of India. This will address US concerns over clause 17 of the Indian liability Act.
 
 ""We are happy to know that an agreement has been announced between the Indian & US governments on the contentious issue of Civil Nuclear Liability. Although details would need to be studied, I feel confident that, given the strong emphasis placed by our government on ""Make in India"", the interests of all stakeholders, including domestic industries which have been steadfastly supporting India's own nuclear program, will be adequately addressed,” said MV Kotwal, Whole Time Director & President Heavy Engineering, Larsen & Toubro.
 
 The two countries will also kickstart joint production on four defense products that will be beneficial for Indian companies, say reports.
 
 According to Rajiv Memani, CEO, Ernst & Young, it is a breakthrough moment and a positive development.
 
 “Joint production of defence deals group promotes the theme of Made in India, speed up decision making process,” he told ET Now.
 
 It took six years for a breakthrough after a bilateral agreement was signed between the two countries.
 
 “We are moving towards commercial cooperation, consistent with our laws (and) international legal obligations,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the press conference.
 
 The Indian and the US companies are yet study finer details of the deal.

The company more than doubled its capacity of ammonium nitrate in FY14, and is expanding other businesses as well.
 
 In 2012, the government had introduced ammonium nitrate rules to regulate production, transportation and warehousing of this material, when it became apparent that some people were using it for harmful purposes. The regulations became applicable from January 2014, mandating KYC norms for customers as well as transporters, numbered bagging and GPS-enabled transportation, among other things.
 
 ""The new rules are expected to increase the cost of import since ammonium nitrate is required to be imported in bagged condition,"" said Shailesh Mehta, the company's chairman and managing director. It commissioned 300,000-tonne capacity in FY14 to take its total capacity to 470,000 tonne, when India's annual consumption of technical ammonium nitrate (TAN) stands at around 700,000 tonne, growing at 7-8%.
 
 

 
 The company recorded a 33% jump in its TAN volumes in the first nine months of FY14, which emerged as the single-largest revenue earner for the company at nearly 25% of total revenues.
 
 ""Our TAN capacity utilisation stands at around 60% at present, which will go up to 80-90% in FY15,"" said Somnath Patil, president and chief financial officer of the company.
 
 The company's other specialty chemical Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), a solvent used in pharma and paint industries, has also come up well contributing 20% to the company's total turnover. This unit is already working at 100% capacity utilisation at its 70,000-tonne plant.
 
 ""The IPA requirement in the domestic market is increasing by around 6-7% from the present level of 1,10,000 tonne. Therefore, another similar plant will be needed to serve domestic requirement. We are evaluating various options for increasing capacity,"" said Mehta.
 
 Thanks to these two chemicals, in addition to nitric acid and methanol, the company's industrial chemicals segment has emerged a faster growing business with better margins, compared with the fertiliser.
 
 The company is also investing in agri-inputs business. ""We are expanding fertiliser capacity at Taloja from the existing 2.29 lakh tonne to 6-lakh tonne. This will also allow us to produce different grades of complex fertilisers as well as fortified fertilisers,"" said Mehta.
 
 There are two main concerns ahead for the company. First, the likely increase in natural gas prices from April ’14 will need raising retail prices of the fertilisers it sells, which may hamper volume growth in the short term. Second, its real estate project — a specialty mall in Pune named Ishanya — is losing money. The company is working on its turnaround, but with little success so far.
 
 Notwithstanding these worries, the company’s FY15 numbers will be significantly better than the current year. This visibility on recovery and inexpensive valuations are making the company attractive to investors. Six out of eight brokerage houses tracking the company hold a ‘Buy’ recommendation, according to Bloomberg data.
 
 “Deepak is currently trading at 4.7 times its expected FY15 earnings, which is at a discount of 30% to its long-term average,” said a report from brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher. “Dividend yield of 5% prevents further downside risk,” it added. Investors will do well to stay with the company."

  ""We will introduce more products in Africa as we look to expand our presence in the overseas market,"" Duggal said, without specifying the kind of products it plans to launch in the region. 
  
  Dabur, which sells personal care and healthcare products under brands like Dabur and Vatika, had a sales of Rs 4,110 crore. Around 22 per cent of the company's sales come from international operations. 
  
  ""In the current year we expect 28 per cent of sales coming from the overseas as the benefit of our recent acquisitions will start kicking in,"" Duggal said.

 There was a time when anything which had software in its name did very well 1999-2000 and then in 2003-2004 where anything which had infrastructure in its name did extremely well - whether or not they had something to do with infrastructure. 

 “This is the age of Bharat and everything that appears to have Bharat in its name is doing extremely well and chances are that they will keep on doing well,” said Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com. 

 “There is one investing principle that investors could use - anything that doubles once chances are that it will double again and again and again that is the power of compounding,” he added. 

 Most of the stocks which have 'Bharat' in their name are government-owned companies which are already trading way below their respective peak valuations. 

 However, most of these stocks have doubled in the last three months on the prospects of pro-growth reforms from the new government to kick start investment cycle and boost growth in Asia’s third largest economy. 

 Another reason highlighted by analysts is that most of these companies have fallen out of favour in the last decade due to unfavourable government policies. 

 PSUs mcap has shrunk to 20 per cent of BSE 100 at present compared with 32 per cent in March 2005. Lower proportion of mcap offers significant room to investors to increase exposure and secure risk-reward ratio, ET reported. 

 “If government can take hard decisions, then the Indian growth story is here to stay and most stocks under the name Bharat may very well outperform benchmark indices,” said A K Prabhakar, Independent Market Expert. 

 “Most of the Bharat stocks are PSUs other than BHARAT FORGE and have the potential to become multibaggers from current levels,” he added.

The net profit soared to Rs 34.39 crore in Q4 of CY10 as compared to Rs 25.40 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The net sales of the company has shown a 23.5% growth to Rs 355.85 crore as compared to Rs 288.09 crore in Q4 of CY09. 
  
  At 9:45 am, shares of the company were trading 1.03% up at Rs 352.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The profit-before-tax (PBT) of the company in Q4 of CY10 has gone up by 42.6% to Rs 142.99 crore against Rs 100.26 crore in the same period last year. 
  
  For the entire CY10, Bata India’s net profit has soared to Rs 95.35 crore — growth of 41.84% over the previous year. The net sales of the company in CY10 went up by 14.41% to Rs 1,256.85 crore from Rs 1,090.17 crore in CY09. 
  
  Bata India attributes this growth to the new retail strategy adopted by the company. Bata India Group Managing Director Marcelo Villagran said: “During 2010, we opened 108 stores, each with an area of more than 3,000 sq ft. With separate defined sections, offering hundreds of designs for men, ladies, children and youth, the new Bata stores offer a whole new experience to consumers. Made as per Bata's global design, the new stores use the latest retail designs and best quality furniture that enhance the store's layout and provide for an attractive product display.”"
Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/restructuring-helps-bata-india-stay-a-step-ahead/articleshow/7566695.cms,m.economictimes.com,Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,"Bata India's business-model restructuring appears to be paying off well. For the year 2010, the company clocked a growth of 42% in its standalone earnings while net sales grew by 15%. 
  
  Brand repositioning and operational restructuring were the two key areas at the heart of the revamping exercise. The company introduced and expanded high-margin premium brands such as Hush Puppies, North Star and Weinbrenner. It also optimised its chain of retail outlets by opening large-format stores, closing down the less profitable ones and renovating the rest. 
  
  On the operational front, the company began outsourcing the production of its low-cost merchandise. The key benefit of this move was a steady reduction in the overall raw material cost to 46.1% of net sales in 2010 from 48.1% three years ago. Besides, it also brought down staff costs to 13.9% of sales from 20.6% during the same period. The company is expanding its retail outlets network to enhance market reach. In 2010, it opened 108 stores, taking the total count to 1,300. It plans to open 50-60 stores in tier-II and tier-III cities annually to increase market penetration. It has also launched new complementary services such as online shopping and Bata Home Delivery service. 
  
  The benefits of these steps are already visible in the company's operating profit margins, which has improved from 8.6% in 2007 to 14% in 2010. The December quarter proved to be the best of the year, with the company clocking a year-on-year net sales growth of 23% compared with the average 11.3% year-on-year growth for the first three quarters. The operating margin for the quarter at 17.3% was also the highest; for the first three quarters, the average was 12.7%. 
  
  The company is also trying to become an approved supplier to the armed forces. It has acquired technology from its parent company to make shoes as required by the defence personnel. The demand from the domestic defence forces alone stands at 1.2 million pairs every year; if it is approved as a supplier, Bata's earnings would get a substantial boost. Another revenue booster will be development of its 260-acre land in Batanagar, near Kolkata, in a 50:50 joint venture with the Calcutta Metropolitan Group. Bata India has deployed around 73 crore since 2007 for setting up a township; the first phase is expected to be commissioned some time later in 2011.

  All these commodity related stories, steel, aluminium, copper, they are all running up this afternoon. How are you reading into the news, what do you make of it? 
  
  With China making the currency flexible, the sense that we are getting is that there would be more purchasing power and with the economy doing well, there would be more demand for base metal. So steel, copper, we will see these base metal prices going up. 
  
  If you look at Sesa Goa particularly, one of the Japanese steel manufactures have increased the purchase price by 23%, most of these companies now work on quarterly contracts. So that augurs well for Sesa Goa. Having said that with China making its currency flexible, we will see lot of liquidity flows happening in the emerging market and we expect the US dollar to depreciate between 3% to 5% in next 3 to 6 months’ time."

Analyst says Apple will hit $1tn m-cap,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/analyst-says-apple-will-hit-1tn-m-cap/articleshow/46684033.cms,m.economictimes.com,Analyst says Apple will hit $1tn m-cap,"As Apple gets ready to launch its first new product in five years, Cantor Fitzgerald is raising its price target to a level that would make Apple a $1 trillion company. 

 People first started talking seriously about the potential for Apple to become a trillion dollar company in February when shares reached news highs. The current stock price of $127 a share gives the company a valuation of $744 billion. Cantor analyst Brian White currently has the highest price target on Wall Street. 

 It's not just the launch of the Apple Watch that has White so bullish. He's also optimistic about Apple's iPhone portfolio in China, which he says is poised to benefit from a new upgrade cycle following the expanding 4G network, as well as potential new areas of interest such as an electric car. To top that off, he believes Apple will continue to return cash to shareholders, with more coming next month. 

 ""We believe the combination of these forces will drive the market to reward Apple's stock with an expanded P/E multiple, and we are raising our 12-month price target to $180 (~$1T cap; from $160).""

Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/capacity-addition-to-help-apl-apollo/articleshow/6695006.cms,m.economictimes.com,Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,"Stock of APL Apollo Tubes, a Delhi-based steel tube manufacturer, has consistently outperformed the markets with yearly returns of 160% compared to a 20% rise in Sensex. The company’s recently commissioned capacities and the planned acquisition of Lloyds Line Pipes is set to give a booster to its earnings in the coming quarters.
  
  Incorporated in 1986, APL Apollo Tubes is a manufacturer and exporter of steel pipes and tubes. It produces a wide range of steel tubes including black tubes, galvanised tubes, pre-galvanised tubes and hollow sections.
  
  The company doubled its production capacity to 4 lakh tonnes per annum by adding a new plant in Hosur. The plant, which was under trial runs till July, will make its presence felt from the September quarter. The new plant will cater to the growing demand from South India.
  
  The company has also forged a strategic partnership with a leading distributor, Shankara Pipes, under which the company will allot around 2% of its equity shares on preferential basis to the latter at `176 each. This is at around 11% premium to its current market price. The relationship is expected to help in increasing the company’s presence in southern and western markets.
  
  At present, the exports account for only about 5% of APL Apollo’s revenue, which the copmany wants to increase going forward.
  
  The recently-announced acquisition of the Maharashtra-based manufacturer of steel tubes and pipes Lloyds Line Pipes for `40 crore, which will be completed later this year, will boost the capacity by 90,000 tonne per annum besides improving access to customers in the Western region.
  
  The company reported net sales growth of 19% y-o-y in the June 2010 quarter. The company, however, saw its profit declining 18% due to presence of other income in the last year’s profit. As the company operates with low operating margins, it depends on volume to boost its profits.
  
  At the current market price of `158 the stock is trading at 15 times to trailing 12-month EPS. This is to a premium to most of its peers. However, considering its recently doubled capacities, the premium appears justified."

Profits were driven by a rise in business, coupled with an improvement in margin. Bank chairman JP Dua attributed the rise to improvement in income from core business.
   
  The bank which saw its total business touch Rs 1.96 lakh crore, aims to cross Rs 2 lakh crore by December and Rs 2.20 lakh crore by March next year, Mr Dua said. The bank’s net interest margin increased to 3.34% for the September quarter compared with 3.10% in the previous quarter. At the start of the fiscal, we announced that we would like to keep NIM over 3%. So far, we have maintained this target, Mr Dua said. 
  
  The Kolkata-based bank’s operating profit for the period rose 20% at Rs 782 crore from Rs 650 crore in the corresponding period in 2009. Total income rose 22% to Rs 2,982 crore against Rs 2,452 crore. It made a provision of Rs 379 crore towards non-performing assets, income tax and others. 
  
  Mr Dua said the bank had to make a whopping Rs 220 crore of provision only towards NPAs on account of agriculture debt relief scheme. The scheme expired on June this year but a significant chunk of farmers did not avail of the benefit, making them defaulters of bank loans. 
  
  Gross NPA ratio deteriorated to 1.77% as on September 2010 from 1.5% three months ago. Net NPAs deteriorated to 0.56% from 0.41% due to rising incidents of defaults in the farm sector. The bank is adequately capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.49%. Yet, it has headroom of Rs 2,600 crore to raise capital."

Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/catch-up-game-bse-mid-cap-index-trails-bigger-peers/articleshow/32635789.cms,m.economictimes.com,Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,"The BSE mid-cap index, which rallied in tandem with the benchmark indices in 2007 to touch an all-time high, has under-performed over the last 18 months as projected earnings growth at the start of FY14 was much lower when calculated on an annualised basis. The projected earnings growth for the BSE mid-cap index in April 2013 was over 25%, which has now been lowered down to 16per cent. Though the benchmark indices are trading at an all-time high, the BSE mid-cap is trading 33per cent away from the lifetime peak it scaled in 2007.
 
 Over the last one year, the BSE mid-cap index has been under-performing the Nifty as most of its constituents have witnessed a gradual downward revision in earnings. The majority of constituents or companies which constitute the BSE mid-cap index have seen a downward revision, as most brokerages had pinned hopes of a recovery in growth from the third quarter of FY14. The brokerages have built in a profit contribution of over 55-60per cent in the second half of FY14, but with little changes in the macro environment and muted demand, they were bound to revise their earnings downward.
 
 According to Bloomberg, the mid-cap index EPS for FY14 has fallen by 20per cent to 485 since September last year. On the other hand, the Nifty’s EPS for FY14 has been upgraded by 9per cent to 452 during the same period. Of the 216 constituents of the BSE mid-cap, only 32 stocks have seen an upward revision of EPS since September 2013.
 
 On the valuation front, the BSE Mid-cap Index is trading at a lower valuation compared with the Nifty. The difference of P/E (price-earning) multiple of two indices, which is known as PE spread shows the amount of premium or discount an investor is willing to pay to buy for a higher risk mid-cap stock.
 
 If the PE spread is lower than the historical average, it indicates that investors are not overtly bullish about the mid-cap stocks compared to benchmark indices with limited prospects for a build-up in the stock. In 2007, on a historical basis, the BSE mid-cap PE (price-earnings) was trading at a premium valuation to the Nifty. The BSE Mid-cap was trading at 23 times in November 2007 when the Nifty traded at 21 times.
 
 Among the constituents of the BSE Midcap, companies whose EPS has been revised upwards, have seen a significant gain since the start of the year. Even the interest of institutional investors such as foreign institutional investors and also mutual funds had been largely concentrated on companies of the BSE midcap constituents where they perceive a fair amount of revenue visibility and see an upward revision in EPS. That is why midcap stocks that rallied recently were the ones whose EPS were upgraded by analysts.
 
 Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Bharat Forge and IPCA have seen a consistent increase in FII holding during the last three quarters. From the start of the year, the BSE mid-cap gained 434 points, of which 80per cent of the contribution came from stocks such as Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, MRF, IPCA, and TVS Motors. Among these, Aurobindo Pharma received the highest EPS upgradation of 23per cent due to which its stock appreciated by 36per cent. Besides this, Apollo Tyres’ stock gained 34per cent as its EPS was upgraded by 21per cent."

Oil rebounds in Asia on bargain hunting,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/oil-rebounds-in-asia-on-bargain-hunting/articleshow/29485117.cms,m.economictimes.com,Oil rebounds in Asia on bargain hunting,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices rebounded in Asian trade today on bargain hunting following sharp falls stoked by turbulence in global financial markets, as nervous traders await the US Federal Reserve's next move on its stimulus programme. 

 New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, was up nine cents at $95.81 in mid-morning trade while Brent North Sea crude for March gained 26 cents at $106.95. 

 WTI sank 92 cents in New York trade Monday while Brent fell $1.19 in London, tracking heavy losses in global equity markets spurred by weak corporate earnings and uncertainty in emerging economies. 

 Financial markets have also been shaken by data last week indicating manufacturing activity in China -- the world's top energy consumer and a key driver of global growth -- had contracted in January. 

 ""Markets remain skittish and the mood is somewhat cautious as the focus remains on emerging market travails,"" French lender Credit Agricole said in a note. 

 ""The current bout of pressure may yet be contained but there is still some way to go before market stress is alleviated,"" it said. 

 Kelly Teoh, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said investors were also keenly awaiting the outcome of a two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled to end tomorrow. 

 The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to decide on a further $10 billion reduction in its monthly asset purchases, to $65 billion. 

 In December, the FOMC said it would begin tapering the stimulus by $10 billion to $75 billion a month in January. 

 The so-called tapering of the Fed's asset purchases would likely boost the greenback, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for countries using other currencies, dampening demand."

Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: Last hour strategies for the last trading session of this year, what is the call? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: On the index, we still have not changed our stance. But given the fact that we are getting close to the upper end of the range which is around 8300, there is a good chance that we might see some momentum come. In that case we may close above levels of 8300. Lot of individual stocks, specific names are breaking out and giving nice movement. The breadth is about 2.5 is to 1. That is a very positive side. So the chances are that if not today, maybe in the next one-two days, we might get a breakout above 8300. That could possibly suggest further upside in the Nifty in the short term."

 NSE Nifty futures' open interest has been on a decline since March 3, but Bank Nifty futures' aggregate OI remained positive during the same period.Meanwhile, SGX Nifty futures' aggregate open interest remains near the year's peak touched February 26.
 
 Total F&O turnover in Indian exchanges continues to rise after March derivative series became active. Bulk of the action is witnessed in index call options, which are probably seeing unwinding after Nifty hit a peak on March 4. This reasoning is also supported by the rise in the PC ratio of index open interest. It has been on a rise lately, but is still below a year's average.
 PC ratio of stocks' OI is also below average, and there is hardly any stock active in the F&O segment with PC ratio above 1. It is possible that the recent price falls in stocks may have attracted more interest in calls, but such a bias increases the risk of magnifying falls if stocks were to slide further. 

 Meanwhile, FII net equity investment remained positive since February 16. However, the combined trade volume of cash segment in NSE & BSE has remained below a year's average for over two weeks now, suggesting that traders in the equity segment are looking for fresh cues after Budget announcement. 

 India VIX, an indicator of volatility based on the Nifty index option prices is at 17.38, and has been easing since February derivatives' expiry. Open interest distribution across the put-call spectrum of Nifty hints at 8600-9000 as the region that traders have estimated the price moves to be in, in the event of a rise in volatility."
Hold on to IT stocks: Deven Choksey,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/deven-choksey-on-2-stocks-that-can-emerge-multibaggers-in-next-5-years/articleshow/92974035.cms,m.economictimes.com,Deven Choksey on 2 stocks that can emerge as multibaggers in next 5 years,"“In every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money,” says Deven Choksey, MD, KRChoksey Holdings Pvt. Ltd. 

We saw a smart 2% upmove on the Bank Nifty and the IndusInd Bank counter was high by 4.5% yesterday. Kotak Bank was high by almost 3.5% in trade. Has the time for banks finally arrived? We are talking about the capex cycle which can also be played.I guess the time cannot be better than this, wherein it reassures us that the economy is progressing well. Banks are progressing as far as lending is concerned. Up till now, private banks have been concentrating on the retail side of the book, which they continue to do but in the last quarter and a little earlier, from January to March till now and from April to June quarter, systematically the corporate lending side of the book has started increasing.
 
The growth rate in that particular area has also increased. In my view, the corporate credit offtake is taking place at this point of time and no wonder because on one hand, the infrastructure-led spending is happening in the economy and PLI schemes are outside the interactive new investment into the economy. At the same time, most of the companies are getting ready for the next phase of growth – call it Brownfield or Greenfield expansion.
 
All in all, put together, the bank’s credit requirement is on the higher side. At the same time, with the rise in commodity prices, the requirement for working capital has started increasing for most of the corporates and they are again asking banks to fund them. As a result, we had seen the credit offtake. So maybe, the results should reflect into what you call companies earnings in subsequent quarters but the lending activity starts now, the sanctioning of the loans starts now and should this particular thing continue, we are going to see the next two to four quarters reflecting the earnings.
 
With a higher amount of growth, and that is where I would argue that some of the larger banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI, need to be considered for the portfolio largely because of the fact that the sheer size is slowing. At the same time, the business condition is improving and these banks remained very disciplined during the pandemic period and did not expand their book, Now they are getting an opportunity to expand their book size with the kind of alpha payment side, I think it is a better time to buy as far as the timing is concerned in the market.
 

Why do you enjoy this reputation that you are never bearish? It is very difficult to find a sell idea from Deven Choksey? We were definitely bullish in every condition because in my career span of more than three decades, at every stage, this market has seen higher amount of growth, whatever the situation in the economy has been. I have done some eight year cycle analysis and I think in every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money. 
 
So I remain bullish of course for the India economy and its growth. Also, we are now probably into the $5-trillion zone, sooner than later and in such a situation, we need to remain bullish because the market cap is likely to double from current levels. All in all, put together, if one wants to make money from the stock market, it is always good to remain an optimist. But things can go wrong even after remaining optimistic.

 

If I have to put a graphic which says Deven’s multibagger idea or ideas for this decade – stocks which can make a lot of wealth in five, six years – which will be those one, two, three names?There are a couple of stocks where I probably keep my focus on currently. I feel HDFC, HDFC Life as a combination is triggering a Rs 50 lakh- crore AUM company. In the next four and a half to five years, should they continue with a growth rate of around 20% odd in the housing finance portfolio, the possibility of continuing with this kind of a growth rate is very high.
 
In retail also, the growth rate on a larger base of AUM will continue to be very high. In the corporate sector, they would be more cautious but I would still think that around 15-16% kind of a growth rate is definitely possible on a larger base. Should this particular portfolio of lending continue to grow at this pace, then on a Rs 50 lakh crore size balance sheet, somewhere in 4.5-5 years time from now, I think this combination could give a nice reward. Even if you compound the return at 25%, you will get a reasonably good amount of appreciation in a four to five years’ time frame. So this is one company which is probably right to buy into. 
 
The second stock where we believe the opportunity is emerging stronger is going to be L&T Technology Services. I would think that beyond the kind of engineering services that they have, coupled with IT and the way the economy is growing and the investment space, would demand higher IT usage after even 5G comes in. This is going to be more of a trusted space. This company is a niche player like Tata Elxsi in the engineering-based IT solutions and that is where I believe that staying with this company for four, five years could give multi bagger returns, something that we have experienced in the case of Tata Elxsi."
Nine banks keen on Hind Copper FPO mandate,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/nine-banks-keen-on-hind-copper-fpo-mandate/articleshow/6091097.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nine banks keen on Hind Copper FPO mandate,"BANGALORE: Hindustan Copper’s chairman and managing director Shakeel Ahmed said on Thursday that nine investment banks have shown interest in managing the firm’s follow-on public offer (FPO). He added that the company will finalise the names before the end of the month. “We are planning our FPO in September or October this year.” 
  
  “Nine banks, including DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak, ICICI Securities, SBI Capital Markets, IDBI, UBS, IDFC-SSKI besides Avendus Capital and Enam, are keen to participate in our fund-raising exercise,” he said. Mr Ahmed clarified that while the FPO will see the company dilute only 20% of its equity, the balance 5-6% will be done subsequently to meet the new minimum public shareholding norm of 25%. Currently a minuscule 0.41% of the company’s equity is traded on the bourses. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said the company was planning to raise funds to partially finance its Rs 4,580- crore capex plans. This investment, which will be done over the next 5-6 years, will see close to 70% funds being raised through equity dilution, the balance being debt and internal accruals. 
  
  The capex will see HCL hiking production capacity at its Khetri (Rajasthan) plant to 3.1 mt from 1 mt. Similarly, the Malanjikhand (Jharkhand) plant’s capacity will rise to 5 mt from the current 2 mt. The Ghatsila (Jharkhand) unit’s new capacity will be 3.9 mt from 0.4-0.6 mt. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said that HCL will expand copper exploration and mining activity as copper consumption has risen due to rapid economic growth. “India’s current consumption is only 5.5 lakh tonne and we lag behind China and the US, which consume 61 lakh tonne and 19 lakh tonne respectively,” he added. He said that the Rajasthan government had recommended the firm’s name for copper mining at Bannivaliki Dhani. HCL was scouting for mines in Chile and Namibia. 
  
  “These are still at a nascent stage. There are a lot of regulatory issues like ownership pattern of the venture, mining rights and the like,” he added. Mr Ahmed said that the company had begun a dialogue with Karnataka’s Hutti Gold Mines to revive the copper mines at Chitradurga. 
  
  “HCL could look at a joint-venture or outright purchase or a supply contract from this mine, which has reserves of nearly 2 mt, and closed in 2001 as global copper prices fell to $ 2,500 per tonne,” he added. HCL shares inched up 0.49% to Rs 495.3 on Thursday."

ET Now: Your first reaction to HDFC Bank, numbers are in line with estimates, asset quality has been stable, the overhang on the FIPB approval is still leading to the under performance on the stock what do you do here, what are you advising clients?  Gaurang Shah: We have recently come out with overall view on the banking and NBFC segment and wherein we have upgraded the targets for most of the private sector banks and HDFC is one of them.  A target stand at about close to 800-820 and our belief is that the performance that we have seen over the last couple of quarters has been quite consistent though there has been a slight bit of deterioration.  Given the way both HDFC and HDFC Bank has created value for an individual portfolio, my understanding is that notwithstanding what happens in the short term, if you look at the long term then definitely both these stocks they add value to an individual’s portfolio. so I would say hold on to it."
"FDI, discom policies show reform momentum intact: Fitch",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fdi-discom-policies-show-reform-momentum-intact-fitch/articleshow/49756732.cms,m.economictimes.com,"FDI, discom policies show reform momentum intact: Fitch","NEW DELHI: Fitch Ratings has said liberalisation of foreign investment rules announced earlier this week is a significant structural macroeconomic reform and the recent proposal to de-stress power distribution sector indicates that India's reform momentum remains intact. 

 There has been worry that after the setback suffered by the ruling NDA in the Bihar elections reforms momentum may slow down. 

 “The FDI and disco (distribution companies) announcements highlight how the government can make reform progress using its regulatory and executive powers,” Fitch said in a statement adding that reforms indicate India’s reforms momentum remains intact. 
 

 On Tuesday, in a significant reform of its foreign direct investment policy, the government had opened up as many as 15 sectors more, lifting caps for many sectors, putting others on automatic routed and easing other conditions for others, notably brand retail. 

 The power sector package announced on November 5, seeks to reboot the burdened distribution sector by transferring three-fourth of their debt to respective state government and archiving the rest 25% through long term bonds. 

 “These changes align with the government's broad-based reform agenda, and should support investment and real GDP growth over the long term,” said Fitch, said adding that the two measures suggest government can press ahead with reforms. 

 There is fear that the government will find it difficult to push through legislative reforms after the Bihar setback with emboldened opposition raising the pitch on some of the contentious measures, a point noted by Fitch. 

 It said: “However, other big reforms such as the implementation of a national value added tax, will require a two-thirds approval in the legislature and face stiffer political obstacles.” 

 The government wants to roll out GST from April 1, 2016 but the legislation needed to do so is stuck in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling coalition does not have a majority. 

 The ratings agency has forecast 7.5% growth in the current financial year and 8% each in the next two years. 

 Fitch noted that power package could raise general government debt up to 2% of GDP, but added this was not likely to impact India's ratings because of the positive impact of other reforms. 

 “Importantly, the reforms create an incentive structure for state governments to reduce losses at discos by requiring the state governments to assume a certain share of losses at these entities,” it said."
Broader markets valuations look attractive: Ambit Capital,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/broader-markets-valuations-look-attractive-ambit-capital/articleshow/21000783.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Broader markets valuations look attractive: Ambit Capital,"MUMBAI: The midcaps and smallcaps have been underperforming the Sensex on Y-o-Y basis. The recent volatility in the Indian markets due to rupee depreciation has also put pressure on the broader markets. 

 Gaurav Mehta, Technical Analyst, Ambit Capital is of the view that while the Nifty is at the beginning of a bull run, the valuations of broader markets look attractive as compared to largecaps. 

 ""Relative valuations of small caps to large caps (as measured by a P/B ratio of BSE Small Cap Index to BSE Sensex are at multi-year lows; historically these cheap valuations have been followed by market rallies. A similar picture can be painted for the relative valuations of mid caps to large caps suggesting broader markets offer good value, both absolutely and more so on a relative basis,"" he said. 

 According to him, a long run bullish phase is around the corner for Indian equities. He sees the Nifty testing 6,350 over the next few weeks and successfully breach it on the upside. 

 ""Nifty on log, weekly charts has carved out an ascending triangle over the last few years. Such patterns are usually resolved to the upside implying a breakout from the 6,300-6,400 resistance range is a high likelihood over the next few weeks. More importantly the major uptrend that we embarked upon in 2003 is still intact as well. On the flip side, 5,650-5,700 should be a region of strong long term support for the index,"" he added. 

 The ""Real"" or inflation adjusted Nifty suggests that the secular uptrend that started in 2003 is still intact for Indian equities, he says. 

 ""While downsides should be limited to the lower trendline (we are there already currently), a resolution of this pattern to the upside would imply massive upsides in the months ahead- this implies risk reward is favorable for buying Indian equities,"" he said. 

 At 12:40 p.m.; the S&P BSE Sensex was at 19,446.42, up 6.94 points or 0.04 per cent. The index has gained 10.23 per cent in one-year period.

After a gap of two years, jewellery exporters are witnessing orders coming from the US for jewellery and the units operating in Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) in Mumbai are flooded with enquiries. 

 The US jobs data for June has also sparked a fresh hope among jewellers. The US economy added a net 195,000 new jobs in June, official figures show. The figure is well above economists’ expectations of 165,000. 

 “Jewellers are expecting a 25%-30% growth in the US market in the current fiscal. The US is gradually coming out of recession and this is reflected in the enquiries that are coming from the country. We are seeing this sort of a demand after a gap of almost two years,” said Vipul Shah, chairman of Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council. 

 An increase in exports of gem and jewellery is a good news for the government which is trying hard to control the rising current account deficit (CAD) by curbing gold imports through a slew of measures. But for jewellery exporters, the government is ready to walk an extra mile. 

 Shah said Union commerce minister Anand Sharma has held a meeting with jewellery exporters and assured them of a steady supply of gold for exports. “He said that if any nominated agencies fail to supply gold, he would take action against them,” Shah said. 

 The jewellery units operating in SEEPZ are receiving a good flow of orders. Rajeev S Pandya, past president, SEEPZ Gems & Jewellery Manufacturers Association, said: “There has been an improvement in order position from June end. The industry had organised a jewellery show in Las Vegas in early June. The samples shown there have been well accepted by customers and they have started placing orders. 

 These are orders for the Christmas season. Some of the units in SEEPZ have their hands full while some have started receiving orders from the US. The US is compensating for the loss in Europe.” The Europe market is still reeling under a crisis and jewellers do not see an immediate recovery in that market. 

 “However, the West Asia and China markets are showing a good growth,” said Shah."

Jagdish Malkani: I would be probably looking at some midcaps because they have to play catch up right now as I say Raja chalta hai, abhi praja has still to follow and we will see a bit of that next week. Lots of good quality midcaps languishing still not joined the party at all. 

 
ET Now: But do you see that as the follow next step, do you think that over the next few sessions we have first see the large cap buying interest come in there and then perhaps trickle into the broader markets? 

 
Jagdish Malkani: It has already happened let us face it 300 Nifty points have been largely led by banking and a few sectors that too mostly the private banks and SBI in particular. So you will have catch up in those sectors but as I said mostly I would begin to see that some good quality midcaps will join in and there is some more upside to global liquidity. This whole triple benefit effect is sinking in of lower crude, lower gold and lower inflation so all that is we should have a good time ahead."

Airbus sparks relief rally as Q1 profit beats forecasts,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/airbus-sparks-relief-rally-as-q1-profit-beats-forecasts/articleshow/35062066.cms,m.economictimes.com,Airbus sparks relief rally as Q1 profit beats forecasts,"PARIS: Airbus Group posted better than expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sparking a relief rally in its shares as it dodged the impact of higher costs for its new A350 jet, which remains on track for a late-2014 debut.


	Shares in the world's second-largest aerospace group after Boeing rose by around 5 per cent to 51.92 euros, their highest in more than a month, after it issued an upbeat report on A350 testing and exceeded profit forecasts by about 10 per cent.


	""This is a very good start to the year and guidance remains unchanged,"" Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note to investors. Airbus shares had fallen 11 percent since the start of the year, underperforming Boeing, which raked in more orders than its European arch-rival in the first quarter. The Franco-German company is among a number of European exporters facing concerns over recent gains in the euro.


	First-quarter operating income before one-off items fell by a smaller than expected 4.6 per cent to 700 million euros ($963 million) as revenue rose 5 per cent to 12.6 billion, and analysts said it had improved execution on key programmes.


	Analysts were on average expecting underlying quarterly operating income to fall 13 percent to 644 million euros on revenue of 12.4 billion, according to a poll. 

	Confirming recent comments by Europe's aviation regulator, Airbus Group said its latest jetliner, the A350, was ""progressing towards certification"" in the third quarter in time for first delivery by the end of the year to Qatar Airways.


	Completing Europe's answer to the lightweight carbon-composite Boeing 787 Dreamliner is seen as the biggest issue facing the Franco-German group as it tries to boost margins and avoid technical problems and delays experienced by its rival.


	 

	The head of the European Aviation Safety Agency said last week the A350's safety certification, the key milestone before any new aircraft's delivery, appeared to be on track for the end of the summer barring any new hiccups.


	Industry sources say it could come as soon as the end of August, but Airbus remains wary of problems that blighted previous civil and military programmes and has boosted support spending to ensure a smooth first delivery and ramp-up in production.


	""The A350 is in a critical phase, and challenges and risks remain,"" Finance Director Harald Wilhelm told reporters.


	IMPROVING A380


	Airbus struck an even more cautious note on its flagship jetliner, the double-decker A380 superjumbo, saying it was ""acting on the lessons"" gleaned from six years in service.


	It is taking advantage of the first heavy maintenance overhauls to incorporate improvements after recent glitches that include problems with door noise, Wilhelm said. A cargo door alert reportedly forced an A380 to turn around last week.


	Despite disappointing sales, Airbus still aims to break even on the jet in 2015 and expects to deliver 30 this year and next. Airbus also reaffirmed plans to cut 5,800 jobs as part of a restructuring of the company's defence and space division, where Wilhelm expected talks with unions to be completed in mid-year.


	Airbus said Turkey had taken its first delivery of the A400M military transporter after a stand-off that delayed delivery and distracted attention from its previous results. Airbus meanwhile reported another hefty outflow of cash in the first quarter as it earmarks liquidity for major projects.


	Free cashflow before acquisitions came in at a negative figure of 2 billion euros, but this was less than some analysts had feared and well below the 3.2 billion seen a year earlier.


	Airbus is aiming for stable free cashflow for the year. Revenue at Airbus Helicopters rose 14 per cent, and operating profit at the former Eurocopter unit almost trebled compared with the same quarter a year ago when flight restrictions in the wake of a series of incidents hit Super Puma deliveries."

  Prakash Diwan, Head - Institutional Business, Networth Stock Broking in an interview with ET Now talks about the auto space.
   
  
  What is the call on the front line counters, Bajaj Auto came out with a very stellar quarter, do you think this momentum can sustain in the next few quarters as well?
   
  Even if it does, it is not really going to do much to its margin expansion. Today Bajaj is already facing the brunt of the higher input cost which we have been talking about since the last couple of quarters. So unless until commodity prices especially metal prices really see a little bit of easing off and it stays at where it is really not going to be easy for the likes of Bajaj which are into huge volumes to be able to benefit from that. 
  
  Given the fact that Hero Honda has become more attractive, we are expecting some shift in portfolios from Bajaj to Hero Honda which has been lying lower and has been shot down quite a bit thanks to all the news flow that we have seen there and that is one of the reasons where some reallocation could probably see money coming out of Bajaj and moving into Hero Honda. 
  
  Overall auto pack for different reason it is one of the most defensive states in terms of any sector if you look at and it is all consumption driven, it is all localised, it is going to do nothing to do too much with foreign exchanges. So it is a sector to be into even in these uncertain times.

The Pune-based Bajaj group flagship said net profit in the October-December period rose to Rs 475 crore, from Rs 164 crore last year. Its revenue in the same period surged 57% to Rs 3,295 crore.The quarter saw an increase in cost of raw material, mainly steel and in the price of components. “However, due to higher volumes and by leveraging fixed cost and cost management, we were able to achieve operating margin at 22% during the third quarter, against 14.5% last year,” said finance vice-president Kevin D’sa.Bajaj Auto, which competes strongly with market leader Hero Honda in the high margin two-wheeler market, sold 809,218 units in the third quarter, a 64% jump over the previous year. The robust sales reflected a turnaround in the economic situation, which had been hit adversely in 2008, as tight liquidity and slow demand dented auto sales.Analysts said this has been Bajaj Auto’s best quarter, surpassing even the second quarter. The strategy to focus on ‘bigger and sportier’ motorcycles helped the company grow its market share, they said. “The results weren’t surprising and reflects the underlining efforts of the company in regaining lost market share,” said Mahantesh Sabarad, an analyst at Centrum Broking.Apart from increased market share, Bajaj Auto has been able to boost its cash flow. Mr D’sa said it has surplus cash and cash equivalents of Rs 2,625 crore, against Rs 933 crore as on March last year. Shares of Bajaj Auto ended 1.7%, up at Rs 1,698.10 on BSE on Tuesday. After countering the slow demand scenario last year, Indian two-wheeler makers have focused on the growing rural market through bigger products, which has helped in increasing volumes and margins.A Bajaj Auto executive said while the shift away from 100cc economy motorcycles initially did put pressure on sales, it has paid in terms of market share and profitability. Industry sales in the motorcycle segment rose by 37%, while Bajaj Auto sales rose 72% at 7.11 lakh units. The newly-launched Pulsar 135 LS is expected to add to the company’s market share in motorcycles and enable the Pulsar brand reach one million-a-year in sales. During the third quarter, Bajaj Auto also launched upgraded versions of its three-wheeler passenger carriers. Exports rose 27% to 2.73 lakh units."

"BHEL: Good show in FY13, but far from best",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bhel-good-show-in-fy13-but-far-from-best/articleshow/19453246.cms,m.economictimes.com,"BHEL: Good show in FY13, but far from best","The stock of state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals, or BHEL, gained over 2.5% to close at Rs 182 on Monday as the company is likely to report a better-than-expected financial performance for the financial year 2013. 

 The key highlight of BHEL’s provisional, or flash, results for the financial year was the stupendous growth in order inflows. At Rs 31,528 crore, BHEL reported a 43% rise in new orders compared with Rs 22,096 crore in FY12 when the base was very low. But it is still far off from the Rs 60,500 crore in new orders the company had reported in FY11. 

 In fact, at Rs 1.15 lakh crore, BHEL’s order book at the end of FY13 is only a notch higher than its order backlog of Rs 1,13,700 crore at the end of December 2012. This order book is, however, the lowest for the company in four years. The management expects order inflows to improve significantly in FY14. Institutional investors’ expectations from BHEL continue to be mixed. 

 Local fund managers, who have reservations about earnings visibility and order inflows, have further reduced their shareholding in the company to 1% at the end of FY13 from 1.44% at the beginning of the year, while foreign institutional investors, or FIIs, increased their shareholding to 14.75% from 13.49% a year ago. This is by far the lowest holding by mutual funds in the company in at least 12 years or since March 2001. 

 The cautious approach of these investors is on account of execution difficulties the company is facing and may continue to face even in the near term due to slowing economic growth. Even though the company expects to see its turnover top Rs 50,000 crore for the very first time (going by the provisional numbers), the fact is this is a mere 1% growth in turnover from a year ago. 

 Similarly, at Rs 6,485 crore, BHEL’s provisional net profit is 8% lower than the previous year. The management maintains that there is no significant negative impact on operating margins, citing improvements in localisation processes and cost efficiencies. The company is also increasingly focusing on developing indigenous research and development, or R&D, to help reduce costs in the coming months. 

 According to Amit Patil, Research Analyst, Angel Broking, slow execution on account of client deferrals due to slowdown in investment cycle and various problems in the power sector continue to remain an overhang on the stock. Given this backdrop, it is tough to make a call on whether the stock price of BHEL will continue to gain momentum.
 
 KEY POINTS 

 At Rs 31,528 cr, BHEL reported a 43% rise in new orders compared with Rs 22,096 cr in FY12. But it is still way below the Rs 60,500 cr in new orders the co reported in FY11. At Rs 6,485 cr, BHEL’s provisional net profit is 8% lower than the previous year."

The Yash Birla-led company has planned an investment of 10,000 crore over the next five years to foray into thermal and solar power. 
  
  At 9:50 am, shares of Birla Power Solutions were trading 2.70% up at Rs 1.14 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  For this, Birla Power Solutions may sell up to 15% stake in itself or up to 26% in its subsidiary, Birla Urja, to a private equity player, PVR Murthy said. 
  
  ""We are talking to 3-4 global private equity investors. Traditionally, we have not had institutional investors but if we are growing big, we need to have them,"" Murthy said. The company could induct a representative of the PE fund on the board of the company. 
  
  ""We would rope in their professional practices. We have no issue if they come in at parent company level or at subsidiary level,"" Murthy said. 
  
  The company has a market capitalisation of 239 crore. For expansion into the power sector, Birla Power Solutions will need an equity investment of 2,000 crore, while the balance 8,000 crore would be funded through debt. 
  
  Birla Power will also undertake a global depository receipt issue and promoters will infuse funds via warrant conversion to boost the company's equity base. Promoters currently hold 4.04% in the company. They also hold warrants, which on conversion would raise the holding to around 13%, Murthy said."

  ET Now
  , 
  Sharmila Joshi
  , Co-Head PCG Sales, Emkay Global Financial Services, talks about Blue Star and Voltas. Excerpts:
  
  
  What are your two picks?
  
  Both are interrelated in a way. I am talking of Blue Star and Voltas. So there is a commonality in the sense of the kind of business that they do. If you look at the quarter 4 numbers for both the companies, they have been really way ahead of our expectations and as a result of which, we find that whatever we had been talking of earlier that going forward it will be the MEP, mechanical, electrical and plumbing which is going to be driving the business for both these companies. That seems to be playing out. So essentially, to just focus on Blue Star, we see that every segment that they are into, they have done well. They will continue to do better in all of them. Room air conditioners will be a focus again because you will see 25% plus growth there and the under penetration in the other businesses as well will mean very good order inflows for both the MEP division as well. So going forward, margins will improve from the kind of levels that they are at currently. So Blue Star is a stock that we like and we have a target of 464 for Blue Star. 
  
  
  What about Voltas? 
  
  Numbers have been even better. If you look at the quarter 4 FY10 performance, it has really been way ahead of our estimate. The interesting thing for Voltas also is the fact that their FY11, whatever order book that we have estimated is already with them. So there will be a further uptick if anything in the stock if they get better orders from hereon. So for both is going to be the progression from the HVAC play to MEP as well as the fact that there is an under penetration in all the markets that they are in and the fact that room air conditioners will continue to grow at 25% plus. So Voltas post numbers has already given you a good run up from the kind of 184-185 levels that it was at but this is a stock that we continue to like with a target of about 234. 
  
  
  So both are really a play on a growing middle class in the country, right? 
  
  Absolutely and in the capital goods space, it is either the consumption story or the fact that you will increasingly see focus on industrial capex. Those are the type of ideas that we like, for instance McNally Bharat would be another stock where the focus is clearly on industrial capex. Petron Engineering would be another interesting stock to look at in the current environment. So yes, those are the kind of stories that the market likes, one which are directly linked to domestic consumption and other story in the capital goods space of industrial capex."

Calculus: Jet Airways international operations to ensure stable revenues,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/calculus-jet-airways-international-operations-to-ensure-stable-revenues/articleshow/30151927.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Calculus: Jet Airways international operations to ensure stable revenues,"Though Jet Airways’ losses widened to Rs 267 crore in the December 2013 quarter against a profit of Rs 85 crore a year ago, its growing focus on international operations could be earnings-per-share accretive for investors in the long term. 

 Over the last two years, the contribution of Jet Airways India’s international operations to its overall revenues has increased from about 55% to 58%, helped by the Jet-Etihad deal, superior operational performance overseas and higher yield. The sale of 24% stake to the Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways offers Jet Airways not only access to the Middle East but also to Europe and North America. 

 Its international operations have been better than domestic services, which have been hit by high fuels costs, competition and price-sensitive travellers. Thanks to its performance overseas, the airline’s yield or revenue passenger per kilometre is on the rise. For Jet Airways, the breakeven seat factor for its international operations is 86.1%; it is 80% for domestic operations. 

 Besides, the average gross revenue per passenger for its international operations is Rs 14,406, while it is Rs 5,825 for its domestic operations. The company’s cost per available kilometre for its international operations is Rs 3.3, compared to Rs 5.6 for local operations. Unlike the domestic market, which is price-sensitive , estimates show 60% of outbound travellers are not impacted by higher ticket prices considering they are on business and corporate travel. 

 That means the airline’s focus on international operations will ensure reasonably stable revenues. This strategy has also pushed its yield, which rose to . 4.89 from Rs 3.9 in the December 2011 quarter. 

 Etihad Airways will play a critical role in boosting the contribution of international operations to Jet’s total revenues. The Rs 3,000 crore Jet received from Etihad for a 24% stake helped it cut debt to Rs 10,895 crore in December 2013 from Rs 12,495 crore in the September 2013 quarter. 

 On valuation, Jet is a contrarian investment , and given its size of operations, the stock should see a re-rating in two years. Jet is trading at a one-year forward EV/ sales of 0.79, which, according to Bloomberg’s analysts’ poll, is expected to come down further to 0.69 in FY15.
 
 In the quarter to December 2013, the company’s net revenues grew by 7.3% to Rs 4,229 crore on a year-on-year basis. An increase in employee costs and fuel expenses in the December quarter eroded the company’s revenues. 

 Shares of Jet Airways lost 2.54% to close at . 228.5 on the BSE on Friday."

Equity markets likely to shine as Rupee's depreciation slows,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/equity-markets-likely-to-shine-as-rupees-depreciation-slows/articleshow/46695167.cms,m.economictimes.com,Equity markets likely to shine as Rupee's depreciation slows,"In the past one decade, excluding 2008, equity markets in Asia, where currencies depreciated strongly, performed well subsequent to such depreciations. In general, markets slide when the home currency depreciates.
 
 However, markets coming out of a currency bottom outperform the broader regional index over the following 3 to 6 months. For instance, after falling 20% in the four months from May to September 2013, the Indian rupee gained about 10% in the following six months. Sensex followed the rupee in tandem, falling some 6% as the rupee fell, and rising 15% as the rupee rose.
 
 Over the last many years, Sensex and the rupee (against the US dollar) have risen or fallen noticeably closely. Now, as the rupee depreciation slows, equity performance is likely to improve, analysts predict.
 
 “We believe that the USD rally is nearing its end. As the currency depreciation slows, equities can perform well,” says Devendra Joshi, strategist, Asia Pacifi c, HSBC. “Defensive sectors, like consumer staples, tend to outperform going into currency weakness. Consumer discretionary, banks and materials tend to lead coming out of it.”"

 In a statement, the finance ministry said the decision to raise the duty was made ""in order to fund the ambitious infrastructure development programme of the government, particularly the building of 15,000 km of roads during current and next financial year.""

FIIs returning to Bond Street as yields turn attractive,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/fiis-returning-to-bond-street-as-yields-turn-attractive/articleshow/21255976.cms,m.economictimes.com,FIIs returning to Bond Street as yields turn attractive,"MUMBAI: International investors showed signs of returning to buy Indian government bonds at the latest permits auction by Sebi, but paid low premium that indicated their interest may be conditional on higher yields in the next few weeks.
 
 Bids from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) fully covered the available permits as they sought to buy 26,000 crore worth of bonds while Sebi had put on sale permits amounting to 23,500 crore. These permits are valid for 90 days before which the investor has to buy the bonds.
 
 The latest round of bids will be encouraging for the government as it indicates a reversal in thinking by FIIs, which have pulled out 51,214 crore from Indian debt since May 22 amid rising attractiveness of US bonds and the fear that the Indian rupee may slide to new lows eroding their capital.
 
 ""They (FIIs) believe the currency will stabilise and yields at current level are a very attractive level to get in,"" said NS Venkatesh, head of treasury at IDBI Bank. ""They expect short-term rates to come off in a month or so and that is when they expect to make money when bond prices rise.""
 
 Indian bonds have turned unattractive after yields fell to a low of 7.1% on May 15 when the central bank reduced the repo rate.
 
 
Positive Response
 
 
  Repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends to banks. But US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's May 22 signal that he might taper the $85-billion monthly bond purchases - the fountain of liquidity to the emerging world - pushed up US bond yields by 100 basis points in a few weeks.
 
 The benchmark 10-year government bonds ended 15 basis points higher at 8.08% on Monday. The yields on US 10-year bonds were at 2.49%. Although numerically Indian yields are attractive, adjusting for the cost of hedging the currency, a foreign investor may still be losing 30-40 basis points in Indian government bonds.
 
 The latest round of FII response is slightly different to the previous round in June where the bids fell short of what was on offer.
 
 Fears that the central bank may reverse its interest rate stance and raise the repo rate to defend the currency is also making investors cautious. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao may raise interest rates if the currency touches 62 to the US dollar, reported Reuters citing unnamed officials in the government. The rupee fell to 59.72 to the dollar.
 
 The rupee has lost 10% since April when fears about India's current account deficit and the US turning off the liquidity tap spread. Even RBI's efforts to limit the fall had not paid off as the country's trade position also remains weak with merchandise exports falling 4.5% in June and imports rising 0.73%. RBI also banned banks from doing any proprietary trading in the currency, leading to a fall in volumes.
 
 In a roundabout way, RBI raised interest rates in the system. Last Monday, it capped the banks' borrowing through its liquidity window at 75,000 crore and lifted penal borrowing by 200 basis points to 10.25%. This led to chaos in the bond markets with yields surging as much as 63 basis points in a single day."
Five reasons why investors should subscribe to EIL OFS,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/five-reasons-why-investors-should-subscribe-to-eil-ofs/articleshow/29937623.cms,m.economictimes.com,Five reasons why investors should subscribe to EIL OFS,"NEW DELHI: Engineers India Ltd (EIL) is one of the leading design and engineering organizations in South Asia. The company provides engineering consultancy and EPC services, and is principally focused on the oil & gas and petrochemical industries.
 
 Shares of EIL have been under some pressure since 2013, down nearly 40 per cent. While for the year 2014 so far, the stock has plunged a little over 10 per cent, thus making valuation a little more compelling.
 
 The government is now putting on the block 10 per cent of its holding to raise funds before the close of this fiscal year, to boost non-tax receipts and keep fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP.
 
 The government has set a price range of Rs 145-150 a share for the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Engineers India Ltd (EIL) starting on Thursday, aimed at garnering about Rs 500 crore.
 
 EIL said a discount of Rs 6 a share will be offered to retail investors and employees. The government plans to reserve 5 per cent of the offer for employees.
 
 Shares of EIL closed at Rs 151.35 up 1.61 per cent. It hit a low of Rs 148 and a high of Rs 153.45 in trade today.
 
 
Angel Broking highlights five reasons why investors should subscribe to share sale:
 
 
Leadership position in project implementation
 
 EIL has developed indigenous technology and expertise for offshore platforms, oil & gas processing, oil refining, petrochemicals and pipeline projects over the last 48 years enabling it to provide a gamut of management services from project conception to commissioning in hydrocarbon business. EIL’s leadership in project implementation and long-term relationships with its clients gives it a competitive advantage over its peers.
 
 
Diversified operations across sectors and geographies
 
 Over the years, the company has diversified across various segments such as LNG, fertilizer, power, mining and metallurgy and infrastructure to encash the untapped infra opportunity not only in Indian but globally (presence in Middle East, Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia) as well and has an excellent track record of achieving the same. This will help the company to benefit from any recovery in the capex cycle both domestically and internationally.
 
 
Healthy order inflows over past couple of quarters
 
 The company has secured orders worth Rs 1,800 crore (up 39.5 % YoY) in 9MFY2014, taking the order backlog to Rs 3,820 crore, implying an order backlog to sales ratio of 2.1x on a trailing basis. This includes a major order worth $139 million bagged from Dangote Group in Nigeria for project management consultancy and EPC management.
 
 
Valuations
 
 At the lower and upper limit of the price-band of Rs 145 and Rs 150, the stock is currently trading at valuations of 8.4x and 8.7x FY2015E Bloomberg EPS respectively which is lower than its 3-year average PE of 14.8x.
 
 
Outlook
 
 Although the company has reported weak revenues in MFY2014, the improvement in order inflows indicates recovery in revenue going forward. Considering EIL’s dominance in the hydrocarbon business and attractive valuations, we recommend Subscribe on the stock.

The company's strong performance over the past several quarters and large order wins recently offer a healthy growth visibility for the mid-cap IT company. 
  
  Unlike some of the similar-sized industry rivals, Hexaware has been able to post a strong growth in its top line as well as bottom line over the past several quarters positioning itself amongst the most preferred IT mid-cap among the investors. Also, the company has been able to post a healthy recovery in its operating profit margin. 
  
  During the September 2011 quarter, Hexaware posted a nearly 10% revenue growth to 366 crore against the previous quarter, led by a robust volume growth of 9.2%. Operating profit margin has improved from single digit levels in the September 2010 quarter to 18.5% currently, 350 basis points up sequentially. Net profit has surged over 7% sequentially to 65 crore. 
  
  Hexaware has won six large deals in the past 18 months. While all the deals are in excess of $25 million, three are over $100 million. Cumulatively, these deals are worth over $600 million. This also includes $250-milion deal signed last month with the company's existing UK-based client, which is expected to add $60 million incremental sales over a period of five years starting from January 2012 onwards. 
  
  With net headcount addition of 745 during the September 2011 quarter, the company has exceeded its annual hiring target of 1,500 by 10% already. Moreover, operating at low attrition rate of 14.7% and with plans to hire 200 more people by the end of the current quarter, Hexaware reflects a strong deal pipeline going ahead. 
  
  With consistent growth momentum over the past several quarters, the company has revised the annual revenue guidance to 32% at $306 million. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Hexaware's focussed strategy has helped the company in stronger client mining and expanding footprints to newer geographies, including America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. 
  
  Also, increased spending in the enterprise services and banking, financial services and insurance verticals globally is likely to benefit the company going ahead. 
  
  While recent large deal wins will offer the momentum for revenue 
  
  growth, rupee depreciation in the past few months, offshore revenue shift, improved employee pyramid and better cost efficiencies are likely to be the key margin levers going ahead.

  IDFC is the foremost player in the infrastructure finance segment and we all are seeing a lot of seriousness by the government on infrastructure spending. Also with their recent infrastructure NBFC status, the company is now able to raise loans at much lower rates compared to before. So cost of funding has come down and given its size, we believe that it is in a position to grow loan book very substantially. This would itself rate the company to a target of around 300 or so in a year’s time. We also believe that there is a bonus upside in the form that they do hold equity in a lot of infrastructure projects within the country which they have financed over the last few years. As and when these come and they get returns on these, these would be bonus upsides on the counter."
"IFC doubles rupee bond offering to Rs 2,000 crore",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/ifc-doubles-rupee-bond-offering-to-rs-2000-crore/articleshow/28843829.cms,m.economictimes.com,"IFC doubles rupee bond offering to Rs 2,000 crore","NEW DELHI: International Finance Corp (IFC) has doubled its rupee bond offering in global markets, to Rs 2,000 crore, citing strong investor interest from developed economies, the private investment arm of the World Bank announced on Wednesday. 

 The first global rupee bond was issued in November last year, and is part of IFC's $1 billion(Rs 6,165 crore) global rupee bond program. 

 The transaction was upsized from Rs 300 crore in response to strong investor demand, according to a press statement released by the World Bank arm. Investors included asset managers, private banks, insurance companies, and central banks, in Asia, Europe and the U.S, the press release said. 

 According to data released by IFC, US-based investors have snapped up about 60% of the issue, followed by European and Asian investors, who have picked up 26% and 14% of the offering, respectively. Asset managers have been, by far, the largest investors to invest in the issue. 

 "" The strong market reception for the second IFC global rupee bond signals continued investor interest to rupee exposure,"" said Monish Mahurkar, director, IFC for Treasury Client Solutions. 

 Mahurkar also said that attracting foreign investment was key as the organisation continued to work with authorities to develop the rupee capital markets and provide an alternative source of rupee financing to stimulate foreign investment in India. 

 Priced on January 13 earlier this year, the bonds carry a coupon of 7.75%, with a maturity date of December 3. 2016. They will be listed either on the Singapore or Luxembourg exchanges, and are priced at about $161 million (Rs 992.7 crore), as per the latest currency exchange rates. 

 IFC global rupee bonds are denominated in Indian rupee but settled in U.S. dollars, with all principal and coupon payments tied to the U.S. dollar-rupee exchange rate. IFC converts bond proceeds from dollars into rupees on the domestic spot exchange market, and uses the rupees to invest in the country. 

 Over the years, IFC has issued bonds in 14 local currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi, the Nigeria naira, and the Russian ruble 

 India accounted for $4.5 billion (Rs 27,744.8 crore) of IFC's committed investment portfolio as of June 30, 2013-more than any other country. In the fiscal ended 2013 , IFC invested $1.38 billion (Rs 8.508.4 crore) in the country, to achieve several strategic priorities such as promoting inclusive growth in the country's low-income states, focusing on climate change, and supporting global economic integration. 

 JP Morgan and TD Securities acted as lead managers for the transaction."
Indian cashew exports to touch new high this fiscal,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/indian-cashew-exports-to-touch-new-high-this-fiscal/articleshow/32634009.cms,m.economictimes.com,Indian cashew exports to touch new high this fiscal,"KOCHI: Indian cashew exports have reached a new high of Rs4,624 crore, surpassing last year’s figure, with one more month to go in the fiscal 2014. 

 The possibility of exports touching Rs5,000 crore is not ruled out as the exporters could send more shipments in the last month. In 2012-13, cashew exports stood at Rs4,420 crore, which was the highest till now. The fall in rupee value during the year has helped in raising the total value of cashew exports. 

 Though the volumes have been down in certain months, the value has remained high. For instance in February 2014, the quantity of cashew export is lower by 12per cent at 7,009 tonne. However, the value is up by 6 per cent at Rs315 crore. 

 The total quantity, too, has almost reached the level in 2012-13 at 1,09,958 tonne at the end of February 2014. In the previous year the total quantity exported touched 1,10,306 tonne. 

 Higher exports have been achieved despite a 14per cent drop in raw cashew imports at 7,32,478 tonne till the end of February 2014. “Rising prices of raw cashew imported from Tanzania in the last few months have led to slowdown in processing, squeezing the export volumes. As a result many processing factories in Kerala have stopped working,’’ said P Somarajan, proprietor of Kailas Cashew Exports. The raw cashew price has eased after touching a high of over $1,400 per tonne. 

 The raw cashew from east African countries has been traditionally dearer than those from the west African regions, where the harvest has begun. “But this time the prices have been high at the start of the season at $1,150 per tonne. It has declined by $100 now, but is still high,’’ he added. India imports 8 to 9 lakh tonne of raw cashew every year. 

 While the raw nut price remains high, the cashew kernel price has been hovering in the range of $3.15 to 3.20 per pound, a factor which has been worrying the exporters. 

 “At the price we have been buying raw cashew, we should be getting a minimum of $3.40 per pound. But Indian exporters have been compelled to export at the above price, the rate at which Vietnam, the major supplier in the global market now, sells,’’ said Babu Oommen, proprietor of Alphonsa Cashew Industries. Some processors, who had stock of raw cashew nuts from the previous year with them made a killing by selling to other processors. Better domestic production at over 7 lakh tonne helped the exporters to tide over the lower imports to a certain extent."

ET Now: Both Just Dial and Info Edge are described as concept stocks. They both are expensive as well. But yet, both of them hold a lot of promise. What is your view on these stocks?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: It is disappointing to see that very few people have been able to part take in the great story. Info Edge has such a decent portfolio, with almost all category leaders — be it matrimony or the job portal side.
 
 
ET Now: They have real estate portal called 99acres as well.
 
 
Prakash Diwan: Real estate portfolio of the company took off way before others. The company has been able to match peers with very successful cost effective ad campaigns. So, the recall value has been tremendous, which is very important in e-commerce start ups. They are the only mature businesses in the portfolio.
 
 But, if you actually ask me, even today if somebody wants to buy these stocks, you are not buying something, which is a binary kind of investment, the one that would make either great money or actually make you lose money.
 
 Info Edge is still a great investment. As a disclaimer, I must say that we have this company as our client portfolio since fairly long time now. We believe that it continues to add value. With every news this the business is getting monetised.
 
 So, there is tremendous value and you can look at the kind of funding that could come in some of these businesses for the next five, six-seven years. It is not just like a one off thing like Zomato. You will have so much more to go for this."

  Do you expect investment is likely to come into the sugar counters?
   
  
  Avinash Gorakshekar: Yeah, at least in the shorter term, the flavour seems to have come back because there is going to be a supply constraint considering the Australia kind of issue but at least from a medium to longer term sense, it is very clear that we would like to know globally how the demand and supply scenario pans out because if India does not allow export of sugar, obviously most of the sugar players are waiting for the policy guidelines from the government. 
  
  The immediate reaction to yesterday’s global news has been quite positive and at least in the near term, we expect that even domestic prices of sugar would possibly firm up but to really put it in perspective whether these companies would actually make a decent mark up in their operating margins and how sustainable this price rise would be, it would be better to wait and watch at least for a quarter and then go ahead because this movement seems to be clearly market driven and most of the players have been quite apprehensive that this kind of global price rise as well as global development, the kind of benefit flow to Indian companies has not actually been pinpointed that clearly.
  
  
  From these levels if there is some positive that come out, can the fertiliser stocks go further from these levels?
   
  
  Avinash Gorakshekar: Typically at least agro stocks are definitely in limelight and if a policy directive comes out more favourably, especially for nutrient fertilisers and typically stocks, which are in the flavour like a Coromandel Fertiliser or may be a Chambal, I would suggest that probably these stocks would definitely get into the limelight because all said and done, we are expecting probably a good crop. 
  
  Incidentally just before the budget, the government would also like to ensure that some sort of subsidy kind of arrangement is also given out, so to that extent the outlook could turn positive because the industry has been awaiting this policy change for a long time, so last time the meeting was organised and nothing came out, so hopefully this time something concrete should come out to actually make the stocks actually move up.

Investor sentiment will turn in favour of Rupee: Chidambaram,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/investor-sentiment-will-turn-in-favour-of-rupee-chidambaram/articleshow/20860295.cms,m.economictimes.com,Investor sentiment will turn in favour of Rupee: Chidambaram,"NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over declining rupee, Finance Minister P Chidambaram today said the currency will find its level as steps being taken by the government to contain fiscal and current account deficits will improve investor sentiments. 

 ""We are committed to contain the fiscal deficit within the target and we are addressing how to finance the current account deficit. Sentiment will turn in favour of the rupee. I think rupee will find its level,"" he said in an interview with PTI here. 

 The rupee had touched historic low of 60.76 level against the dollar on June 26 due to heavy capital outflows amid fears of early withdrawal of US monetary stimulus. 

 Both the government and RBI have taken steps to contain gold imports, which is putting pressure on the CAD. Measures have been taken to enhance FII inflows in addition to easing norms for domestic companies to raise fund from abroad. 

 The Finance Minister, however added there is 'no good and bad value' that one could attach to the price of the rupee. 

 ""It's a price. Rupee is bought and sold. Dollars are bought and sold there is a price. It's also a function of supply and demand. It's also influenced by sentiment,"" he said. 

 Unfortunately, Chidambaram said, it is not only the sentiment of Indian buyers and sellers that matters in the forex market. 

 ""Even the sentiment of a lone gentleman (US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke) in the US impacts the rupee. And I have said Mr Bernanke statement is misunderstood or misinterpreted,"" he said. 

 Chidambaram said even in the US there are different views on the appropriateness of the Fed statement, it's timing and its content. 

 ""But I think once the true import of that statement sunk in... the rupee has recovered in the last few days. Even today rupee has recovered a bit,"" he added. 

 The rupee today rose by 10 paise to 59.29 against the dollar in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market on increased selling of the US currency by exporters. 

 Chidambaram also pointed out that high CAD, fiscal deficit and inflation have a depreciating impact on the rupee. 

 The Finance Minister said that all emerging economies -- including Mexico, Chile, South Africa and Turkey -- are running huge current account deficits. 

 India's CAD touched a record high of 4.8 per cent of the GDP in the 2012-13 financial year due to high imports, including that of gold. High CAD puts pressure on the value of the rupee."
Its time to take banking sector funds into account,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/its-time-to-take-banking-sector-funds-into-account/articleshow/35012026.cms,m.economictimes.com,It’s time to take banking sector funds into account,"Bank Nifty scaled a new peak on Friday. After underperforming the broad market for almost a year, banking sector funds have outperformed in the past three months after investors started betting on cyclical stocks. According to Value Research, a mutual fund tracking entity, banking sector funds as a category delivered 31.18% against 13.12 per cent given by CNX Nifty, in three months ended on May 9. 


	Suddenly, many stock market pundits are bullish on the sector in the medium- to longterm , as they feel the fundamentals will improve in the coming months. ""Indian economy is on the path of recovery and banking is best positioned to benefit in the process. Most banks reported better than estimated numbers for the last quarter, and the numbers on non performing assets was better than analyst estimates,"" says Jitendra Panda, MD & CEO, Peerless Securities. 


	He advises investors to put their money in actively-managed banking sector funds in a staggered manner. There are 13 mutual fund schemes dedicated to investing in banking stocks. These funds together manage around Rs 2,423 crore as on March 31. 


	""Banking sector has short-term issues such as non performing assets, but as the economy picks up, the sector is bound to do well,"" says Sunil Singhania, CIO-equity investments, Reliance Capital Asset Management. 


	However, advisors are asking investors to be measured in their approach. ""Diversified funds have 20-25 per cent of their investments in banking and financial sector stocks. So, an investor with exposure to diversified equity funds should restrict his investments in banking sector funds to the extent of 10 per cent of his entire equity portfolio,"" says Feroze Azeez, director — private wealth management, Anand Rathi Financial Services. 


	He recommends investing in Reliance Banking Fund through a systematic investment plan (SIP). However, identifying the right scheme to invest could prove a bit tricky for average investors. Though these schemes appear the same at first glance, they have varying investment mandates and it can make a big difference to their fortunes, say experts. For example, banking funds as acategory registered 4.43 per cent returns in the three years. 


	The best performing banking fund offered 12.62 per cent, while the worst performing banking fund lost 7.42 per cent. The large variance in returns is partly due to difference in their investment mandate. Passively-managed Kotak PSU bank ETF and Goldman Sachs PSU Bank BeES Fund lost money, as their investment mandate makes the fund manager mimic the PSU Banking index, which has been falling in last three years in a slowing economy. 

	

	In comparison, activelymanaged funds fared far better. PSU Index ETF from Kotak and Goldman Sachs lost 7.42 per cent and 7.05 per cent, actively ICICI Prudential Banking & Financial Services Fund gained 12.62% in three years. ""Actively-managed banking funds were invested in PSU banks two years ago, but they were quick to move to private sector banks, thus managing the risk well and generating outperformance for the investors,"" says Azeez. 


	 

	He prefers activelymanaged funds as they can align their portfolios with changing dynamics of the sector to generate outperformance to the benchmark. Banking sector has three components — public sector banks, private sector banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Mutual fund schemes have products that invest in one or all of these components. 


	For example , Goldman Sachs AMC has two different schemes that track CNX Bank Index and CNX PSU Bank Index. Reliance Mutual Fund also has two schemes — Reliance Banking Fund, which is an actively-managed banking sector fund and R*Shares Banking Exchange Traded Fund, which is an index fund that tracks CNX Bank Index. ""Investors keen on sector exposure without fund manger risk should invest in passively managed index funds, however those seeking outperformance should invest in actively-managed funds,” says Singhania. 


	Actively-managed funds with explicit mandate can invest in NBFCs and financial services companies, which index funds cannot, since the underlying index only accommodates stocks of commercial banks and not other financial services companies."

What we would want to believe is that the kind of margin expansion that happened in FY11 to the tune of about 11 odd per cent, that is very much possible in a scenario like this where crude, aviation turbine fuel has corrected by 43 per cent. In addition, if you look at the industry still not competing on prices, which is a very positive and encouraging trend from overall perspective, we believe that the margin expansion will be more than what we had earlier anticipated. Crude is still expected to stay low, which is where the trigger would come from. In addition to that, growth in passenger traffic has been quite good at about 19 per cent, which augurs well from an earnings perspective. This stock is still at a substantial discount compared to the market leader. So from that perspective, we believe that this stock has a lot more to catch up and that's why it is one of our top picks."

In June 2012 quarter, the company reported a robust 38% y-o-y growth in net profits. 

 In the quarter ending June 2012, JK Cement's revenues grew by 21% y-o-y to Rs 736 crore. This was mainly due to 15% growth in dispatch volumes and 5% increase in realization per ton. 

 However, on a sequential basis, dispatch volumes were lower by 11% in comparison to March 2012 quarter. The company was able to achieve higher volumes on y-o-y basis due to a weak monsoon that led to an increase in construction activity. 

 However, it would be difficult for the company to maintain the 7% growth in volumes in the coming quarters. For a pick up in demand, a lot would depend on the revival of infrastructure and real estate structure. One of the key triggers for the revival would be the softening of interest rates. 

 At current market price of Rs 232, the stock is trading at an Enterprise Value (EV) per ton of $65. This is in line with its similar sized peers, which are trading at an EV/ton of nearly $60."

On a standalone basis, however, the bank's net profit was up 28% to Rs 569 crore, but marginally below the Bloomberg poll of six analyst that expected the bank to post a net profit of Rs 586 crore. The performance of bank is not comparable with the corresponding quarter of last year since ING Vysya Bank was merger with Kotak Mahindra Bank from April 1, 2015. 

 Jaimin Bhatt, president and group CFO told ET that the integration of ING with Kotak will be completed by February 2016. ""The corporate loan book and treasury operations are integrated, the retail piece will be done by February,"" he said. 

 Provisions rose 237% to Rs 196 crore as its share of stress loans rose. On consolidated basis, gross non-performing assets more than doubled to Rs 2829 crore (Rs 1305 crore). After making provisions, the bank’s net NPA almost doubled to Rs 1257 crore. The bank had to reverse income of Rs 62 crore since one customer did not honour a derivative deal.

KV Kamath to map Infosys succession plan; stock rises,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/tech/software/kv-kamath-to-map-infosys-succession-plan-to-groom-managers-for-key-positions/articleshow/8138617.cms,m.economictimes.com,"KV Kamath to map Infosys succession plan, to groom managers for key positions","BANGALORE: Infosys, which on Saturday appointed KV Kamath as chairman in place of its iconic founder NR Narayana Murthy, will now draw up a succession plan for the eventual exit of all founders and the appointment of young professionals to run the company. 
  
  Kamath, whose tenure at ICICI Bank coincided with the appointment of many women professionals to important positions and who oversaw a similar succession at the bank during a troubled time in 2009, will help prepare such a plan, a person close to the development said. He will oversee the process of identifying and grooming people to fill important roles either at the board level or at the level of the management council, the software services firm’s next big decision-making body. 
  
  ET was the first to report that Kamath was the front-runner for Infosys chairman’s post in its edition dated August 16, 2010. 
  
  These managers could be given major responsibilities such as leading the company as the chief executive, becoming the COO or being appointed to similar senior roles at the board level, the person added. All this is expected to happen in the next five years and before the eventual retirement of Kamath from the company and that of the two founders — SD Shibulal and Kris Gopalakrishnan — from their executive roles. 
  
  “Forget charisma and clout, Infosys’ biggest transition is when founders are gone, and that’s why the company has picked Kamath, who has proven succession planning skills,” said another person familiar with the process behind this appointment. 
  
  Infosys has been dogged by controversy over succession as time neared for Murthy’s retirement from the company. He started the company in 1981 with money borrowed from his wife and is stepping down from all positions this year. So far, the company has followed the practice of allowing each of its major founder shareholders to take up the chief executive’s position.

  But this has had its share of problems. A senior Infosys director and a long-time Murthy confidante, TV Mohandas Pai, quit in a huff last month, saying the company should reward merit over seniority. 
  
  
  Murmurs of dissent at the Top management
  
  There were murmurs of dissent among the senior management cadre over being ignored for bigger roles. On Saturday, in a partial acknowledgement that the problem was serious, Infosys said it will consider appointing some senior managers to the board before the next shareholders meet in June. 
  
  ""Murthy is no mean planner - he was thinking at least five to seven years ahead when all founders would be gone and the board too will need new faces,"" said a person familiar with the decision-making at Infosys. ""Kamath has been brought in to create a structure that gives Infosys a self-perpetuating board and management, the way Tatas are running their companies,"" he added, requesting anonymity. 
  
  Kamath's skills at pushing growth and getting his managers to capture market share are well known and ICICI Bank grew to become one of India's biggest banks during his tenure. But in Infosys, Kamath faces a different set of challenges. The old guard is exiting and a new set of leaders has to be found and groomed for bigger responsibilities. The transition also has to be done without causing resentment among employees and management and uncertainty among shareholders. 
  
  
 
  In an exclusive chat with ET, Murthy also praised his skills in delegating responsibilities. Kamath has experience in managing succession. In 2009, just before he joined the Infosys board, Kamath helped ICICI Bank manage a successful leadership transition, passing on the baton to Chanda Kochhar. 
  
  ""Nobody has managed the transition from CEO to chairman as well as KVK has. He has made sure that Chanda was in the front seat. Was there to provide all advice, nicely, in a dignified manner. It is one of the finest examples,"" Murthy said in an interview. 
  
  ""At this point, the board feels that professionals who created and ran this company are slowly handing over the charge to a younger lot of people who will carry the baton for many more years,"" Kamath said in an interview. 
  
  ""In that process, there is a whole lot of handholding, mentoring, building of leadership talent, engagement of customer when required, in that process teaching the younger people, is required,"" Kamath added. Around a year ago, Cornell University professor Jeffrey Sean Lehman, an independent director on the Infosys board and chairman of the nominations committee, along with Deepak M Satwalekar and Kamath started a search for Murthy's replacement. A few months into the search, the committee started realising that Kamath's candidature could not be ruled out just because he's also on the nominations committee. 
  
  This was also the time when Infosys increased the retirement age for board members from 65 years to 70 years - a clear indication that Kamath was among the top candidates being considered for the post. 
  
  Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories""After he became a potential candidate, Kamath recused himself from the selection committee and the process,"" said Lehman. In August, Lehman had told ET that it's technically feasible for one of the nominations committee members to be considered for the chairman's post. 
  
  Some management experts and industry observers praised Infosys' transition plans saying it was done in an orderly manner. ""They are the first among major Indian companies to go through this transition,"" John McCarthy, senior vice-president and principal analyst, Forrester Research, said in a recent interview. ""It's always a challenge when you move the original management out. So far, they have done it in a transparent and orderly manner."" 
  
  ""Infosys needed an outsider. It had become too insider-involved and reached a plateau, they were running out of ideas for change. They needed a new sort of approach. This is where Kamath fits. He transformed ICICI from a sleepy organisation to the largest private sector bank when he left,"" a former ICICI Bank colleague said about Kamath. 
  
  Clearly, Kamath's stature as one of the top Indian corporate leaders helped him get the job, but can he become the door-opener Infosys has been missing ever since Nandan Nilekani quit in 2007? 
  
  ""Clearly, Infosys has gone for somebody who can help them do management transition and not necessarily open doors like Nandan did,"" a brokerage analyst in Mumbai said, requesting anonymity. Some analysts said Infosys could have looked at leaders at McKinsey, Citibank or even Pepsi for bringing a global, high-stature profile. 
  
  For instance, Nandan leveraged his equation with CEOs at customers such as BT, which until a few years ago was Infosys' top customer accounting for nearly $300 million in annual revenues. Over the past two years, rivals TCS and Wipro have successfully made inroads into BT and today earn more from the UK telecom operator than Infosys. 
  
  ""This is just a cosmetic change - from Kris to Shibu is not a big shift,"" said another analyst at a US-based brokerage firm. The reason behind such sentiment has to do with the intensely competitive nature of the IT industry. 
  
  Bigger rival TCS has been increasing its lead and fourth-placed Cognizant Technologies, snapping at Wipro's heels, has shown that it is a force to reckon with."
"Lakshmi Cotsyn to gain from capacity expansion, retail push",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lakshmi-cotsyn-to-gain-from-capacity-expansion-retail-push/articleshow/8378433.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Lakshmi Cotsyn to gain from capacity expansion, retail push","In the past six months, the stock of technical textile player Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn has fallen by 44% against the drop of 5% in the ET Textile index. But those investors in the company’s stock for the long term need not worry since the company’s fundamentals and outlook for the coming quarters look promising. 
  
  Increased focus in high-margin technical textile business and retailing would drive the company’s future growth. The company has undertaken expansion of capacities across its various segments, including technical fabric, denim, fusible interlining fabric and terry towels. 
  
  Through this expansion, the company will expand its technical textile capacity from six million meters to 64.5 million metres by September 2011. It plans to expand the terry towels capacity by five times to 15,000 tonne and double its fusible interlining and denim capacity to 12.5 million meters and 40 million meters, respectively. 
  
  Technical textile, as such, is a high-margin business segment of the textile sector. It caters to sectors such as construction, automobile, agriculture and medicine. 
  
  The scope and rate of growth in technical textile is higher than home and apparel textiles. Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn is a market leader in this segment and derives more than 32% of its total revenues from this business segment. Hence, the huge expansion of its technical textile (almost 16 times) stands in good stead for the company. The company is set to benefit from the doubling of its home furnishing and fabrics segments. 
  
  The fabrics segment includes denim, bottom weight, blended, quilted and embroidery and home furnishing includes terry towels and bed sheets. Both these segments, in all, contribute more than 28% to the company’s total revenues.Shri Lakshmi plans to open 1,500 multi-brands retail outlets on a franchise model in this fiscal. This, along with its rapid capacity expansion in denim and fabric segments, would improve realisations. 
  
  In the third quarter ending March 2011 (its fiscal ends in June), the company’s net profit increased by around 9% to Rs 27.7 crore on a year-on-year basis. Also, its net sales jumped by around 14.3% to Rs 437.8 crore. After witnessing a sharp fall in the past year’s June quarter, the company’s operating profitability is once again closer to the year-ago level of above 16%."

  What has been your portfolio strategy of late because last time when we interacted with you on this forum, your strategy was to buy defensives and you were clearly looking at buying large cap banks?
   
  We were already invested in large cap banks and as I had said while the near term looks like there could be some margin pressure, but given the opportunities over the long term and the fact that some of these banks have now focus on asset quality, we do not see significant risk in owning these banks, so therefore we said we would own some of the PSU as well as the private sector banks. Our strategy continues to be the same, we always look at valuations, taking into account certain long term assumptions, while there are lot of noise on a near term basis and it would start again now with the quarterly numbers coming out. We clearly look at the long term opportunities and normalise our numbers and with the valuations look attractive we would go ahead and invest. At this point if you look at our portfolio as of last month I think the Quantum Mutual Fund would have had cash of around 11% or 12% and that is what the fund managers indicated that they would use if the markets or valuations became more attractive."

Ashwani Gujral: Bata India was a day trading call and it has done well enough. If we have a couple of days' point of view, we can easily take profits. However, a long term breakout has happened above the 735-740 levels. We could expect another 250 points on the upside over the medium term in case the trend sustains. 

 So, levels of 1000 in the medium term are not unlikely. This stock has broken out after a long consolidation, which it has done all the way from August 2011. So, breaking out of a six-month consolidation on very good volume is always positive. This shows that any consumption, globally or locally is likely to get into the next leg of the rally."

ET Now: What is your view on IT at large and Tech Mahindra specifically which came out with a splendid set of numbers?
 
 
Anand Tandon: The earnings of IT companies were largely in line with expectations but what has happened is that they have expanded thier PE.
 
 Overall, if you look with long term perspective, IT is the place to be. It also stands to gain from further rupee depreciation. Tech Mahindra has re-rated a lot but given its current set of numbers, you will probably get another 10% from here easily.
 
 
ET Now: What is it that you are advising your clients at this juncture - any stock idea that one could look at from the large cap universe? 

 
Hemang Jani: From the large cap space, one can definitely look at some of the private sector banks like ICICI Bank, Federal Bank and Axis Bank, which have corrected about 5% to 7% in the past few trading sessions, where the numbers have been by and large good. We think that, overall though there might be volatility around that space, an upside potential is about 20-25% from current levels."

It has posted a consolidated revenue growth of 21%, the highest over the past three quarters, owing to the launch of its limited competition generic products in the United States and favourable currency movement. 

 The operating margin of 26% is also the highest since the beginning of the financial year. At Rs 476 crore, the company’s net profit is double than that in the corresponding quarter two years ago. 

 
  The company’s generics business in the US benefited from the launch of limited competition products, including Tricor, Trizivir and Cymbalta. However, the branded business, which has four main products, suffered a slowdown in the US and remains a matter of concern. With most of the trade-related issues pertaining to the new drug pricing policy getting settled, the company’s domestic business recovered smartly and posted a 14% growth in revenues – higher than the industry’s single-digit growth. 

 Revenues from the Japanese business were dented on account of currency depreciation and negative performance of its subsidiary Irom. In a short span of two years, Lupin has emerged as one of the most promising pharma stocks. It is now the second most valuable pharma company on the bourses."

NSE's stock option strategy pays off as volumes soar,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/nses-stock-option-strategy-pays-off-as-volumes-soar/articleshow/19586028.cms,m.economictimes.com,NSE's stock option strategy pays off as volumes soar,"MUMBAI: Stock option volumes in the market are up with the country's leading bourse, National Stock Exchange, trying out a new strategy to attract investors. 

 Since April 1, the exchange has reduced the strike price interval for stock options -- a move that has given more investors greater opportunities to trade. 

 ""It's like introducing a new station in a railway route... so, more people can get into the train,"" said a broker. 

 The average daily stock option trading volumes in April has been Rs 11,900 crore so far as against Rs 9,738 crore in February and Rs 9,564 crore in March. These numbers are arrived by multiplying the stock price with number of contracts traded. 

 Thus, the higher number for January (at Rs 12,982 crore) was primarily because of to higher stock prices then. NSE's benchmark Nifty index was hovering between 5,800 and 6,1000 in January while it touched a low of 5,500 in April. 

 Simply put, if the strike price available in the L&T call and put was earlier at an interval of Rs 50, the NSE has now reduced this to Rs 20. So, if traders could take position in call and put options of L&T at Rs 1,350-1,400-1,450 at an interval of 50 points, the new rule enables them to also take positions at Rs 1380-1400-1420 and further, at intervals of 20. 

 ""The new strike price rule will definitely bring incremental liquidity in stock options segment in a sustained manner,"" said Siddharth Bhamre, head of derivative at the Mumbai-based Angel Broking. 

 According to Sundararaman R, senior vice-president and head of new products at NSE, the new strike price is contributing 32% of trading volumes in L&T, 42% in ICICI Bank and 33% in Tata Motors, which are among the most liquid stock options traded on NSE. 

 
  ""Overall, the newly introduced strike price is contributing 25% to the total stock option volumes on NSE... The correct way to see rise in interest due to change in rule is to consider volumes in the newly introduced strike price, which is up significantly,"" he said. 

 NSE has said that it could also include yet another strike price between the previous strike prices on an intra-day basis depending on market conditions. Market experts say it is like providing a constant supply of instruments to woo traders from rival bourses. 

 ""As premiums and liquidity are lower in far out-of-money stock options, preference is to trade in at-the-money or in-the-money options, thus paying higher premiums. Now with the availability of new strikes, positions can be created with lower premiums,"" said a ICICI Direct note to clients. 

 ""You can now take a higher number of lots in near-the-money options with the same funds as compared to ATM/ITM options previously,"" the note said. 

 This is NSE's second attempt to make the segment more attractive. In 2010, the exchange switched from American to European style stock options to counter BSE's delivery-based settlement. European stock options are only exercisable on the expiry date, cutting the overnight volatility risk in the underlying asset for sellers. American-style stock options are exercisable any time before the expiry date."

ONGC biggest beneficiary from diesel subsidy cut: Anish Damania,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/ongc-biggest-beneficiary-from-diesel-subsidy-cut-anish-damania/articleshow/41413645.cms,m.economictimes.com,ONGC biggest beneficiary from diesel subsidy cut: Anish Damania,"In a chat with ET Now, Anish Damania, Head-Institutional Equities, IDFC Securities, shares his view on the oil and gas sector. 
 
 
ET Now: Interesting moves when it comes to the oil and gas pack. One of course the crude cool off benefiting and secondly, it seems like there is going to be a decisive decision this time around on the gas pricing too. What is the sense that you are getting about the demand one is seeing of late for names like an ONGC or for that matter even Reliance, also the entire OMC basket?
 
 
Anish Damania: So petrol prices have already been in line with the market prices. So as the crude prices have fallen from a high of about $113-114 to $102, there is a correction even in the petrol prices which have been coming up. So we have seen two cuts in petrol prices come up. Diesel on the other hand continued to be subsidies. So they want to bridge that gap as much as possible.
 
 So this allows them to bridge that gap quicker than expectations. So the increase in diesel price is also good because that reduced the subsidy and as far as ONGC is concerned, they would be the major gainers of any cut in subsidy because they will have to bear that much less burden. So if one were to look at that, then ONGC is the biggest gainer in this. As far as Reliance is concerned, Reliance is more a function of how the GRMs are behaving and how the differential between crude and light crude is behaving. the more the difference the better is the outlook for Reliance.
 
 So at this point of time, Reliance till the time gas pricing is decided, we will see that trade about current levels or little bit higher. But in case of ONGC, definitely subsidies are falling. So they are the major beneficiaries there and that story continues and if gas pricing comes up, that will be an added benefit to ONGC."

In another interaction with top B-school students, he said in the next 10 years, at least three Indian pharma companies will become global players with innovative drugs in all the markets. While valuations — price-to-earnings multiple of some of the pharma companies may appear expensive, optimists would focus on the earnings growth estimate of the top 10 for the next two years. (See table)
 
 
 The pharma index has outperformed most other cyclical sector indices and the CNX Pharma index has gained 73% in the past year against 29% gains of the CNX Nifty. Companies mentioned in the table have been consistently meeting their earnings expectations and chances are they would continue to do so over the next few years. According to Bloomberg data, earnings estimates of these top 10 companies are likely to grow in the range of 17% to 68% CAGR over the next two years, and are available at FY17 earnings multiple of 15 to 26. Amid uncertainty over capex and loan growth taking off and the valuation and earnings mismatch of several cyclical companies, it would not come as a surprise if investors prefer pharma stocks."
Play realty by buying housing finance companies: Anand Tandon,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/play-realty-by-buying-housing-finance-companies-anand-tandon/articleshow/43238087.cms,m.economictimes.com,Play realty by buying housing finance companies: ​Anand Tandon,"In a chat with ET Now, Anand Tandon, Independent Analyst, shares his views on real estate. Excerpts:  ET Now: Do you see areas of value in real estate or is it all avoid for now?  Anand Tandon: No. Other than HDFC, which is obviously the most expensive of the lot, some of the others are reasonably priced. My own favourite would be LIC Housing where the institutional backing ensures that you have no issue in terms of capital and the growth will be reasonable without being flashy.  valuations are also relatively cheap. Rather than playing real estate, there is no question in my mind that the better way to play that sector is to buy it through the housing finance companies.  	ET Now: Sharda Cropchem has had a good listing, a lot of people have applied to it as well, do you have an opinion here?  	Anand Tandon: There is an interesting business model there where you are basically trying to focus on getting the registrations and then completely outsourcing the material. The simple question is that what is the risk that supply chain will not collapse?  	We have a situation in this country today where a large part of the pharma industry is actually determined, also dependent on China and a similar problem arises there as well. So while on the face of it, it looks like business which has very high protection as well as very high margins and consequently ROEs.  	To my mind, the risk is also fairly significant because they do not necessarily have their own technology or the ability to find a replacement for the stock that they are buying from China. So it is a high risk venture. The numbers will probably still justify themselves for a while but with the kind of upside that it has already seen, I would be a little hesitant at these prices. "

  The firm has roped in around 20 anchor investors like Blackstone, Artha Capital, Mirae Assets Global Investment (India), Blackrock, Sundaram BNP Paribas Mutual Fund and Reliance Capital. The company plans to allocate 10% of the issue to anchor investors.
  
  “There is substantial demand from anchor investors who want to take larger exposure in the company,” said Venkat K Narayana, CFO, Prestige Estates.
  
  Anchor investors are the funds that buy a large chunk of shares a day before an IPO opens, helping in determining an approximate benchmark price for share sales. The realty firm plans to sell the shares within the price band of 172-183. 
  
  The pre-IPO valuation of Prestige Estates is 4,515-4,800 crore, while the post-IPO valuation is expected to be 5,900 crore at the upper-side of the price band. For the issue, Prestige has appointed Enam Securities, UBS, JP Morgan and Kotak Mahindra Capital as its book-running lead managers. Shares offered through the IPO are proposed to be listed on the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The realty major would be diluting 20% stake in the company. Post IPO, Prestige’s promoter holding will drop to around 80%. Irfan Razack, Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack are its three co-promoters.
  
  The Prestige IPO will open on October 12 and close on October 14. Prestige aims to use the fund from the IPO for existing projects and new launches across verticals in addition to paying back debt.
  
  “We will use 15-20% of IPO proceeds to repay debt, 65% to invest in ongoing projects and the remainder as working capital,” said Mr Narayana.
  
  As of June 2010, Prestige had a consolidated net debt of 1,700 crore. For the year ended March 2010, the company had a total income of 1,086 crore."

The Australian dollar gained and Asian stocks fell ahead of data economists project will show China’s economy slowed in the second quarter.
 
 Gold climbed 0.2% to $1,288.02 an ounce by 10:20 am in Tokyo, as palladium headed for a one-month high. The so-called Aussie strengthened 0.2% after sliding to the weakest level since August 2010 July 12. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index excluding Japan index fell 0.2%, with markets in Tokyo closed for a holiday. Futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 0.1% after the gauge reached a record July 12. Crude dropped 0.4% and corn futures sank.
 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S Bernanke said last week that the US would need very accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future, bolstering gold's allure as a store of value. China’s economy, the world’s second-largest, expanded 7.5% in the three months to June 30, according to the median of 45 estimates before data due on Monday, after growth slowed to 7.7% in the first quarter. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said July 12 that growth in 2013 may be below target, comments later corrected by the official Xinhua News Agency.
 
 “The continuing theme for gold and metals in general is Bernanke indicating a more accommodative monetary stance,” Gavin Wendt, founder of Mine Life, a mining and resources researcher in Sydney, said by phone. “China can't really grow at 9 to 10% every year. Growth now is coming off a very high base, but it’s more sustainable.”
 
 Hedge funds raised bets on higher gold prices for a second week as Bernanke’s comments damped expectations stimulus will be cut soon. Net long positions on the metal rose by 4.1%, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for July 9 showed. Gold surged 5.1% last week.
 
 “Bernanke’s comments put some positive feeling back into gold and into all commodities,” said Dan Denbow, a fund manager at the $1 billion USAA Precious Metals & Minerals Fund in San Antonio. “The Fed has been working hard to show that taking back a little bit of bond buying isn't removing accommodation, and Bernanke was very firm on that. There was a bit of a sentiment shift.”
 
 Silver rose 0.3%, while palladium gained 0.6%, poised for the highest close since June 14. Platinum climbed 0.3%, set for the highest close since June 19. Zinc, nickel, aluminum and lead for three-month delivery fell on the London Metal Exchange, as tin rose 0.3%. Copper futures lost 0.5%."

Tur (Arhar) dal prices have gained by about 25 per cent since June 2022 while, urad prices have surged by about 21 per cent during the same period in main mandis, and prices of moong have upped by about 13 per cent.

Chana, which is the key pulse crop in India and is cultivated in the Rabi season, remained supported during the same period due to a rally in the Kharif pulses but higher supplies of chana will keep the prices sideways over the medium-term.

Looking forward, due to the onset of Kharif crops' arrival, prices are likely to remain steady during October-December 2022 quarter, as we witnessed during most of September 2022, wherein prices capped 2 per cent range. Now, much will depend on Rabi Crop Planting’s intention, especially for China

Whether farmers will opt for more area amid a huge pileup of carryover stocks or shift area to other remunerative crops will drive the sentiment to some extent but nothing will change the outlook of Chana until we have clarity about crop progress in the Rabi season.


A look at the stock position and procurement:
Chana stocks with NAFED are around 30.5 Lakh MT, of which 15 Lakh MT will go into the buffer for states. Chana procurement by NAFED: Chana procurement stood at 25.92 Lakh MT. The state-wise breakup is as follows - Maharashtra 7.60 Lakh MT, Gujarat 5.59 Lakh MT, Madhya Pradesh 8.02 Lakh MT, Karnataka 74 KMT, Andhra Pradesh 72 KMT, Rajasthan 2.99 Lakh MT and Uttar Pradesh 26.45 KMT.

The procurement program is completed across all the above-mentioned states. Government Chana procurement target for 2022-23 is 29 Lakh MT, against which 25.92 Lakh MT procurement is completed, reaching 89 per cent of the target. In Maharashtra, procurement reached 98 per cent of the target, in Gujarat 104 per cent, in Madhya Pradesh 92 per cent, and in Rajasthan 50 per cent. 


Origo pulses crop production estimate (for the crop year 2022-23)
Tur production for 2022-23 is estimated to drop 4.64 per cent YoY at 3.66 MMT against 3.84 MMT in 2021-22. Tur acreage is down by 4.78 per cent YoY while yield is estimated flattish from the last year.

State-wise production breakup

Maharashtra's production is projected to be lower by 12.89 per cent YoY at 1.02 MMT and Karnataka is seen down by 8.08% at 0.86 MMT while production would increase in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Urad production for 2022-23 is estimated to fall by 7.92 per cent YoY at 1.60 MMT against 1.74 MMT in 2021-22. Urad acreage is down by 6.27 per cent YoY while yield is estimated to drop by 1.77 from the last year. There is more downside risk to the urad crop as rains affected the yield in Madhya Pradesh.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC; stock gains over 6%,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rakesh-jhunjhunwala-bullish-on-ncc-stock-gains-over-6/articleshow/45144791.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC; stock gains over 6%,"MUMBAI: NCC, a Hyderabadbased engineering and construction firm, has been under the spotlight on Dalal Street of late as investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has been raising its stake in the company in recent quarters. Jhunjhunwala, known to have a following in the market, increased his stake in NCC recently through the open market and by subscribing to the rights issue.
 
 The stock surged as much as 6.89 per cent in intra day trade on Friday and hit an all-day high of 61.25 and a low of 58.10 on the BSE.
 
 He has acquired four crore shares by subscribing to the rights issue and bought 6.5 lakh shares through the open market on October 31. He held 11.85% stake as on September 30, 2014 and with this purchase, his stake has risen to 12.78%.
 
 So, what makes Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC?
 
 Analysts believe the investor could be betting on a turnaround in the company as the rights share issue and sale of assets could cut debt. “We see an improved growth prospects for NCC with better liquidity and lower debt burden post completion of its rights issue,” said Ashish Shah, analyst, IDFC Securities.
 
 
  
 
 ""With a leaner balance sheet and negligible capital commitment towards its asset portfolio, we expect traction in NCC’s core EPC business.""
 
 NCC has risen by 33% in the last one month and 178% so far this year against ET Construction index’s gain of 13% and 47%, respectively, during the same period. Private equity firm Blackstone held 9.9%stake in NCC as on September 30.
 
 ""NCC has multiple triggers waiting in the wings, which can lead to significant cash accrual and expect robust growth in the order book over the next two years,"" said Vibhor Singhal, analyst at Phillip Capital.
 
 NCC’s Rs 600-crore rights issue has been subscribed by 1.14 times last month. The proceeds from this issue will be used for repayment of its term loans and NCDs, which stand at about Rs 600 crore currently on a standalone basis. The borrowing cost of these loans ranges from 10-15% with the weighted average borrowing cost of about 13%. With these loans now proposed to be repaid, it is expected to result in interest savings of at least Rs 60 crore for the company.
 
 Post the proposed rights issue, NCC’s debt-to-equity ratio on a standalone basis will reduce to 0.6 from 1. On a consolidated basis, it will fall to 1 from 1.4."

Rate cut hopes make traders bullish on Bank Nifty,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bank-nifty-futures-shatter-traders-hopes/articleshow/46901495.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bank Nifty futures shatter traders’ hopes,"MUMBAI: Many affluent and retail traders have been caught on the wrong foot on their recent equity derivative bets. These market participants are staring at steep losses in their positions in bank index futures contracts following the slide in these shares in the last one month.
 
 For many on Dalal Street, the words loss and risk have been forgotten concepts in the last one year or so. So, when high net-worth and retail traders took sizeable bullish bets on banks early in March, as the index hovered around record levels, few expected the upward momentum to reverse. Now, a month later, with the Bank Nifty still almost 6% below its peak, traders are wondering whether to stay put or book losses. They had built long positions in Bank Nifty futures in the March series when the index was around 19,800-20,000 on expectations the Reserve Bank of India would continue to ease monetary policy, even after surprising the market with two rate cuts this year. The Bank Nifty closed at 18,800.85 on Friday.
 
 “Traders were anticipating that the RBI would continue to cut rates and that Bank Nifty would move from strength to strength. There are many who are stuck,” said Siddarth Bhamre, head — derivatives and technical research, Angel Broking. The slide in Bank Nifty in line with the broader market started in the first week of March but traders stuck to their positions on hopes the index would rebound soon. They rolled over their bets to the April futures and options series on hopes that the markets, including bank shares, would rebound, helping them minimise losses or even eke out small profits. The Bank Nifty bounced back to almost 19,000 levels but has been unable to cross that level.
 
 “Some of the clients have booked losses but several others are hanging in there. They will wait some more time because there is a feeling that the downside is limited,” said the head of the high net-worth desk at a retail brokerage. “They will decide whether to roll over based on the rollover cost.” Fund managers say the fourthquarter results would be the next trigger for banks though a lot of the pessimism over earnings disappointment has been discounted. “Banks will find it difficult to move up in a big way from the current levels because results may not have anything in them and there are no triggers especially on the economy front,” said V Balasubramanian, senior fund manager at IDBI Mutual Fund.
 
 Analysts do not expect the Bank Nifty to cross 19,500 in the near term, unless the benchmark indices move up sharply. “Unless the Nifty does not see sharp upsides, we are not seeing much of a rally in the Bank Nifty,” added Bhamre."
Rate hike hints from RBI push bond prices up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/rate-hike-hints-from-rbi-push-bond-prices-up/articleshow/6060821.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rate hike hints from RBI push bond prices up,"Bond yields came off one week lows on Thursday after top policymakers said they were concerned about soaring prices, raising the possibility of an off-cycle rate hike by the central bank. 
  
  The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond ended at 7.64%, off the day’s low of 7.54%, its lowest since June 10. It had ended at 7.59% on Wednesday. Volumes were heavy at Rs 16,675 crore ($3.6 billion) on RBI’s trading platform. 
  
  India plans to buy back Rs 10,000 crore of bonds via a multiple price auction on June 18, RBI said on Wednesday. An expected outflow of over Rs 136 lakh crore between late May and June toward third-generation (3G) spectrum auction payments, advance taxes and broadband auction payments has tightened liquidity with banks and sent cash rates higher. 
  
  However, hawkish comments from top policymakers have investors see a greater chance of an early interest rate hike despite a slight easing in food and fuel price inflation. 
  
  India’s inflation rate has reached uncomfortable levels and some, action from the central bank, is needed to curb demand-side pressures, C Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council said on Thursday. 
  
  Also, on Thursday, RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty said domestic inflation was a bigger concern than other global factors. 
  
  The one-year rate fell in the morning on hopes the buyback will ease the tight cash conditions but the policymakers’ comments pushed it higher. The rate was at 5.50%, up from an intra-day low of 5.31% and up from Wednesday’s close of 5.41%. The five-year rate that closely followed federal bond yields on Thursday, was at 6.87%, 2 basis points above its previous close. It hit a low of 6.77% in the morning. The government is also due to sell Rs 11,000 crore of bonds on Friday. 
  
  In interest rate futures market on NSE, with the 10-year benchmark paper as the underlying, the June contract implied an yield of 7.8782% while the September contract was not traded."

  In a chat with ET Now, Gajendra Nagpal, CEO, Unicon Financial Solutions, shares his views on the outlook of KRBL.
  
  
  Do you see KRBL, an exporter of basmati rice, benefiting from the increase in rice rices?
   
  Yes. The company seems like benefiting greatly from the price rise. Since there has been a significant crop failure in Pakistan, the realisation has become very high. Apart from that, the company has undertaken a strong expansion programme. It looks like the company is well positioned to take advantage of the export boom and the scarcity of rice production that happened because of some of the geographical factors. So, my call obviously is to recommend a buy on this counter.

ET Now: Let me paint the picture for largecap IT firms. Infosys gives hopes, TCS offers consistency, Wipro has got attractive valuations and HCL Tech — even as it has come up with subpar numbers — is cheap. What is you view on largecap IT space?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: There is an underlying hope in all IT stocks. Wipro is looking better because it is probably the cheapest out of the IT lot. One can hope that whatever changes they are talking about finally delivers.
 
 
ET Now: But they have been talking about it from last three years. Isn’t it?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: But others are also talking about changes. Infosys for that matter is very sounding and convincing that they have a few may be innovative plans, new product launches and new themes that could drive the future growth. But these are all driven by how the management is guiding.
 
 We have not yet seen the managements turning extremely optimistic and nobody has been going overboard. Even if you look at TCS’ management, the body language shows that they are fairly cautious.
 
 They may be of view that things may not be as bad as we thought. This could be the right time to get into these IT names as the valuation will otherwise get stretched again. Right now, Infosys and Wipro probably are…TCS of course is a different.
 
 TCS always prevails in a band where you have to accept premium valuations. Cloud is going to be the next big wave so anybody who is…

  In this sort of a market, it becomes very difficult what you can accumulate but clearly it is not declining. Whenever the markets are coming down or it’s basically holding onto 680-700, so chances are that it will at least keep you safe if nothing else but clearly upside will need the stock getting past 760-765. 
  
  That will probably happen only once the market stabilises on the large caps, only then somebody will look at Bajaj Holdings but it seems that the stock is forming some kind of a base and it is reasonably safe to buy it here.

 Of the targeted pipeline, four projects have already been awarded this financial year while nine others with a total project cost of Rs 23,000 crore have been identified for bidding in the next six to eight months.
 
 ""We expect uptick in tender pipeline from traffic-based competitive bidding project (TBCB) with 8-10 projects lined up for bidding over next six to eight months. Companies in the transmission & distribution segment also share optimistic view on the order pipeline. The commentary suggests this segment is likely to see a significant improvement in outlook, given the large pipeline of tenders expected from PowerGrid (PWG), SEBs and TBCB orders over the next 18-24 months. Our preferred picks in the T&D segment are KEC (accumulate), Kalpataru Power (accumulate) and Techno Electric (not rated) in the EPC space and Alstom T&D (not rated) in equipment space,"" brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report.
 
 Around Rs 14,100 crore worth of transmission projects were awarded through tariff-based bidding in 2014-15. Overall, at the central level, 26 projects have been bid out so far. Our interaction with PWG and various companies suggests a possibility of Rs 80,000 crore - Rs 1,00,000 crore bid between PWG, TCBC and SEBs over the next 18-24 months.
 
 ""On a thumb rule basis, 55-60 per cent of ordering is likely for transmission lines, where KEC, Kalpataru, L&T and Tata Projects will be the key beneficiaries and 40-45 per cent ordering will be for sub-stations and equipment like transformers/reactors/insulators/conductors, HVDC and new technology products like SVC/STATCOM, where the key beneficiaries would be ABB, SIEMENS and Alstom. Ordering is also increasingly dominated by high-technology products (765kv/HVDC/GIS, SVCs etc.),"" the brokerage said.
 
 In line with the government’s ‘Make in India’ programme, PWG has focused on improving domestic manufacturing in various products (765 Kv transformers/reactors, 765 Kv GIS equipment, 800KV HVDC equipment, SVC/STATCOM, conductor/insulator/EHV cable) by making domestic manufacturing facility necessary for most of the products. ""This will create a level-playing field for companies like ABB, Siemens and Alstom T&D, who already have manufacturing facilities in India,"" the report said."

Sensex@record high: How to play the market from here,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-nifty-near-record-highs-heres-what-should-investors-do/articleshow/93614415.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sensex, Nifty near record highs. Here's what should investors do","It was expected to be a bear market rally, a short-term relief. While the jury is out, the ongoing rally has lasted longer, much to Dalal Street's surprise. Valuations are again looking expensive and technical charts are sending overbought readings, and yet the market is not cautious, as the narrative has changed on inflation, even as the Fed has shown no sign of going soft.

The reason why this leg of the rally has lasted longer is the cooling of inflation, expectations of central banks taking a measured approach to inflation and growth, and, at home, the fact that consensus earnings, which were supposed to be badly hit in June quarter due to full-scale impact of inflation, has seen only a 2.7 per cent downgrade this earnings season.

Profits for Nifty50 firms have risen 23 per cent YoY in the June quarter, led by the BFSI sector. Excluding BFSI, profit grew 18 per cent YoY for Nifty50 firms. This is even as companies such as Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, SBI, HDFC and BPCL posted weaker-than-expected results.

Add to that the comeback of foreign investors, who have bought shares worth Rs 22,453 crore in August so far.

""Risk appetite globally has increased and a lot of money is moving to equities. Investors have faith that central banks and governments globally will tackle macro issues relating to inflation and growth well. Corrections have been small in terms of value and time and fresh buyings are happening every fall,"" said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities.

Jasani said economies globally may or may not do well, but large corporations may keep growing.

""If you are overweight on equities, it may be the time to sell on rallies and re-enter on dips. If you are underweight, keep accumulating gradually. But if you are equal-weight, wait for dips to add stocks,"" Jasani said.

At the day's high of 60,238.70, the BSE Sensex has rallied 9,317.48 points or 18.3 per cent over its 52-week low of 50921.22 hit on July 17.

It is a case of history repeating itself, said Rahul Shah, Co-Head of Research at Equitymaster.

""Whenever the Sensex has not entered a bear market, the reversal has been quite quick historically and the same has happened this time also. The icing on the cake is that, unlike last time, valuations are much more reasonable this time around. Although the broader market is by no means cheap, it isn't prohibitively expensive either,"" Shah said.

Shah said investors looking for fundamentally strong stocks at attractive valuations could still find pockets of undervaluation.

That said, Niteen Dharmawat, Co-Founder, Aurum Capital, said one should not expect similar kinds of returns that the market has given in the last couple of weeks.

""We will have to curtail our return expectations because we already have seen a significant amount of rally,"" he said.

Kenneth Andrade, Old Bridge Capital said whatever is happening, it is unexpected because India had two great years leading up to 2022 and a correction was more or less expected in this cycle.

""We are trading fairly where we left off at the beginning of the year. That is how I think the market will move over the next couple of quarters. I mean the data points are quite simple; they are very macro-linked. We have to see how central banks globally address all of what is happening out there,"" he said.

Stable demand for housing loan to drive HDFC growth,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/stable-demand-for-housing-loan-to-drive-hdfc-growth/articleshow/5482768.cms,m.economictimes.com,Stable demand for housing loan to drive HDFC growth,"India's largest mortgage finance company, HDFC, continued with its strategy of improving asset quality and converting more approvals into disbursements in the quarter to December 2009. Gross non-performing assets or bad loans were marginally lower at 0.94% of portfolio at the end of the December quarter compared to 1.01% in the year ago period. That a revival is ahead seems to be reflected in more loan approvals getting converted into disbursements. HDFC converted as much as 88% of approvals into disbursements in the December 2009 quarter. Indeed, the tide had turned in the quarter to September 2009, when 85% of approvals were converted into disbursements. Prior to that borrower interest was lukewarm given the extent of the slowdown and with relatively higher interest rates. Disbursements formed 81% of approvals in FY09. With a y-o-y growth of 18%, HDFC’s loan book grew at the same pace in the December 2009 quarter as in the previous quarter. Its disbursals aggregated Rs 11,185 crore during the third quarter after plunging to Rs 8,688 crore in the June 2009 quarter. Clearly, there has been a recovery for HDFC after its profit fell by 15% in the previous fiscal due to high interest rates and sluggish loan demand. With the improvement in spread and growth in loan book, profits grew 23% in December 2009. Its spread also improved at 2.36% in the quarter to Dec ember compared to 2.2% in the September 2009 quarter. Meanwhile, profits for the December 2009 quarter included profits on sale of investment, which was a one-off item. Excluding this one-off item, profit growth was 16%. HDFC has moderated its expenses, with its wage bill and other operating expenses remaining more or less flat on a y-o-y basis. This has helped it to maintain profit growth, at a time when the asset book is not growing at the heady pace which it recorded in the past.HDFC should be able to maintain its spread in the coming quarters, considering the easy liquidity conditions. Considering that interest rates are expected to be stable, at least in the near term and with a rebound in growth, demand for housing loans could remain roughly at the same level as seen in the past six months. It is quite likely that HDFC would post a profit growth in double digits, going forward."

India's largest truck and bus maker posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,274 crore for the fiscal year ended March, compared with Rs 2,571 crore a year ago. The rise in profit was largely driven by the near Rs 7,700 crore (£1.04 billion) net profitability of its JLR unit, which was initially loss making, but has turned around in the last few quarters. 
  
  ""The improved profitability was driven by higher volumes and pricing of these (JLR) products across various markets,"" chief financial officer C Ramakrishnan told reporters. The company's net profit from domestic operations, however, dropped 19% to 1,812 crore, compared with Rs 2,240 crore in 2009-10. An analyst tracking Tata Motors said high commodity prices and lower sales could check profitability of the company, and the auto sector in general. 
  
  Tata Motors, part of the salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, builds utility vehicles, cars and the ultra-cheap Nano. It acquired Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor in 2008 for $2.3 billion. JLR's global sales volume for the year rose 26% to 2.43 lakh units, helped by improved market conditions, better market mix and strong demand from China, which has emerged as one of the strongest markets for the brand. 
  
  The company's global sales for the year rose 24% to 10.80 lakh vehicles, backed by its wide product portfolio. Consolidated revenue rose by a third to Rs 1.23 lakh crore. In the domestic market, sales of Tata's passenger vehicles, including Fiat and JLR vehicles distributed in India, grew 23% year-on-year to 3.19 lakh units, helped by rising personal incomes and easier finance. In the commercial vehicles segment, its sales jumped 22.7% year-on-year to 458,828 units, mainly because of improved infrastructure. In India, the demand for cars is expected to moderate because of higher fuel costs and interest rates, with growth pegged at 12 -15% for this fiscal year. It was 30% last year. 
  
  Rising raw materials prices had forced Indian car makers, including Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki, to raise prices in recent months. Tata Motors' shares closed up 2.5% at Rs 1,162.40 on BSE, ahead of the results."

 Top rated Rural Electrification Corporation's tax free bond issue was on Monday oversubscribed four times from its total issue size. This issuer, however offered rates less than what Power Finance Corporation and NTPC had offered a few weeks ago as the Reserve Bank of India slashed the borrowing cost more than what it was estimated.
 
 The company collected a total of around Rs 2,800 crore versus Rs 700 crore, the total issue. The REC bonds offer retail investors as much as 7.43 per cent for a 20-year maturity, 7.14 per cent and 7.34 per cent with 10- and 15-year maturities, respectively, which are also higher than similar-maturity secondary market yields.
 
 Tax free bond prices are linked to the benchmark bond yields, which move following RBI rate actions.

""Retail investors has seen this issue as an opportunity to earn higher rate over a long period,"" Out of total investors more than 47 per cent were retail. They rush for longer maturities.
 
 Tax free bonds are the best possible investment option for investors in the 20 per cent and 30 per cent tax brackets when compared with bank fixed deposits.

 This may offer the much-needed trigger for cement stocks that have failed to report meaningful returns in the past six months. Over the past year, pet coke, coal, and diesel prices have fallen in the range of 6-25%. This has reduced operating costs of cement companies in terms of lower costs.
 
 On average, power, and fuel costs of prominent cement companies fell by 13% in the September 2015 quarter in comparison with the corresponding quarter last year. In addition, their freight costs also fell by nearly 5%. Power, oil, fuel and freight costs together eat into 20-30% of net sales revenues of most cement companies.
 
 
 

 
 With crude oil expected to remain stagnant over the next year due to oversupply, costs of pet coke and diesel - both derivatives of crude - are expected to be range bound, cushioning the input costs for cement makers.
 
 They are also expected to benefit from higher construction activities in the second half of the fiscal, which often result in higher cement prices. It is observed that in the second half of a fiscal, prominent cement makers report close to 100 basis points jump in their operating profit margins.
 
 Given these factors, analysts estimate that cement prices to go up in the range of 200-300 basis points, which in turn would boost operating profit margins of cement companies in the range of 200-400 basis points.
 
 The ET cement index fell by 4.6% in the past six months in tandem with a similar fall in the benchmark CNX Nifty.
 
 Investors may expect a turnaround in stock prices given the improved revenue visibility and expectations of better profitability in the coming quarters."

ET Now: What about pharmaceutical stocks? The way some brokerages have raised concerns over these stocks, and the significant correction we witnessed last week, investors fear that these stocks are getting toppish. Is there too much to read into that or would you use these dips to buy?
 
 
Hemindra Hazari: I would look upon this as a buying opportunity. You have to acknowledge the fact that pharma counters have performed exceedingly well.
 
 Hence, profit booking is obvious. In addition, there have been some concerns over cross-currency headwinds that may hurt the fourth quarter numbers of drug makers.
 
 Earnings could also be impacted by lack of product approvals in the US and regulatory issues that have come in.
 
 The analyst community is just voicing some caution. This is probably an opportunity for some to book profits. Having said that, I would like to add that this is one of the sectors which I have liked and will continue to like. In India, it will be the external demand triggers, rather than domestic demand triggers which will be more important.

3i Infotech: Sale of low-margin biz to help boost profitability,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/3i-infotech-sale-of-low-margin-biz-to-help-boost-profitability/articleshow/8378689.cms,m.economictimes.com,3i Infotech: Sale of low-margin biz to help boost profitability,"The sale of low-growth, low-margin payment processing business would enhance 3i Infotech’s focus on its core IT products and services business. But it will take at least two quarters for its profitability to reflect the positive impact of the development. 
  
  The proceeds of $137 million (around Rs 610 crore) from the sale of the transaction services division to Cerberus Capital Management will be utilised to reduce the current debt burden by nearly 30% to Rs 1,500 in the near term. 
  
  This will also reduce 3i Infotech’s debt-equity ratio to 1.2 from 1.6. In 2007-2008, mid-tier IT player 3i Infotech had entered the US payment processing market through acquisitions of Regulus, J&B Software, and JP Morgan’s unit. 
  
  This was a part of 3i Infotech’s strategy to strengthen its presence in the US banking and finance segment. The strategy, however, hit the roadblock during the subprime crisis in late 2008. The revenue from this segment since then has remained sluggish. For instance, the total annual revenue earned by the three units at the time of acquisition was over Rs 800 crore. 
  
  With revenue of Rs 820 crore in FY11, it has hardly budged from the threeyear-ago level. In FY11, revenue from 3i Infotech’s IT products and services rose by 14% whereas it was 10.4% lower for the transaction services. 
  
  According to company’s MD and global CEO V Srinivasan, the sale is highly lucrative. He mentions the company had spent $25 million (Rs 115 crore) of internal accruals (equity) towards the total purchase value of $ 115 million (around Rs 530 crore) for the three units in 2008. 
  
  The company has earned $ 45 million (over Rs 207 crore) in operating profit before depreciation so far. Considering this and the current sale value, return on equity turns out to be more than 200%, highlights Mr Srinivasan. 
  
  The latest sale will lower the company’s future net profit but the impact will be mitigated largely due to the reduction in interest cost and depreciation. Srinivasan pegs a decline of one rupee or 8% in the annual earnings per share. But in the long run, its profitability is expected to improve by 100-200 basis points now that the company has sold the low-margin business."

ET Now: How do you see the first day of the new futures and options series?
 
Mitesh Thacker: Thursday's close has been good. The intraday buying seen during the day confirmed that 8,320-8,330 on Nifty should now act as the immediate support level. Bank Nifty has just managed to sneak above 18,500 despite the fact that the last half-an-hour of trade was volatile for it.
 
 In case, Bank Nifty sustains above these levels, despite some kind of weakness in the CNX IT, I would maintain a slightly positive bias for the next few days. Bank Nifty could possibly outperform along with the energy and pharma stocks. May be, these sectors will pull up the Nifty to 8,450-8,500.
 
 Meanwhile, if CNX IT continues to trade below 11,300, then it will have a 200-300 point kind of a decline. Overall, on the broad basis, Nifty might move up. That is what I will look at. I will also be trading more of long bias on individual stocks and would possibly place a couple of short calls on the IT stocks."

Amara Raja Batteries offers a good buying opportunity for investors,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/amara-raja-batteries-offers-a-good-buying-opportunity-for-investors/articleshow/16408082.cms,m.economictimes.com,Amara Raja Batteries offers a good buying opportunity for investors,"The quarterly result of Amara Raja Batteries, India’s second largest battery maker, has been better than expected, justifying its recent re-rating. The company’s revenue and net profit for the first quarter of 2012-13 have zoomed up by 32% and 95%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.
 
 This stellar performance can be attributed to the increased capacity in the automotive segment and increasing demand in the UPS business. Though the rupee depreciation has taken some sheen off the significant fall in prices of lead on the London Metal Exchange (LME), the 5% fall in rupee terms (after adjusting the currency impact) helped the margin expansion.
 
 The battery demand in India continues to zoom because of frequent power cuts, leading to a rise in demand for UPS batteries, and an expanding automotive market. Though the demand from the original equipment manufacturers is not that high, it is compensated by the strong demand from the replacement market; 60% of its revenue comes from the auto segment and around 65% of its auto segment revenue comes from the replacement market.
 
 
  The battery business in India is also getting organised with a shift from unorganised to organised players. This is helping players like Amara Raja and the market leader, Exide Industries. With a strong brand franchise and efficient two-tier dealer network, Amara Raja continues to fortify its position in the current duopolistic market conditions.
 
 It has managed to register a volume growth of 14-15% across its industrial and automotive segments. This structural up-trend is also helping it improve its earnings quality.
 
 Analysts believe that the stock continues to be attractively priced despite the recent rise in its price. Compared with its expected earnings growth rate of 25-30% in the future, Amara Raja’s stock is still trading at 13 times its historical earnings.
 
 This means that its PE-to-growth ratio is still close to 0.5 times and, therefore, a further re-rating is possible. The negligible debt and sufficient cash reserve are other factors that are attracting investors to this counter because they will help Amara Raja tap the upcoming growth opportunities in India as well as in the international market without much difficulty.
 
 Selection methodology: We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the past month. The rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weightages to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in rating indicates that the analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock.

"At Rs 22 lakh, MRF is most costly futures contract",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/at-rs-22-lakh-mrf-is-most-costly-futures-contract/articleshow/26545423.cms,m.economictimes.com,"At Rs 22 lakh, MRF is most costly futures contract","MUMBAI: Planning to trade in the counter of mid-cap tyre company MRF in the derivatives segment? Well, the chances are that you may not be able to afford it. A single lot of MRF futures on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) is worth more than Rs 22 lakh, making it the most expensive futures contract.
 
 As per the circular by market regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the lot size of any derivatives contract should not be less than Rs 2 lakh and shouldn’t be more than Rs 4 lakh. The lot size of MRF in the derivatives segment is 125 shares and its stock price is close toRs 18,000 per share. While the share price of MRF rose sharply this year from a low of around Rs 10,000 in November last year, NSE has not revised its lot size. When contacted, NSE said it was merely following the Sebi circular.
 
 A lot size is nothing but fixed units of a particular security that can be bought or sold in the derivatives segment. The lot size is fixed according to the price of the security and other factors.
 
 “It is surprising to see that a single lot of stock futures is worth Rs 22 lakh, which makes it impossible even for high net worth traders to take positions,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares and Securities.
 
 Traders require around 30% margin money to trade in derivatives contracts. Therefore, over Rs 6.5 lakh is needed if you were to trade in a single lot of MRF futures on the NSE.
 
 “MRF, in the first place, does not deserve to be in the derivatives segment,” said SP Tulsian, independent equity advisor. “The volumes in the MRF counter are extremely thin and the counter seems to be controlled by operators due to its expensive lot size.”
 
 Sebi has stipulated that an exchange should revise lot sizes of contracts every six months, but it has also clarified that “wherever warranted, revise the lot size by giving an advance notice of at least two weeks to the market”.
 
 In the case of MRF, market players contend that a revision was warranted, but nothing of the sort happened. Often, exchanges prefer to trade in derivatives contracts of companies that have high daily trading volumes and market depth, which check volatility and price distortion. Due to its expensive contract size, the spreads or the price gap between buy and sell orders of MRF are usually Rs 50 or more. For instance, the top buy order for MRF at around 2:30 pm on Thursday was Rs 17,860 while the sell was asking for Rs 17,925. The spreads rise in a market where there’s no volume depth."
"Bajaj Auto: Higher input costs offset sales gain, hit margins",negative,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/bajaj-autos-results-hit-by-input-cost/articleshow/6777475.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bajaj Auto's results hit by input cost,"The only disappointment in Bajaj Auto’s otherwise impressive results for the September 2010 quarter was the impact of the rising input cost structure. As a result, the company’s profit margin declined 150 basis points year-on-year to 20.7%, despite net sales showing an increase of 50.4% to Rs 4,341.8. Bajaj Auto is the second-largest player in the motorcycle segment.
  
  Its realisations per unit rose 4.4% compared with a year ago, but that could not fully offset the higher cost of rubber-based inputs, and the strengthening metal prices. As a result, its adjusted raw material costs as a percentage of net sales increased 440 basis points to 67% in the September quarter compared with a year earlier. 
  
  Buoyant sales of variants of its Pulsar and Discover models helped the company attain a market share of 34% in the motorcycle segment, a growth both on a sequential and year-on-year basis. Strong sales volume also helped the company’s net profit improve by 69.3% to Rs 682.1 crore compared with a year earlier.
  
  The company recently brought on stream additional production capacity at its Pantnagar plant in Uttarakhand, which would ease the supply constraints on its premium models, Pulsar and Discover. Also, tax breaks in the state and better realisations from these models should help Bajaj Auto to deal better with the rising cost structure, say analysts.
  
  Apart from raw material costs, analysts are increasingly worried about the growing competition in the motorcycle segment, with the recent entry of diversified player Mahindra & Mahindra. Also, Honda’s probable exit from Hero Honda and its plans to scale up its presence in the motorcycle segment could further put pressure on margins in this segment. 
  
  Bajaj Auto’s stock fell marginally by 0.6% to Rs 1,512.6 in a weak broader market on Tuesday but it is still not too far away from its 52-week high reached in early October. At these levels, its trailing 12 months P/E works out to be 19.2. Sector leader Hero Honda’s stock trades at a P/E of around 16. 
  
  The premium valuation of Bajaj Auto can be attributed to its superior operating margin compared with Hero Honda’s. Going ahead, analysts expect strong sales momentum of the company to continue. However, its current valuations appear to have fully factored in the future incremental growth."

In dollar terms, Wipro's revenue growth is expected to be 2-3%. In January, the company had given a revenue growth guidance of 1- 3% for the quarter. 
 Wipro's fourth-quarter earnings come in the wake of mixed signals from India's top IT firms, a reason why its numbers will be watched even more closely by analysts.

Brokerages up target price for Tech Mahindra post Comviva buy,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/brokerages-up-target-price-for-tech-mahindra-post-comviva-buy/articleshow/16446613.cms,m.economictimes.com,Brokerages up target price for Tech Mahindra post Comviva buy,"MUMBAI: Brokerages raised Tech Mahindra’s target price on Tuesday, a day after the company acquired a 51 per cent stake in Bharti Group-owned Comviva Technologies for Rs 260 crore, and expect the stock to get re-rated. 

 Bharti Group will continue to hold a 20 per cent equity ownership in the new company Mahindra Comviva while Tech Mahindra will own 51 per cent. 

 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch has reset estimates and raised Tech Mahindra and Satyam’s rating to Buy. 

 “Deal wins & acquisition announced by TechM over the past fortnight are likely to give the company critical scale in large strategic accounts like Hutch, KPN. Moreover, steady growth in AT&T and likely stabilization in top client BT set stage for an improved organic growth trajectory. Deal pipeline is healthy and we could see a few more closures in the next couple of quarters,” the report said. 

 The brokerage has a price target of Rs 1,150, an upside of over 25 per cent from the current market price. 

 Most brokerages are of the view that the acquisition will help strengthen Tech Mahindra expertise in the mobile VAS domain. 

 “We believe the acquisition is another step by the Tech Mahindra management to achieve its stated target of doubling revenues over the next three years. It would not only deepen TechM’s expertise in the mobile VAS domain and give access to over 100 global telecom operators, but also keep its telecom exposure at an elevated level,” said an IDFC report. 

 The brokerage is of the view that there is still some steam left for re-rating of the stock. It has maintained ‘Outperformer’ rating with a 12-month price target of Rs 1,050, based on ~12x avg. FY13-14E EPS. 

 Meanwhile, Dolat Capital Market in the report post acquisition has revised its target price upward and expects the stock to get re-rated. 

 “The positive news flow continues to reinforces our view of re-rating of the stock considering its strong business aggression organically (Dutch Telecom deal) and inorganically (Comviva and HGS Deal) to boost the revenue growth traction. We maintain Tech Mahindra as our top pick with a revised target price of Rs 1,180 (earlier Rs 1065) valued at 10x (earlier 9x) of its FY14E earnings,” the report said. 

 Shares of Tech Mahindra gained momentum after acquiring a 51 per cent stake in Bharti Group-owned mobile value-added services provider Comviva Technologies for Rs 260 crore.

"Calculus: Recovery in China, new models may help Tata Motors",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/calculus-recovery-in-china-new-models-may-help-tata-motors/articleshow/49719878.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Calculus: Recovery in China, new models may help Tata Motors","Tata Motors reported a net loss for the September 2015 quarter, the first such loss in at least 25 quarters on account of slower growth in its Chinese market and higher expenses due to certain operating factors. While this may cause some concern among investors, the medium-term trend looks positive considering a gradual recovery in Chinese demand, scheduled launch of new models and falling input costs.
 
 The September quarter performance was marred due to certain expenses that depressed the earnings of Jaguar Land Rover, a Tata Motors' subsidiary which contributes more than 90 per cent to its revenue. JLR reported Rs 2,493 crore expense (on its books) on account of cars damaged due to the fire that erupted at Tianjin port in China where 5,800 Jaguar Land Rover's car were stored. The company has applied for the insurance claims but it will take several months to receive the insurance payout.
 
 Then, there was bunching-up of product launch costs inflating the other expenditure. The company has launched Discovery Sport (February 2015), Jaguar XE (Many 2015), Lightweight Jaguar XF (September 2015) since the beginning of the year. In addition, given that several facelift models will be introduced in the next few months, it has led to a higher average discount level per vehicle.
 
 

 
 Plummeting volumes in China hurt margins and volume growth of the company. The contribution from China's volume to the total sales volume has come down to 17.6 per cent in September quarter against 27 per cent in the same period a year ago. The fall in China's contribution has impacted profitability since vehicles sold in the world's second largest economy fetch a superior margin as compared with other geographies.
 
 Given the subdued demand, the company relaxed credit terms to Chinese dealers, thereby increasing the working capital requirement for JLR. All these factors reduced operating margins by nearly 500 bps from the year ago.
 
 Some early indicators point at revival in volumes and a possible margin improvement in the coming quarters. China's auto sales volume increased by 11 per cent in October - the first time in seven months - after the government cut tax on some car segments to boost sagging demand. JLR has launched locally produced Discovery Sport at a discount to the imported version in China. The company has guided sales volume of 500,000 JLR units for the current fiscal which seems to be achievable with China sales rebounding and double-digit volume growth in big markets such as the US and UK.
 
 Along with this, JLR will launch its two midrange sedan Jaguar XE in the US and Jaguar F Pace (a crossover) in 2016, which is expected to support volume growth.
 
 Analysts had a target price of over Rs 700 for Tata Motors' stock before the slowdown in China was visible. Back then, the company was commanding an EVEBITDA of 8-8.5. Though Chinese demand is recuperating, it is expected to be a slower recovery. Hence, there will be compression in EVEBITDA multiple, which has prompted analysts to adjust the target price in the range of Rs 480-500 per share."

However, barring these positive factors, sales and profit growth remained subdued during the June quarter. A sample of 2,171 companies, excluding banks and finance firms and oil & gas companies, reported a 1.3% year-on-year growth in net sales and 2.2% drop in net profit for the first quarter of 2015-16.
 
 “The sales and profit performance was mostly on expected lines. Operating margin, however, was better than expected,” said Nischal Maheshwari, head of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities.
 
 Operating margin of the sample rose 150 basis points (bps) to 17.4% from the previous quarter, close to the 17.5% margin in the June quarter of the previous fiscal. Margins improved for the first time in the April-June 2015 quarter after skidding in each of the previous three quarters. The sample also showed a 185 bps drop in interest cost as a percentage of PBIT (profit before interest & tax) to 29.4% compared with the previous quarter. However, it remained significantly higher than the year-ago level of 27%, indicating that the aggregate operating profit of India Inc did not increase as much as the rise in interest outgo.
 
 For this ratio to improve, revenue needs to grow faster than the current rate, which can only happen once demand recovers.
 
 
‘POOR CAPACITY UTILISATION’
 
 “Sales growth will be hard to come by at the moment considering poor capacity utilisation. And lower sales growth has caused India Inc’s asset utilisation to fall,” said Dhananjay Sinha, economist and strategist, Emkay Global Financial Services.
 
 Chances are the numbers could improve in the next two quarters ending September and December 2015, thanks to the base effect. Single-digit sales growth in the yearago period is likely to help India Inc report better top line. But growth led by real demand push may be visible only by the end of the current fiscal, feel analysts.
 
 “We continue to believe that any revival in earnings would commence only from the second half of FY16 (December 2016 quarter). The second quarter (September) is a seasonally slow quarter, so we may not see a significant improvement in the earnings,” said Vaibhav Agrawal, V-P & head of research, Angel Broking.
 
 The depreciation in the Chinese currency is a major event, according to some experts. “It is likely to put pressure on export-oriented companies in India in sectors such as chemicals and textiles where Indian companies compete with their Chinese counterparts,” said Maheshwari of Edelweiss.
 
 The performance across sectors during the June 2015 quarter was mixed as companies with pricing power in some sectors such as FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) and automobiles were able to take advantage of lower commodity prices. On the other hand, companies in the capital goods, power, pharmaceuticals and metals continued to perform poorly due to slack demand.
 
 
AUTOMOBILES
 
 While the earnings growth of auto companies for the June quarter was as expected, some of them surprised the street with better realisation, average discount level and margins. Backed by cost efficiencies and higher realisation per vehicle, Maruti and Bajaj Auto outlived expectations. Hero MotoCorp reported better margins. M&M expanded margins in the tractors segment despite a drop in volume. Contrary to general expectation, the management of M&M expects tractor growth to be 5% in the current fiscal. However, Hero Moto-Corp’s commentary on two-wheeler volumes caused analysts to lower estimates for FY16.
 
 
CAPITAL GOODS
 
 Paucity of orders — except for some pickup in roads and power transmission — and difficulties in project execution continue to haunt the sector. The biggest infrastructure company, L&T, reported lower than expected earnings growth. But it maintained the guidance for margin, revenue and order inflows for FY16.
 
 
CEMENT
 
 The June quarter reflected seasonal weakness to a large extent. With the exception of South-based cement companies which benefitted from improvement in demand, companies in other regions faced slow offtake. Besides low activity in infrastructure projects, slowdown in real estate construction has hit volumes. Among larger cement companies, only UltraTech could beat analyst estimates. Demand, growing at 2-3%, could more than double in the next two years as construction activities in rural and urban infrastructure and real estate projects gather steam.
 
 
FMCG
 
 It was a mixed bag: sluggish volumes, savings on cost and improved margins. Market leader Hindustan Unilever Limited maintained 6% volume growth in the domestic consumer business. Companies such as Britannia and Emami did well while most others disappointed. While tapering off of rural growth remains a concern, benign input cost is likely to provide room for margin expansion. This will allow companies to invest more in brands. The phasing out of excise duty benefits will continue to hurt the top line growth of companies such as HUL and Colgate-Palmolive. The upcoming festive season is likely to be the next trigger for growth. IT Barring Infosys, other top IT exporters including Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and HCL Technologies reported slightly lower than expected growth in dollar-denominated revenue for the June 2015 quarter. Margins dropped due to salary increases and US visa costs. Volumes are traditionally better in the September quarter. Companies are expected to do well given their strong order books and the weakness in the rupee against the dollar.
 
 
METALS
 
 Metal companies were hit by falling commodity prices and lower demand. Companies reported lower sales and profits with contraction in margin. No immediate recovery in metal prices is expected on account of the downturn in the commodity cycle.
 
 
PHARMA
 
 While Dr Reddy’s outperformed, Sun Pharma and Lupin posted disappointing numbers. Absence of any major drug launches and slowdown in drug approvals in the US impacted sales. This was partly compensated by recovery in the domestic market. Future growth will depend on the pickup in drug approvals in the US, monetisation of product pipeline and volume recovery in the domestic market.
 
 
POWER
 
 Subdued demand led to lower capacity utilisation for major power utilities. In the June quarter, all India thermal plant load factor (PLF), or capacity utilisation, stood at 62% as against 67% in the same period last year. However, companies saw an improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortisation) margin due to lower fuel costs. Demand is expected to remain sluggish until industrial demand recovers."

 Industry may have less than four months of beans on hand to meet demand, according to Eric Sivry, head of agricultural options brokerage at Marex Spectron Group in London. Gains may be limited if Ghana accelerates sales of next year's harvest. “A comfortable level of forward cover for the industry would be eight to nine months or more,” Sivry said by email on Tuesday. “Many believe that Ghana may soon jump in and offer a clip of new crop.” 

 Cocoa for March delivery climbed 0.7% to $2,800 a tonne on ICE Futures in New York after earlier on Tuesday gaining to $2,820, the highest for a most active contract since September 15, 2011. Ghana is the secondbiggest grower after Ivory Coast. 

 In London, cocoa jumped as much as 0.9% to 1,781 pounds ($2,868) a tonne, the highest since September 21, 2011. White, or refined, sugar rose 0.2% to $471 a tonne and raw sugar advanced 0.2% to 17.78 cents a pound. Robusta coffee fell 0.2% to $1,563 a tonne and Arabica coffee declined 0.7%."

But the stock has underperformed due to higher ad spends pulling down profit growth. Chances are that the situation can change during the year.
 
 
Consistent Rise in Market Share
 
 Colgate has managed to increase its market share for toothpaste every year in the last four years. The market share for toothbrushes has also increased over four years to 42.1 per cent.
 
 
Ad Spends to Moderate
 
 Two years ago, Colgate raised its ad spends to 19 per cent of sales from around 10 per cent after P&G introduced Oral-B toothpaste. A lower ad spend from now on would help improve profit margins. Analysts expect operating margins (EBIDTA) to increase by 3-4.5 per cent in the next two years.
 
 

 
 
Portfolio Premiumisation
 
 Share of premium (value added) products, such as Sensitive Pro-relief Enamel Repair and Active Salt with Neem toothpastes, in total sales has increased to 20 per cent from 10 per cent three years ago. In other countries, premium products account for a much higher share of total sales. The benefits are beginning to show. In the March quarter of 2015, the company’s operating profit was highest in the last 12 quarters.
 
 
Dividend Payout to Improve
 
 With Colgate rolling out its highest capital expenditure plans over the last two years, dividend payout fell to 65 per cent of net profit in 2014-15 from 88 per cent in 2012-13. Since the capex cycle is over, the payout is expected to be higher in the coming years."

But overall the bias continues to be bullish - there is no change in that situation. The moment the expiry pressure eases off, we might actually see a flare-up in the Nifty and the Nifty could retest its recent high of 6250.

Cotton rally forces textile mills to go for small buys,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/cotton-rally-forces-textile-mills-to-go-for-small-buys/articleshow/6661798.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cotton rally forces textile mills to go for small buys,"COIMBATORE & CHANDIGARH: With cotton prices at a 15-year high, textile mills are looking to buy the commodity in smaller quantities instead of the usual bulk purchases they do in the first six months of the new season. The mills are also planning to hold stocks for two months instead of six months.
  
  And the companies fear that the prices will only increase with exporters on a buying spree to ensure shipments for November. The prices of Shankar 6, a much-sought-after variety, is ruling at Rs 38,500 per candy when compared to Rs 22,500 per candy during the same period last year. While cotton prices have increased by 70% in the past one year, yarn prices have moved up by around 50%.
  
  The 30s count yarn was selling at Rs 125 per kg during the last week of September 2009 but it is ruling at Rs 185 per kg now. The 40s count yarn prices have jumped to Rs 197 per kg from Rs 132 per kg last year. For textile mills, the October-March period is crucial during which they will buy cotton in bulk quantities and store it for the rest of the year.
  
  The Ludhiana-based Nahar group, which consumes 10 lakh bales annually, is procuring cotton on a day-to-day basis. “We have a daily requirement of 3,500 bales (one bale weighs 170 kg) but are procuring 1,700 bale due to the spiralling rates,” said Nahar group’s raw material general manager Ashok Kapoor. The company is procuring Punjab’s J-34 variety for Rs 3,660-3,700 per maund (one maund equals 37.3 kg). 
  
  “We have to buy left, right and centre. But, instead of holding stock for longer period, we might opt for two months’ stock,” said Coimbatore-based Rs 803-crore KPR Mills managing director P Natraj. The vertically-integrated KPR group, which has a 2.12-lakh spindle capacity, sells 75% of the yarn it produces to Tirupur exporters while the rest is consumed internally. 
  
  Most garment manufacturers have even started getting orders for cotton blended with polyester to cut cost. Ludhiana-based Venus Garments (India), exporter of knitwear to international retailers like Wal-Mart, Old Navy and Tom Tailor, has since the past two months started manufacturing polyester-cotton blend knitted garments for a few clients. 
  
  “There is a cost-saving of over 10% with polyester filament prices at Rs 80-100 a kg,” said Venus Garments managing director Anil Jain.
  
  For the Rs 208-crore Ambika Cotton Mills, which produces compact yarn used for shirting purpose, the dependency on local cotton is around 40% of its total requirement. 
  
  “We import long-staple cotton from abroad and we have no issues on that. But on the local front, we are struggling to get cotton despite being ready to pay international prices,” said Ambika Cotton CMD PV Chandran. He added that there were concerns of ginners blending long-staple cotton with short-staple varieties after January. Spinners are now mulling an increase in yarn prices. Confederation of Indian Textile Industry deputy chairman and Coimbatore-based Rs 355-crore Bannari Amman Spinning Mills managing director SV Arumugam said the association has to raise yarn cost to offset the increasing cotton prices. “We are meeting on October 1 to decide on yarn price increase,” he said."
Cotton rises 10% on demand for exports and local consumption,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/cotton-rises-10-on-demand-for-exports-and-local-consumption/articleshow/29468255.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cotton rises 10% on demand for exports and local consumption,"PUNE: Bullish market sentiments have led to an increase of 10% in cotton prices in just about a month. Good demand for exports as well as for domestic consumption and staggered release by farmers, who are holding on to the crop anticipating the prices to move up further, have supported the uptrend in the prices of the fibre crop. 

 The market is bullish about cotton prices. “Ruling at Rs 43,000 per candy (of 356 kg each), cotton prices have increased by Rs 4,000/candy in just about a month fromRs 39,000/candy due to the bullish sentiments in the market,” said Bharat Wala, president, Saurashtra Ginners Association. 

 Demand from China, the biggest buyer of Indian cotton, is not much. But the exports to other countries have helped keep the prices firm. BS Rajpal, MD, Aurangabad-based Manjeet Cotton said, “There is good demand for Indian cotton from Bangladesh and Pakistan, for premium quality cotton.” The local demand from spinning mills is also good. “Yarn prices are buoyant supporting the uptrend in cotton prices,” said an official of a cotton trading company on condition of anonymity. 

 The MSP of long staple cotton is Rs 3,900/quintal. However, farmers are currently getting about Rs 4,800/quintal to Rs 5,200/quintal. The arrival of cotton is very limited keeping the prices firm. As per the statistics available with the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), the arrival of raw cotton till January 26 is less by about 17% as compared to arrivals during same period of previous year. 

 Traders, ginners claim that the arrivals are restricted due to hoarding capacity of farmers. “Equipped with latest market information, the big farmers are releasing cotton in the market in a staggered manner,” said LV Loyalka, in-charge, operations, Central India, Olam Agro India. 

 Along with the big farmers/traders, ginners are also holding on to a big quantity of cotton expecting expecting the prices to move upward in the days to come. Pradip Jain, president, Khandesh Gin-Press Association said, “At the current prices of raw cotton, it is not affordable for ginners to sell cotton bales.” 

 However, there are mixed estimates about the cotton prices. As per one view, the cotton prices are likely to come under pressure from mid-February as the buying by mills declines due to financial year-ending procedures. While, prices are also expected to increase due to lesser carry forward stocks. “The prices are also expected to increase further from April due to ‘hands to mouth’ situation of Indian spinning mills,” said Rajpal."

 The Sensex has shed over 450 points in 2014 so far, making it the second worst New Year show in nearly two decades, but the leading foreign brokerage is hopeful of Indian equities touching new peaks in coming months. 

 ""Year 2014 will herald the beginning of a bull market in the country and we are setting the Sensex target at 24,000 and an imputed Nifty target of 7,148, implying an upside of 16 per cent from the current levels. 

 ""The Sensex would trade at a PE of 15.9 times which is broadly in line with the past five-year average,"" Deutsche Equities India Research Head Abhay Laijawala told reporters. 

 Although the domestic economy has bottomed out, a recovery is likely to be gradual, showing a perceptible improvement only in the second half of the next fiscal, once the private sector investment cycle starts to revive, he said. 

 ""While we are convinced that economic growth and earnings cycle have bottomed out, the pace of recovery will be crucially determined by the outcome of the national elections, which may form the fulcrum for investor sentiment. 

 ""For equity markets, the 2014 outlook will hence hinge on the ability of either of the two national parties (BJP and Congress) to anchor a stable coalition. We think whoever gets at least 180 seats may form a coalition Government,"" he said. 

 The year is likely to see many an inflection point for the country and its equity market, Laijawala said, as he sees domestic investor disenchantment with equities ebbing. 

 A subdued outlook for oil and gold prices further sweeten the investment thesis, he said. 

 On sectoral picks, he said ""our biggest ""overweights"" are IT services and banks with consumer staples being our largest ""underweight"". 

 On the risks to economic growth, Laijawala said the biggest threat comes from an unfavourable election outcome leading to a fragmented coalition Government. On the external front, any sign of a faster-than-anticipated tightening by the US Fed will be a source of investor concern."

The first quarter of our financial performance has been positive, in terms of maintaining a healthy loan portfolio and net profit.
 
 During the quarter, we also completed 30 years of our journey in providing home loans to low and middle income customers. Our strong business foundations built over the years and our focus on the lower and middle income customer segment have contributed significantly to this 30 year growth story.

We are confident that in the coming quarters, our efforts will be towards strengthening customer offerings whilst driving higher shareholder value.”"
Discom loan recast to power up shares of PSU banks,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/discom-loan-recast-to-power-up-shares-of-psu-banks/articleshow/49264933.cms,m.economictimes.com,Discom loan recast to power up shares of PSU banks,"MUMBAI: Shares of state-owned banks such as Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India and others that have underperformed the market so far this year may get rerated if the government clears the plan to restructure Rs 4.3 lakh crore loans of nine state power distribution companies. 

 Analysts said if the plan is approved, PSU banks will be able to upgrade these loans to standard category, which will bring down risk weightage to 20 per cent from current risk weight of 125 per cent. 

 Lowering of the minimum risk weight means banks will have to set aside less capital for the sector, leading to availability of more funds for lending to other segments. ""PSU banks and infrastructure lenders may get rerated if the government considers loan restructuring of state power distribution companies, along with power sector reforms, including tariff hikes,"" said PVK Mohan, head – equity and senior fund manager at Principal PNB Asset Management Company. 

 Government-owned infra-lenders like REC and PFC will also benefit if the debt restructuring proposal is approved. Indian banking system’s exposure to power sector is estimated at Rs 5.8 lakh crore, or 8.7 per cent of the total bank credit as of August-end. Most state electricity boards’ loan exposure is on the books of PSU banks, said analysts. 

 ""Restructuring loans of discoms is positive for state owned banks and bank ing system as issues regarding non-performing loans will get addressed,"" said Sampath Reddy, chief investment officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance. 

 About 8 per cent of Canara Bank and Central Bank of India’s loan expsoure are to SEBs. Allahabad Bank has 7 per cent, Syndicate Bank has 6 per cent, Bank of India has 4 per cent and Punjab National Bank has 3 per cent loan exposure to SEBs. 

 Shares of state-owned banks have underperformed the markets significantly this year so far. Oriental Bank of Commerce has plunged 58 per cent year to date, Bank of India has dropped 53 per cent, United Bank of India has declined 53 per cent, while UCO Bank has fallen 45 per cent, underperforming the BSE Bankex Index, which has dropped only 6.25 per cent this year so far. 

 ""Shares of PSU banks that have seen some investor interest on news that the government may recast loans of state power distribution companies may get rerated if the proposal is approved,"" said P Phani Sekhar, fund manager PMS, Karvy Stock Broking. 

 Private sector banks do not have direct exposure to state electricity boards but could benefit from the implementation of these reforms."

  What is the call on ENIL?
   
  One should start with a longer term chart here because that has been sideways for practically 2 years. It is the upper end of it. That is of interest now because we are getting closer to that, is about Rs 285. So that is the breakout, long way to go from here but overall, now if we move to the short or medium term, this is a safe distance of those February lows which is the benchmark I am using. 
  
  In fact it is about 20-25% above it. So short to medium term certainly looks quite healthy and results would give it a boost but longer term, you have got to see now whether if somebody buys it now, hoping for that breakout. 285 is where they should see if it gets past or not and keep a very tight trailing stop there."

 The stock is likely to benefit with the sale of tractors on the back of good monsoon and as investors turn attention to auto sector on hopes of pick-up in demand. 

 “Escorts reported 4QFY13 results well above our expectations largely led by good performance in the tractor business,” said Kotak Securities - Private Client Research report. 

 The revenues during the quarter improved by 15 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 9,442 million. 

 “The growth came primarily on account of 15 per cent tractor volume growth. EBITDA margin improved from 5.7 per cent in 4QFY12 to 6.8 per cent. PAT increased significantly from Rs 189 million in 4QFY12 to Rs 436 million during the quarter,” said Kotak Securities - Private Client Research report. 

 According to the brokerage, the company’s tractor business performance remained robust on strong demand revival. Auto ancillary and construction equipment business continued with weak performance. 

 Meanwhile, the management is upbeat about the business and expects margins to touch double digits. 

 “We are earning a good level of 6.8 per cent, and we will cross 10% in the next eight-nine months,” said Rajan Nanda, CMD, Escorts in an interview to ET Now. 

 “The business momentum is building because strategically we were planning growth of our market share and our business volumes in the market will link to our introduction of new products. Strategically, we are working on reducing our fixed cost and increasing our working margins,” Nanda added.

 For about two years, tractor maker Escorts had been struggling with a sliding market share and margin pressure. But the company did a course correction, tweaked a few things around, and is getting back on track.
 
 In order to improve its earnings profile, Escorts is now redefining market share by focusing on higher-priced products and vacating lower-margin ones completely. It is also taking a series of steps to prune cost, align company’s parameters with that of the industry, and carve out a pan-India presence for itself. It has exited low-margin business of tractors up to 30 HP (horse power) and concentrated on the higher margin segment between 30 HP and 60 HP, and plans to top the 50 HP-plus segment.
 
 The changes are paying off. The margins from the tractor vertical have risen to 10% from 4.5% in the past two years. With better financials, its stock, too, has gained 81% in the past year compared with BSE Auto index’s 6%. Tractor sales constitute 80% of Escorts’ earnings while the rest comes from auto ancillary, railway braking and construction equipment.
 
 “Our approach is to set a new competition benchmark in the tractor segment. We perceive John Deere as our main competitor rather than market leader M&M,” said S Sridhar, CEO, agri machinery division, Escorts.
 
 On the operational aspect, the company is tackling each segment -- between 30HP and 60 HP -- to drive volume growth. In the 30-40 HP segment, which constitutes 35% of volume, it has launched Euro series tractor which provides more power and mileage.
 
 Escorts expects the Euro series sales to touch 2,500 units by the next quarter, with the potential to reach 4,000 units. The possible addition of the Euro series has been delayed by 75 days as quality upgradation to European standards took time.
 
 Among the eight products upgrade, five are already done and three are expected in the next six months. But the company’s real challenges lie in the 40-50 HP segment, which constitutes nearly 50% of industry sales. Historically, Escorts enjoyed a market share of 20% in this segment, but slipped to 16% because of its limited presence in the southern/western markets.
 
 Escorts is taking corrective measures to change this situation. It is raising its dealership to 900 from 750 currently, out of which 50% are likely to be in the southern/western region. “Our aim is to capture 6% market share next year in southern/western India, and take it to 10-12% in the next five years,” said S Sridhar, CEO, agri machinery division, Escorts.
 
 The company’s experiment of focusing on higher HP tractor category has started delivering results in the over-50 HP category, where it aims to attain leadership position.
 
 The market share in the 50-HP segment increased to 6% in the December 2013 quarter from 1.5% in FY11. Now, the company is targeting a market share of 8-10% next year and 20% in the next three years. Escorts expects margins from tractor vertical to touch 15% in the next three years from the 10% at present on the back of better product mix and cost rationalisation.
 
 On the cost side, employee count has been reduced to 300 in the past two years and the company is planning to further reduce another 200 in the next two years."

 At end March 2015, the sector’s share in portfolios of domestic funds and foreign funds was 11.6% and 9.6%, respectively. About 14 mutual funds, out of the top 20, are all overweight on this sector. The bullishness can be attributed to four key reasons:
 
 1. A relatively low vehicle penetration level. India has an average of 13 cars for per 1,000 persons, against 158 in Brazil.
 
 2. Past data shows that the auto sector can grow as much as three times the GDP rate when growth crosses 6%.
 
 3. Auto companies usually have debt-free balance sheets.
 
 4. Auto companies have higher dividend payouts. (Companies like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have had average dividend payouts of 57% and 47% in the past three years."
Farmers reap a tidy profit as turmeric prices shoot up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/farmers-reap-a-tidy-profit-as-turmeric-prices-shoot-up/articleshow/6000583.cms,m.economictimes.com,Farmers reap a tidy profit as turmeric prices shoot up,"ERODE: The sharp rise in turmeric prices in the past one year has brought prosperity to hundreds of farmers in Erode and nearby areas in Tamil Nadu. Engaged in turmeric cultivation for nearly three generations, the farmers had never seen so much money from one crop in their lifetime. While the farmers expected a return of around Rs 5,000 per quintal when they sowed the plant last year, the prices touched record highs in the first week of this May.
  
  At its peak, a quintal of ‘finger’ turmeric sold at Rs 15,800 and certain varieties like ‘Salem finger’ touched Rs 16,676 per quintal in Erode market, the second largest turmeric market in Asia, next to Sangli in Maharashtra. At present, the prices are hovering between Rs 15,300 and Rs 15,400. Around 20 to 40 quintal can be cultivated on one acre depending on the quality of yield. The literally nil carryover stocks due to a low output in 2009, average yield and rising global demand are said to be the reasons for soaring prices.
  
  Flush with money, farmers have enrolled their children for engineering studies and renovated their old houses. “We have almost repaid our debts with just one harvest of turmeric last year. With this year’s harvest, we expect to complete repayment of our debts and start saving for the future,” said a farmer in Kodumudi village in Erode. Kodumudi village is a major turmeric growing belt in the district. Nearly one lakh bags (each bag of 75 kg) of turmeric reaches the Erode market from this village alone. Turmeric is usually sown from May till August and harvested from January.
  
  On an average, the region comprising Erode, Bhavani, Salem, Attur and even Chamarajanagar in Karnataka contributes around 15-20 lakh bags to the country’s annual requirement of 40-45 lakh bags. In 2009, around 12 lakh bags were produced in this region. The crop area decreased in 2009 due to low price realisation in the previous year and also because of difficulty in cultivating the crop. While farmers reduced the acreage to 9,000 hectares in Erode region in 2008-09, they increased it by 15% for the current season.
  
   48-year-old farmer ES Sivanantham of Ennamangalam village in Bhavani Taluk sold 100 quintal at Rs 15,000/ quintal 10 days ago and since his family members laboured in the fields, he has reaped a profit of Rs 10 lakh. In January 2009, he sold the commodity at Rs 3,850 per quintal at a loss.
  
  Following the rise in prices, farmers have also increased the acreage of sowing from four acres to six acres this year. What if prices crash? He is not overly bothered. “It will be difficult but as farmers we have to take the risk,” he added.
  
  But a few framers like VP Krishnamurthy of Arasampattu village in Vellore district believe prices will not go below Rs 10,000 per quintal in the near future. He is hoping for the prices to hit Rs 16,000 to Rs 17,000 per quintal this year. He has around 80 quintals of turmeric in hand. The cost of turmeric cultivation per acre is around Rs 1.5 lakh with seed alone accounting for Rs 50,000 per acre. 
  
  The NAIP’s domestic and export market intelligence cell national consultant Dr N Raveendran said turmeric hits a peak once in every five years."

ET Now: From among the banks, anything else that you like, I mean specifically to IDBI Bank there has been news flow but other than that anything from the mid tier space especially that draws your fancy. 

 
Deven Choksey: Not much. I think among the mid-sized banks one is still not fully convinced that one should add them into portfolio given the variety of challenges that many of them are facing at this point of time. I would still think that the larger size banks would be relatively better off and certainly, the preference would go within the public sector space company like SBI where the downside risk is definitely protected because of the valuation at which the bank is quoting currently. 

 Given, the fact, that higher amount of growth is possible, that we are seeing the new marginal rate of lending coming up, given the fact that the non-performing related assets pressure is coming down and also the fact that many of its subsidiary companies are likely to get unlocking of valuations going forward. 

 I would think that this company would remain relatively a safer bet to add into the portfolio given the kind of potential from the banking space that we are seeing. Otherwise, some of the private sector banks remain really favourite because there the business model is more predictable and at the same time less surprises are their as far as the outcomes are concerned on different aspects of the business. So from that perspective, one would like to keep a mix of few stocks in this portfolio from the banking space and that too on very selective basis.

Festive time: Jewellery makers rally upto 48% ahead of Diwali,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/festive-time-jewellery-makers-rally-upto-48-ahead-of-diwali/articleshow/43217619.cms,m.economictimes.com,Festive time: Jewellery makers rally upto 48% ahead of Diwali,"MUMBAI: The festive season is round the corner and the limelight has shifted onto jewellery companies. Most counters have rallied between 5 and 20 per cent in the past couple of sessions on the hopes of a pick-up in demand ahead of Diwali and the marriage season.
 
 Another reason for increased demand for jewellery counters is the decline in gold prices. The yellow metal has been on a decline on the back of a firm US dollar. The demand for gold has picked up in India after a gap of almost five months.
 
 Jewellers are rushing in to re-stock gold as the price fell to Rs 26,500 per 10 gm last week from Rs 29,000 in early April, in line with international markets. Experts say import of the metal will rise in September and may touch 55 tonne compared with 47 tonne in August. Jewellers are witnessing increase in sales and footfalls, and these are expected to increase as Dhanteras nears.
 
 ""Selected jewellery companies have started to perform following correction in gold price, which is hovering near Rs 26,500 per 10 grams. Gold has multiple supports near Rs 25,000-25,500,"" said Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst – Equity Research, Anand Rathi.
 
 ""The next major trigger of demand in jewellery stocks is the upcoming festive season. As per industry experts, change in import duty, news of China to add gold in their reserves may be the reasons to give sentimental boost to these stocks,"" Taparia added.
 
 
  
Following are Taparia’s view on jewellery stocks:
 
 
Titan Company: The stock has been making higher highs - higher lows formation on monthly chart and had a strong run up from Rs 202 to Rs 402 levels in just nine months.
 
 It is in a bull run and is witnessing higher trading volumes. Fresh deliveries are seen as participants are expecting its up-move to continue in the coming weeks.
 As per its monthly chart, till it doesn’t go below Rs 363, the strength will remain intact in the stock and any decline would be utilized as a fresh buying opportunity.
 
 The stock is trading at life-time highs and is in an uncharted territory. If it holds above Rs 400, then the levels of 440-450, which is 10 per cent upside from current levels, can be expected.
 
 The stock is highly liquid. Being a part of the NSE F&O segment, options are also active. Conservative traders can ride the rally by trading in Rs 410 or 420 strike of October series.
 
 
TBZ: It was in a downtrend for the last two months and witnessed a decline from Rs 225 to Rs 137 levels. Recently, it has made its bottom formation in the Rs 140-150 zone and started to perform in line with the buying interest in all other jewellery stocks.
 
 In the last two trading sessions, it has seen the highest trading volumes of the year and also crossed & closed above its immediate hurdle of Rs 175 zones.
 If it manages to hold above Rs 175, then this rally can extend to the recent high of Rs 200 and Rs 225 levels. Now Rs 150 zone would act as a major support on declines.
 
 
PC Jeweller: The stock listed at Rs 137 in the month of December 2012 and has now doubled up. It is heading to higher territory as it is making higher top and higher bottom formation on daily, weekly and monthly charts.

Gitanjli Gems: The stock witnessed a big crack in 2013 when it fell down from Rs 650 to Rs 48 levels. Traders are stuck on the counter and so supply keeps coming in on every small bounce back.

"Force Motors a multibagger in making, says Daljeet Singh Kohli",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/force-motors-a-multibagger-in-making-says-daljeet-singh-kohli/articleshow/48282623.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Force Motors a multibagger in making, says Daljeet Singh Kohli","In an chat with ET Now, Daljeet Singh Kohli, Head of Research, IndiaNivesh Ltd, talks about the ongoing rally in the stocks of Force Motors.
 
 
ET Now: Force Motors’s management commentary per se has been about cautious optimism ahead of the June quarter numbers, It is true that the company is doing work for two premier MNC car makers and that should augur well for it, but what has driven the stellar move that has happened on the counter, up 30 per cent for the week? Is the market pre-empting an extremely strong quarter? 
 
 
Daljeet Singh Kohli: I would say that the upmove has not been exactly due to likely strong quarterly numbers.
 
 It is a very good-quality company that is available to you right now and that at no obscene valuations, in case you compare it with say Eicher or MRF or anything.
 
 So people are expecting that this company will ultimately be in that league.
 
 For example, at Rs 5,000, Bosch used to look like highly overpriced. But people are still buying the stock. So, Force Motors is a similar kind of story.
 
 If you remember, at Rs 550 seven-eight months back, we had recommended it in one of our trading calls. At that time, Rs 850 was our target price. We had thought that it will probably run up. But the stock ran up too fast. We then increased out target price for the stock to Rs 1,300. But the story since then has been the same.
 
 This company is going to scale up its business to a large extent which is right now in very few numbers, which will become into five-digit numbers. The company is talking of a total to 20,000 engines, and then increasing it to 50,000.
 
 This will mean that this company can multi-fold in size in next three to five years. All this will be done with very high quality of management.
 
 We have never heard anything from that. This is the quality being chased and the expectation that this can be another multibagger like Bosch or Eicher. So those who are holding up the stock should not even think of anything. They should just stick to it. Those who have not bought it will feel that they have been left out at every given price. So, we will rather say that if you have to have it in your portfolio, you should take that plunge, so you should buy."

  Some time back we were just wondering that this kind of foreign money in a capital scarce economy is good because once it finally starts getting into real estate and infra are they really do get a very big business boost. How significant could it be if we continue with these flows? Some of these real estate and infras companies have no shortage of orders. The real problem is easy money. Do you think that could be the significant big up move next?
   
  Absolutely, I think at the moment what we are witnessing is a combination of a very strong revival in our domestic economy and it looks like it will continue for next 2-3 years - the fund raising and access to money particularly by the smaller companies which was a constraint particularly after 2008 debacle and the entire private sector funding actually had come to a standstill. Now there is strong revival there and companies are able to raise money both through domestic market - seen in the IPO market and from foreigners. 
  
  So because of this kind of money being available - particularly to companies in the infrastructure space, real estate and whole host of other sectors - definitely it would be a big positive. The only risk that people were looking at was the interest rates going up and we think that we could see 25 to 50 basis point hike but that should not be a major constraint. So that’s a very big positive development for our markets."
Forward Markets Commission unveils uniform norms for accreditation of warehouses,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/forward-markets-commission-unveils-uniform-norms-for-accreditation-of-warehouses/articleshow/41085959.cms,m.economictimes.com,Forward Markets Commission unveils uniform norms for accreditation of warehouses,"NEW DELHI: To strengthen warehousing facilities in the commodity futures market, regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has come out with uniform norms for the accreditation of warehousing service providers.
 
 The draft rules, on which public comments have been sought by September 15, come in the wake of Rs 5,600 crore payment scam at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) that surfaced in July last year, exposing loopholes in the system.
 
 The proposed changes are being made because at present no uniform norms are being followed by national level commodity exchanges for accreditation of warehousing service providers (WSPs).
 
 ""In order to ensure uniformity at all national commodity exchanges, the Commission has decided that the norms regarding Ownership, Net worth, Corporate Governance etc for WSPs for accreditation with the National Multi-Commodity Exchanges (NMCEs) shall be as follow..."" FMC said.
 
 As per the draft rules, a WSP should have a minimum net worth of Rs 5 crore for providing warehousing services for single commodity and Rs 10 crore for multiple commodities.
 
 The promoter of the WSP should be in the warehousing business for at least three years. He should be of ""repute"" and have ""credible market standing"".
 
 WSPs should furnish security deposit of about two per cent for the value less than or equal to Rs 250 crore of the goods stored in the warehouses, three per cent for the value of Rs 250-500 crore and five per cent for above the value of Rs 500 crore of goods.
 
 ""A daily monitoring of the security deposits vis-a-vis the value of the commodity stored needs to be done so as to ensure that the minimum stipulated security deposits is always maintained with the exchange,"" FMC said.
 
 It is necessary that WSPs should be adequately capitalised to carry on the activity in compliance with all conditions as may be prescribed from time to time, it said.
 
 The exchange may ask for additional security deposit like bank guarantee from approved bank, fixed deposit receipt, cash or other forms of liquid security deposit as may be deemed acceptable by exchange, it added.
 
 On corporate governance norms, FMC said that a WSP should preferably be a corporate body with a professional management team.
 
 ""The WSP should ensure that the ownership and management is separate and an arm's length relationship is maintained with promoter/promoter group entities/relatives of the promoters, and the major suppliers and major customers of these entities,"" the FMC said.
 
 The WSP should set up a number of committees to oversee its operations as may be prescribed by the exchange subject to the condition that there should always be an audit committee of the WSP comprising of independent professionals.
 According to the draft rules, a WSP should have a 'Customer Grievances Cell' to handle customer complaints and should take proactive steps to resolve customer related issues. 

 The exchanges should have a 'Know Your Depositor Policy' which needs to be complied with by a WSP. 

 FMC also said that the WSP should ensure that there is no direct conflict of interest with the interests of the exchange and the depositors/lawful owners of goods. 

 ""WSPs/owners/relatives shall not be allowed to trade on any Exchange. For this purpose, the definition of 'relative' shall be as provided under the Companies Act, 2013,"" it said. 

 For accreditation purpose, a WSP should have sound facilities and infrastructure to store commodities. It should have insurance cover for stored commodities and comply with the provisions of the exchange's rules, regulations and by-laws, besides various central and state laws. 

 ""The exchanges are directed to ensure compliance of the above norms while accrediting the WSPs,"" the FMC said."

Vijay Bhambwani: It is hard to ignore the slide that all of the stocks in the space have witnessed.

Hot Stock: Brokerages expect sharp gains in Larsen & Toubro,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hot-stock-brokerages-expect-sharp-gains-in-larsen-toubro/articleshow/19358601.cms,m.economictimes.com,Hot Stock: Brokerages expect sharp gains in Larsen & Toubro,"MUMBAI: Infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro has become a blue-eyed stock-pick of brokerages. JP Morgan has upgraded its rating on the stock to 'overweight'. Last month, CLSA and Goldman Sachs also had upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ following its underperformance and hopes of pick-up in orders from the middle-east. 

 Not disappointing the brokerages, the company has been lately bagging big orders. After bagging Rs 5,689-crore EPC contract for Supercritical Power Plant in Rajasthan, the company’s construction arm secured AED 943.11 million Abu Dhabi Airport order today. L&T Construction also bagged orders worth Rs 3,700 crore in March, 2013. 

 According to JP Morgan, the company has managed to surprise with order inflow in weak environment. It is best positioned to benefit from capex revival and is well geared to tap the international opportunity. The brokerage has a price target of Rs 1,650 on the stock. 

 “L&T has been pre-qualified for several large projects in the middle-east transportation sector. The opportunities include Doha metro, Riyadh metro and freight corridor for Etihad rail. Financial bids for some packages have already been submitted. L&T has also been pre-qualified for a large road order in Muscat. We have built in a 25 per cent Y-o-Y growth in international orders for FY14 to Rs 187 billion,” the CLSA report had said. 

 It sees the stock hitting 1,750 in next 12-months. 

 Goldman Sachs sees limited downside risk in the stock making it risk-reward favorable on the basis of a robust order book (over 2X forward revenue coverage) providing revenue visibility and a declining interest rate regime. It has a target price of Rs 1,710 on L&T. 

 “If we strip out other businesses from the current price, the standalone business appears to be trading at a 1-yr forward P/E of 12.1X (ex- subs dividends), which is at a significant discount to its 3-year historical valuation of 20X. We believe this is attractive as we expect the company to generate a standalone ROIC of 22 per cent in FY14E,” it added. 

 The recent movement in the stock price has also made technical analysts to take a bullish trading call on the stock. 

 “On a short term basis, the stock RSI (14) is giving a divergence along with an exit from oversold region indicating stronger price moves to the upside. The stock has held its Rs 1,309 levels over the last 9 months and is expected to see commited demand at current price level. L&T has seen some long buildup along with possibility of shorts exiting the counter as per options data,” said Sahil Kapoor, analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services. 

 He has advised traders to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,420, keeping a stop loss below Rs 1,330 for a target of Rs 1,560. 

 Manav Chopra, Technical Analyst, Nirmbal Bang sees the stock touching a target of Rs 1,525-1,540 in next 2-3 weeks. 

 “The stock has been in a rising channel pattern since December’11 and the recent decline has taken support at the lower end of the channel. The RSI has declined near the support range and has formed a probable double bottom pattern which has been confirmed by an uptick in the indicator. There is also a probable double bottom pattern on daily price chart and positive divergence in RSI which is a positive signal and indicates an upside in the near term,” he said. 

 At 12:50 p.m.; the stock was at Rs 1,413, down 0.62 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 1,427 and a low of Rs 1,405.60 in trade today."

Housing finance is no brainer.There is a huge growth you are seeing. Managements come out with guidance of 20-25% growth that they are anticipating. In the NBFC segment these two can be looked at. 

 
ET Now: Would you bet on the tried and tested like Gruh Finance etc. which are trading at premium valuations? Or would you go in for the ones which have not moved at all, say GIC or even LIC Housing Finance? The Can Fin Homes etc have not really moved as much as a Gruh Finance or an HDFC have moved?  

 
Ajay Bagga: You can look at either of those sections. Overall housing finance NBFC should do well. The market leaders of course stay at the top. But there are people who are able to lent to affordable segments so look at the distribution strength and even smaller companies can be looked at."

 ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Mutual Funds, Reliance Mutual Fund, SBI Life, Birla Mutual Fund, Tata Mutual Fund, Axis Bank and Aviva were the prominent investors in the QIP, according to people close to the development. 

 The issue has been priced at Rs 137 per share, an 8.6 per cent discount to the stock’s Thursday close of Rs 150.05 on the BSE. IDFC had fixed a floor price of Rs 143.70 per share. The sale is being done to comply with a Reserve Bank of India rule that mandates maximum foreign shareholding of 49 per cent in a private sector bank. 

 “We saw investor interest to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore,’’ said a banker with knowledge of the development. “The institution that needs only about Rs 850 crore to adhere to the Reserve Bank of India requirement to reduce foreign holding to below 50 per cent has decided to retain Rs 1,000 crore.’’ The IDFC spokesperson was not available for comment.

Indians on spending spree: Time to nibble at discretionary stocks,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indians-on-spending-spree-time-to-nibble-at-discretionary-stocks/articleshow/49192923.cms,m.economictimes.com,Indians on spending spree: Time to nibble at discretionary stocks,"NEW DELHI: Amid confusing signs on the health of the domestic economy, September auto sales data sent out a bold signal: Indians want to spend more.
 
 Two-wheeler volumes barely grew in the pre-festive month, but Royal Enfield maker Eicher Motors posted 59 per cent year-on-year growth, selling 44,491 units against 28,020 units sold a year ago. Enfield models with up to 350cc engine capacity grew 63 per cent to 40,280 units from 24,662, while models with more than 350cc engine capacity sold 25 per cent more at 4211 units against 3358 units a year ago.
 
 India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki reported better volume growth in Ciaz hybrid and S-Cross than in the mini-car and compact car segments. Hyundai saw better volume growth in i20 and Creta than other models. Honda sold more units of Amaze and City than Brio or Jazz.
 
 The fineprint: the discretionary part of the consumption story is beginning to gain traction. The middle class Indian is finally loosening his purse strings, growing more confident and comfortable as he has about income growth, job security and falling inflation. So, he wants to spend more, eat out more and travel more.
 
 With inflation on a steady decline, consumer confidence in the economy seems to have risen gradually following a series of adrenalin-boosting steps by the new government and the recent rate cut by the RBI.
 
 That should be a good reason for stock investors to start nibbling at the consumer discretionary basket, which earlier this week got a shot in the arm after the Reserve Bank of India cut the repo rate by a more-than-expected 50 basis points.
 
 RBI governor Raghuram Rajan was pretty candid about the fact that the central bank now wants to push consumption, which he said would be the only growth driver in the domestic economy in an environment of global economic slowdown, monetary tightening and currency headwinds.
 
 Rajan also said the forthcoming pay commission award, which is likely to come towards the end of the year and take effect from the first quarter of the next financial year, should work as a stimulus for the economy -- another signal that the central bank and policymakers are now betting on consumption to drive the early phase of revival in the domestic economy.
 
 Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO of Envision Capital, roots for the aspirational business theme. ""I think consumer discretionary is in a sweet spot,” he said. Shah likes Mahindra Holidays and the airlines stocks. “To us, even real estate is a consumer discretionary. If you have a real estate developer who is basically building residences and quality homes for middle income households, that is consumer discretionary for us.
 
 The second is something like Mahindra Holidays. The last two-three years have not been particularly good for the sector. I think the way we look at it, every Indian household who buys a car would potentially wants to go on a holiday,"" he told ET Now.
 
 Consumer discretionary comprises businesses that deal with products or services that are not necessities, and hence, linked mainly to urban consumers. A little risk exists here, though. Some astute investors figured out this opportunity quite early and have driven up many of these stocks such as Jubilant Foodworks, Page Industries to expensive levels. So investors need to be discrete here.
 
 ""Clearly, urban consumption is looking quite good because if you look at the three things happened to urban consumption, one clearly the lower inflation is helping them, more money has been saved in the pocket of consumer, lower fuel prices are actually helping them,"" says Vikram Kotak, Crest Capital and Investment.
 
 Ajay Tyagi, EVP and Fund Manager of UTI Mutual Fund, says the conditions are just right for discretionary spending and capital formation in the economy.
 
 ""All this while, we were waiting for inflation to cool down and cool off and consequently interest rates to come down. With both these things now becoming increasingly imminent I think that discretionary spending and capital formation should start sometime in the very near future and that should actually augur well for earnings growth,"" he told ET Now.
 
 ""There is a revival of confidence in a few sectors which are helping urban consumption to pick up. Rural consumption is a little down, but urban consumption remains a good theme, which you buy through an auto or you buy through discretionary or you buy through the white goods,"" Crest Capital’s Kotak told ET Now.
 
 Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President of Sharekhan, likes INOX Leisure, Satyam Multiplexes and Pantalook Fashion. ""We think they fit into our overall theme of urban discretionary consumption, which is a bet one can really look at. The other big choice is Pantaloon Fashion and Retail. ""We think there is going to be a merger of that into Aditya Birla Fashions by December and that company would be renamed and listed again in December and there is going to be a good unlocking of value there as well."""
Infosys' stock to really pick up post restructuring: Manish Sonthalia,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/infosys-stock-to-really-pick-up-post-restructuring-manish-sonthalia/articleshow/33765555.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys' stock to really pick up post restructuring: Manish Sonthalia,"In a chat with ET Now, Manish Sonthalia, Sr. VP & Head – Equity Portfolio Management Services, Motilal Oswal Asset Management, shares his views on Infosys. 
 
 
ET Now: Not a table thumping number but clearly much above what the street or most bullish analyst were betting on? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: 2990 is a huge beat given the sentiments surrounding that stock. It is way beyond street estimates as far as the Q4 numbers were concerned.
 
 
ET Now: 2990 prima facie the numbers were looking strong, we do not have details on whether it is a tax ride back or whether it is a forex gain? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: I do not think you are going to see a major variation in the margins because not too much of a volume growth would have happened in the fourth quarter. We have to see the margin picture what sort of a forex gain or loss has come in and what sort of a taxation rate have they applied so all these details would be important.
 
 
ET Now: The FY15 guidance is out 7 per cent to 9 per cent, this is the most important number, it is not way out of what analyst were expecting but 7 per cent to 9 per cent is not bad but in line with the most optimistic estimate for FY15? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: They have managed to hold on to the expectation of brokerages' estimates so if they are between 7 per cent to 9 per cent the stock would not react negatively.
 
 
ET Now: NASSCOM has indicated that they expect the Indian IT industry to grow at a run rate of about 12 per cent to 14 per cent, Infosys has given a guidance of 7 per cent to 9 per cent so Infosys clearly has indicated that they would grow at a run rate which is lower than the industry average why should anybody be happy that is a bad news? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: They have a lot of restructuring to do, they are rationalising costs, you may want to sell the stock now and buy when the company has got restructured and then jump into the stock because it is a quality name. But whether you want to live through this or not depends upon your understanding about the company and what they have been doing.
 
 They are doing all the right things now, the leadership has been revamped, they would be working on sales effectiveness and delivery productivity. In the next two years hopefully this is the bottom part of the growth that you would be seeing in Infosys. Post restructuring may be this stock will really pick up and this company will get revamped which they have missed out and where TCS has scored.
 
 
ET Now: Infosys has some specific issues. At a time when HCL Tech, TCS or Tech Mahindra are growing at a run rate which is much higher than the industry average, why settle for Infosys where we know the path is going to be volatile? 

 
Manish Sonthalia: Dividend payout ratio has a very big bearing on PE multiples. If we are looking at a 40% payout ratio given that dividend yield of the market as a whole always remain between 1.5% and 2%, 15-16 prices to earning multiple is not expensive. We are looking at the bottom end of the valuation range for Infosys where things are only going to look up. 

 The stock prices do not move looking at the past, they move looking into the future and things are going to improve for Infosys and growth is going to converge towards TCS as far as 2016 is concerned."

 Large investors such as LIC, Arisaig Singapore, Aberdeen and Commonwealth Bank of Australia - whose combined holding in the company is 6.58 per cent -refrained from selling shares amid brokers lowering earnings forecast and the market fearing a setback for the brand. 

 Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, has increased stake fivefold to 98,606 shares from 18,176 shares, ac cording to Bloomberg data. Local institutions such Axis and Bajaj Allianz also increased holding in the stock. 

 A closer look at trading data shows that between mid that between midMay and mid-June trading of Nestle India stock intensified. There was unusual volatility and hectic intraday trading during that period when average delivery of shares dropped to less than 40 per cent compared with 80 per cent in the past one year while number of trades surged 10 fold. 

 There are fundamental as wel as technical reasons for owning Nestle shares. “Nestle offers sharp brand positioning, strong urban distribution and exceptional supply chain. Hence, a sharp fall in share price attracted a lot of long-term in vestors,“ said a domestic fund manager on condition of anonymity. 

 He said that the Maggi controversy would induce the company to reth ink its strategy on margins over volume growth. The volume growth in the past three years came down to 9 per cent as against a historical average of 14 per cent. 'Buy' rating on the stock has increased to 29 per cent in July 2015 as against 19 per cent in January 2015. 

 After the Maggi controversy, Jefferies, a broker, released a `buy' report with a target price of Rs 7,025 while Credit Suisse upgraded its rating on Nestle India to 'neutral' from `underperformer' for the first time since December 2012. Strong business model and fair visibility of earnings valued on discounted cash flow (DCF) backed the outlook. But it's difficult to buy the stock in bulk due to low liquidity and low floating stock. 

 While this raises the impact cost of buying the stock, it's an indicator that there's room for appreciation."

Though the first quarter saw a year-on-year rise of 27% in fuel expenses, and there was an imposition of additional charges at the Delhi Airport, Jet Airways reported a modest net profit of Rs 36 crore after five quarters of loss.
 
 
Sustainable future: The consensus analyst rating has jumped to 3.57 from 2.57 in a month because it is believed that the factors which led the company to put up a good performance in the first quarter will continue. Besides, the continuing problems of Kingfisher Airlines and Air India should help Jet Airways improve its position.
 
 
Internal improvement: The good performance is the result of effort on the part of the management. The repositioning of its no-frills brands—discontinuation of the Jetlite brand and merger with the upscale JetKonnect brand—has helped it generate a 50% yield, which is revenue per passenger km, an improvement for Jetlite. The closure of non-profitable international routes also improved the international load factor by 580 bps (y-o-y). Jet Airway’s efforts to improve ancillary revenues, reduce operating costs through route nationalisation and contract renegotiation are yielding results.
 
 
  
Debt reduction: The management plans to reduce the debt burden by $400-500 million in 2012-13 with the cash generated from operations as well as from the sale and leaseback of aircraft. In 2012-13, it plans to raise $180 million in this way. During the quarter, Jet Airways completed the sale and leaseback of two aircraft, generating Rs 52 crore, and plans to do the same with 8-9 more aircraft in the next couple of quarters.
 
 Given the favourable domestic market environment, analysts feel that a debt reduction of $250-300 million is achievable.
 
 
Exercise caution: The improving fundamentals is expected to result in re-rating. However, investors should not ignore the key risks involved. The current threats include a further increase in ATF prices, with the Brent crude already jumping back to $112 levels, and depreciation in rupee.
 
 
Selection methodology: We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating in the past month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weightages to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell).
 
 Any improvement in consensus rating indicates that the analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks that have been covered by at least 10 analysts."

 In a notification issued on Wednesday, the RBI said, “Nominated banks are now permitted to import gold on consignment basis. All sale of gold domestically will, however, be against upfront payments. Banks are free to grant gold metal loans. 

 Aiming to tame the then widening current account deficit (CAD), the central bank in August 2013 had prohibited imports of gold coins and medallions besides restricting inbound shipments of the metal.

However, the Delhi-based company will look at such an option only after completion of an ongoing expansion at its paper and pulp facilities in India, chief finance officer, V Kumaraswamy, told ET. 
  
  At 10:32 am, shares of JK Paper were trading 0.40% up at Rs 49.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  ""We can look at setting up a pulp mill in Taiwan or Indonesia or the Philippines, and bring the pulp back to India as it's difficult to make pulp here,"" said Mr Kumaraswamy. It would currently cost between 1,000-1,200 crore to build a 200,000-300,000 tonne pulp mill overseas, he added. 
  
  Pulp, the crucial input for making paper and viscose staple fibre, is mostly imported by Indian companies as local laws relating to growing trees for pulp are stringent. 
  
  Companies are not allowed to directly own forests and can only support farmers who will grow the trees under the so-called farm forestry scheme. This has prompted Indian companies such as Ballarpur Industries, India's largest paper making company and the Aditya Birla group, to go overseas for acquiring pulp capacity. 
  
  While JK Paper has some pulp capacity of its own, it is spending 1,653 crore to build a new pulp mill with capacity 215,000 tonnes and expanding paper capacity by 165,000 tonnes."

ET Now: What is the first stock on your radar?
 
 
Ashish Maheshwari: The two stocks that I like are among the top five in the industry where they operate. Both are available at very good price/earnings multiples and have shown consistent performance in past.
 
 Among them, the first is Kwality. It is India's third largest private sector dairy processor after Nestle India and Britannia Industries.
 
 This particular company is already processing 3 million litre milk per day and it already has six processing plants. Recently, company carried out one expansion plan. The plan is going to be operational in this quarter. After this, they are going to make butter, cheese, ghee and flavoured milk from these plants.
 
 With this, like they are also expanding their brand 'Dairy best' in northern Indian market, I am expecting topline to increase by almost Rs 1,000-crore in this particular segment once this plant is commissioned. From there, they are going to cater mainly to the retail side of the market, where the Ebitda margins are pretty high. In past also company has performed consistently. If you see last four years, the topline grew at a CAGR of almost 35 per cent.
 
 The bottomline has been consistently growing at 22 per cent plus. I am expecting that in this particular year, company can report an EPS of almost Rs 10. Going forward, it will be around Rs 12 in FY17, when this plant is operational. The stock is one of the cheapest plays in the dairy sector."

Benchmark indices have witnessed their best period in the past 100 days after the NDA government took charge on 26 May, 2014.

Both the Sensex and the Nifty have managed to hit fresh record highs almost on a daily basis. The Sensex conquered the fresh peak of 27,000, while the Nifty breached 8,100 levels in trade on Tuesday.

Tuesday marked the 100th day since Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s 14th Prime Minister. The S&P BSE Sensex has rallied nearly 9 per cent since then.

Most of the stocks, which have rallied so far in the year 2014, are from economy-linked sectors. So, stocks in auto, consumer durable and capital goods sector have seen major heavy weight buying.

Considering the fact that most of the stocks have already rallied so far in the year 2014, are there any multi-bagger opportunities left in the market? Yes, say analysts.

First, let’s discuss what are multi-baggers. A multi-bagger is a stock where one’s investment appreciates by multiple times. This is the term mostly used to describe those stocks which have the potential to report explosive growth over a period of time.

“Multi-baggers are stocks which give you returns which are multiples of your investment amount. This is a terminology derived from baseball where each base covered is a bag,” said Dr. Vikas Gupta, Executive Vice President, Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd.

“It is something like a ‘run’ in cricket terminology. A home run with 4 bases is equivalent to a ‘sixer’. This was a term coined by Peter Lynch, one of the most amazing fund managers and a big baseball fan,” he added.

What should investors look in a company to know that it could be a multi-bagger in the coming future? According to analysts, investors should avoid taking exposure in penny stocks and companies with inconsistent track record.

Look for companies with stable business models which can generate strong cash flow even in a downturn and should have the potential to perform really well under good economic conditions that one can expect in the next 3-5 years, say analysts.

In general, stocks, which had fundamental issues in the past, could be the potential multi-baggers.

“These kind of stocks could have lower than industry price multiples such as price/earnings, price/sales, etc. PEG ratio could also be a better idea in picking a value based multi-bagger,” said Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services.

“A fundamentally sound under-priced stock would always reflect less than 1.0 PEG ratio, because of continued rise in EPS and slow growth in price. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock might be undervalued given its bottom-line performance,” he added.

We spoke to various analysts and here’s the list of their stocks which could become multi-baggers in the coming years:


				
Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities

Cox & Kings provides a multi-bagger opportunity for long-term investors as the Budget 2014 contained significant announcements for the tourism sector as the government looked set to promote the tourism industry as indicated in its election manifesto.

	 
For instance, e-visas facility will be introduced at 9 major airports, 5 tourist circuits on specific themes will be set up, there would be development of more airports under the PPP mode in tier-II and tier-III cities, there is a Rs 1000-crore outlay for improvement of rail connectivity in North-East, among others.

Raamdeo Agrawal, MD & Co-Founder, MOFSL

Where you have global advantage, it could be either pharma or it could be tech again. So we are bullish on companies like Infosys and TCS. May be Sun Pharma, may be some other company, may be even a telecom company, a Bharti kind of company can become very large in the next 10 years.

Dr. Vikas Gupta, Executive Vice President, Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd

We think currently NMDC, Coal India, Baja Auto, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tata Motors, Hero etc. are some of the multi-baggers. Tata Motors might have high debt but that is in low-interest rate foreign currency and adequately supported by foreign currency earnings. Others are all zero-debt and some are sitting on large amounts of cash, that can be invested in growth opportunities, both organic and inorganic.

Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services

There are certain stocks which have the potential to become multi-baggers, such as Apollo Tyres, Redington India, L&T Finance Holdings, Idea Cellular, etc.

Ambareesh Baliga, Market Expert

Shipping is one sector where we could see a multi-bagger going ahead and when I say a multi-bagger, it could take possibly two to three years; but, that is one space where I think one should look at buying.

Very clearly, if you see the last results, SCI was a clear turnaround story and it is quoting at a discount to its book value. The book value is close to 110.

So this is a stock which one can look at buying at Rs 60. At least in the medium term, we could see levels of about Rs 85 to Rs 88, but then again if you are able to hold on for the next three to four years, it should more than double.

Avinnash Gorakssakar, Head of Research, Mintdirect.com

In the midcap pharma space, we like Indoco Remedies. They had very strong numbers in Q1, plus the kind of visibility the company is talking, they are saying that possibly in the next 12 to 18 months, they should be targeting a top line of close to Rs 1500 crore, which is very-very significant.

My sense is even from the current levels both from the earnings traction point of view and the kind of events, they are working on some molecules. My guess is probably a price target of Rs 325-350 over the next one year.

Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher

Voltas is one stock which has run up. Over the next three to four years, this stock can certainly be a multibagger from the current levels.

Federal Bank is a stock which probably in three to four years can go up two or three times.

L G Balakrishnan is another stock which is really doing pretty well and though it has had a good run up, it still has sufficient scope to give above average returns.

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: Media is a very large basket I know but the earnings have started to pick up. You look at Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd from the exhibition space or Dish TV India Ltd for that matter from the distribution space and their commentary for the quarter two has sounded off like it is going to be a promising quarter and we also hear ad rates picking up, which would probably augur well for print and television companies too. Are you bullish on the space at large? 

 
Taher Badshah: It is an interesting space to watch out for in 2015, especially if FMCG companies and even auto companies for that matter actually start utilising some of the savings that they have on raw materials towards more ad expenses. We are also probably going to see a lot of sporting events over the course of the year. So that is something which would also augur well from the point of viewership etc. The only challenge of course for these companies is that they are also investing simultaneously in newer properties and channels which probably could lead to margin dislocation in the near term. So that could probably be one of the headwinds which it encounters and it remains a reasonably competitive space altogether. So the next 12 months could probably be better compared to what the previous 12 months could be in terms of the earnings profile."
"Mid-cap pharma stocks can return 20% in 2014, say analysts",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mid-cap-pharma-stocks-can-return-20-in-2014-say-analysts/articleshow/28336330.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Mid-cap pharma stocks can return 20% in 2014, say analysts","NEW DELHI: Despite headwinds from the USFDA, pharma stocks have been in favour due to the defensive nature of their business, healthy export performance and of course a weaker rupee.

Pharma companies for the second quarter of the financial year 2014 declared a mixed bag results. The recent market rally in the pharma sector has materially reduced the valuation gap that existed between the historical multi-year average valuation multiple and current valuation.

Following the past two quarters of weakness, analysts at top brokerage firms expect some good performance in India as implementation of DPCO 2013 concludes, among other reasons. Elara Capital expects domestic pharma business to rise by 9 per cent for the quarter.

Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD & Co Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, is positive on the entire pharma sector. Although he identifies two set of companies in the pack - one, export-oriented firms like Sun Pharma and the Ciplas of the world and Glenmark and all.

""This is one set of companies which are riding onto the Indian generic revolution all over the world,"" he says. The second set of companies which would ride the wave are domestic pharmas which have very large opportunities, he adds.

Agrawal is of the view that the entire pharma pack, particularly the large ones which have export as well as domestic operations, will see very interesting times.

Elara Capital in a report said that they expect revenues to grow at a robust 20 per cent, driven by continued strong performance by Sun Pharma.

Excluding Sun, revenue growth is expected to remain moderate at 14 per cent.

For the upcoming quarter (October-December), the brokerage firm expects weak earnings for GSK Pharma owing to price cuts and trade union strikes, with pressure on revenue and margin.

Performance for Ranbaxy is likely to be weak in the absence of new launches and pressure in the emerging markets.

However, overall, Elara Capital remains overweight on the pharma sector as the companies are well positioned to take advantage of the global generic opportunity, against the backdrop of a patent cliff and rich ANDA pipeline.

This, coupled with recovery in India, will drive earnings and stock performance. In the near term, Elara Capital expects mid-cap stocks to outperform large-cap peers.

At the current level, Elara Capital believes that large-cap valuations offer limited scope for a strong upside. In the mid-cap space, we like Torrent Pharma and Divi’s Labs. It maintains Dr Reddy’s as its top pick in the large-cap space.

Ipca Laboratories (Ipca), Aurobindo Pharma (Aurobindo), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (Sun) and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Glenmark) breached their respective three-year and five-year historical average multiples recently on the back of a strong show in the export markets.

On the other hand, players like Dishman Pharma (Dishman), Cadila Healthcare (Cadila), Cipla and Divi's Laboratories (Divi's), which have yet to catch up with their historical average multiples in spite of a healthy growth outlook, can perform relatively better going ahead.

	 
“While the outlook for the overall sector remains strong, we observe players having a presence in niche segments like injectibles, ophthalmic solutions, hormones, nasal spray, sterile solutions, complex products in oncology space, and high-technology new drug delivery systems (NDDS), have yet to gain a premium over players having a presence in vanilla generics like tablets and capsules,” Sharekhan said in a note.

Owing to better growth visibility, the brokerage firm has introduced estimates for FY16 and rolling over valuation to the estimated earnings in case of Aurobindo, Cadila and Divi's.

They have maintained their ‘buy’ recommendation on Aurobindo (with a revised price target of Rs 470) considering the stock is available at a deep discount as against other large-cap players despite having rapidly built up a strong pipeline in a niche space.

Apart from that, Cadila is a strong ‘buy’ (with a revised price target of Rs 988) and also Divi's, with a revised price target of Rs 1,450.

Sharekhan bets on Cadila, Cipla and Divi's as top picks as these are yet to catch up with their respective historical averages due to certain issues, mostly temporary.

Here is a list of 11 stocks along with their target prices for the next one year from Elara Capital:

New launches help Garware Wall Ropes cast its net wider,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/new-launches-help-garware-wall-ropes-cast-its-net-wider/articleshow/34129801.cms,m.economictimes.com,New launches help Garware Wall Ropes cast its net wider,"Garware Wall Ropes is poised to grow faster in the coming years with the growing acceptance of some of its new products in the overseas aquaculture industry as well as in the domestic agriculture market. The company's valuations look attractive, if it can achieve its goals.
 
 ""We expect to grow 15-20% annually over the next three years,"" said Vayu Garware, chairman and managing director of the company. ""Our goal is to reach Rs 1,000 crore turnover in FY17.""
 
 This will be a significant spurt for the company, which grew at an average annualised growth rate of 8% in the past five years and clocked a turnover of Rs 639 crore in the 12-month period ended December 2013. The optimism stems from the popularity of some of its recent launches.
 
 The company is a leading global player in heavy-duty fishing nets for mechanised fishing and has developed low maintenance cages, anti-predator, anti-bird systems for aquaculture business, which is being increasingly accepted by customers.
 
 Aquaculture, also known as aqua farming, is the farming of aquatic organisms, such as fish, under controlled conditions, and is different from commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Similarly, the company had launched covering nets and sheets aimed at domestic agriculture for protecting farm produce from elements like excessive sunlight or hailstorm as well as from birds. They, too, are fast gaining traction.
 
 ""Products aimed at aquaculture in the exports market and agriculture in the domestic market will drive revenue growth,"" said Garware. According to him, nets and solutions supplied to the mechanised fishing and aquaculture industries together contribute half the company's revenues.
 
 In the process, the company's operating profit margins, too, will grow, thanks to its ongoing measures to curtail costs and also economies of scale on production ramp-up. The company's operating profit margins remained stable between 10% and 11% of net sales in the last five years.
 
 Garware Wall Ropes makes a range of products from threads, ropes, nets to coated fabrics, which are used in heavy-duty, specialised applications like towing ships, mechanised fishing and aquaculture, nets used in sports like tennis or soccer, geo-synthetics to prevent soil erosion or rock fall protection. The company's sports nets are used in tennis grand slams, football World Cups as well as during Olympics.
 
 The company carries nearly 107 crore of debt, and has a debt-equity ratio of 0.4. Over 75% of the debt is for working capital. The company has a long history of paying dividend, and has a dividend yield of 3.5% at present. The company recently reduced its capital 7.7% under a buyback arrangement. The scrip is valued at 6.5 times its earnings for the past 12 months and price-to-book-value of 0.6."

ET Now: Since the entire oil and gas space has taken a bit of backseat really post the budget, is it a good time to accumulate if one has missed out on the rally? 

 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay: Absolutely correct. In fact, this is exactly what we have been advising our clients. This is one space where there will be a complete re-rating once the gas price revision announcement comes. Look it is a matter of time. The government has kept a dead line of 30th September and we believe it will happen even before that. 

 Now whatever happens whether we go to that magic number of 8.4 or we settle somewhat below that at 6.8 or whatever is being talked about, that will straight way help these companies. 

 The second issue which we all must remember is the government is committed and they are on the path of gradual market linked pricing of all the petroleum products. 

 These steps help in a big way the oil marketing companies and over a period of time the entire, the burden of subsidy and the uncertainty pertaining to the subsidy will disappear and these companies being fundamentally strong otherwise will be an investor’s preferred choice for investment very shortly."
OMCs brave market volatility;surge to 52-week high on positive outlook,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/omcs-brave-market-volatilitysurge-to-52-week-high-on-positive-outlook/articleshow/47924900.cms,m.economictimes.com,OMCs brave market volatility;surge to 52-week high on positive outlook,"MUMBAI: The oil marketing companies (OMCs) held the fort when the Nifty fell from all-time high to sub 8,000 levels recently. These stocks continued to consolidate and are trading at 52-week high levels today. 

 The sharp rally in OMC counters was triggered by robust 4QFY15 results aided by abnormally high marketing margins and strength in refining margins. 

 ""OMCs have had an exceptional run in the past two years (up 99-347 per cent from August 2013 lows, vs Nifty rising 50 per cent). However, the benefits of reforms, benign oil prices and strength in refining do not seem fully factored in. We estimate steep 53-134 per cent earnings growth in FY16F, with IOC (the laggard so far) leading the pack,"" said Nomura report. 

 The brokerage house is of the view that market concerns on government of India’s interference in pricing / subsidies have now nearly vanished. 

 ""OMC stocks should be driven more by fundamentals and the scope for further re-rating remains,"" it said. 

 Nomura has raised IOC’s target price to Rs 515 from Rs 385 earlier, HPCL to Rs 935 from Rs 675 earlier and BPCL to Rs 1055 from Rs 810 earlier. 

 Since decontrol, OMCs have been recording super-normal margins on diesel, averaging Rs 1.8/litre, says Edelweiss report. 

 Diesel and petrol prices have been revised effective from July 1, 2015 — diesel prices have been cut by INR0.7/litre and petrol by INR0.3/litre. Oil price has extended its steady decline having corrected ~2 per cent since the previous fortnight. 

 ""Based on our global case studies, we had highlighted that marketing margins are poised to rise by as much as ~150 per cent and earnings of OMCs (HPCL, BPCL and IOCL) could double over the next 3 years,"" the report added. 

 However Kotak Institutional Equities is advising investors to be cautious in OMCs pack after stellar rally. 

 According to analysts at the brokerage house, marketing margins for these companies have moderated and refining margins are unlikely to sustain at such high levels. 

 ""We advise caution on the rich valuation of HPCL (REDUCE). We fine-tune estimates/target price for OMCs and retain ADD on BPCL and IOCL, though we will look for better entry points,"" the report said."
"Once Axis Bank crosses 1250, strength will return: Rajat Bose",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/once-axis-bank-crosses-1250-strength-will-return-rajat-bose/articleshow/7424356.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Once Axis Bank crosses 1250, strength will return: Rajat Bose","What is the call on Axis Bank?
   
  
  Rajat Bose: It is currently ruling at 1241 and Axis Bank generally tends to be a market performer when you look at from the short term perspective and the fact that it is trading below 15 points from yesterday’s close does not mean that it has become weak. I would consider weakness signs facing only if it were to fall below 1234 and sustain there. Otherwise, Axis Bank can stage a pullback and once it trades above 1250, once again that strength would be clearly visible. So nothing much to worry about as such as of now.
   
  
  What about the index?
  
   
  
  Rajat Bose: If you look at the option build up, the kind of open interest build up in the options segment, only now we are witnessing that 5500 calls might have added about 4 lakh shares additional. While there is some addition even inputs as well but it appears that the key level that I was watching for that was 5476 and now that it is holding out, I am not ruling out recovery but at the same time, I was not really expecting it to sustain below 5476 and the next stop was 5463 which happens to me the day’s low. Mind you if 5476 is not held out on a closing basis, then bulls would actually become much weaker once again and selling pressure might mount. 
  
  But given the build up that we have seen in puts in the last couple of days and also recovering in falls, it does not worry me so much right at this point in time, of course short sellers are bit aggressive at 5500 levels. So that could put some pressure at 5505 level for the Nifty but let’s wait as to how the day and the week comes to a close. I would say the nascent rally has not yet completed. It would still have some headroom left.
   
  
  Jain Irrigation on the charts?
   
  
  Rajat Bose: It has already recovered to about 191 from a level close to about 150 a few trading sessions back and that was a vertical fall. So vertical falls generally tend to give a good bounce back and this is that bounce back that is happening and then between 200 and 210, you would see Jain Irrigation probably would be meeting a lot of supply pressure. It needs to be seen as to how it reacts to that selling pressure. If the stock sustains above 200 going forward, then it would be pretty good. Otherwise at least for the 6 long months there had been distribution on this stock and this stock for all practical purposes looks like a sell on rallies and I would not really suggest people to actually get into this stock and while this rally should be used to actually exit the counter."
ONGC has potential to double in next two years: Analysts,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ongc-has-potential-to-double-in-next-two-years-analysts/articleshow/40989785.cms,m.economictimes.com,ONGC has potential to double in next two years: Analysts,"MUMBAI: The decline in global crude oil prices and gradual diesel de-regulation exercise has come as a boon for oil & gas major ONGC.
 
 The oil ministry has proposed to rationalise the subsidy-sharing mechanism for state-run oil producers, a move that is expected to reduce the burden on ONGC and Oil India. The government is likely to cap ONGC and Oil India’s share of subsidy burden to 50 per cent each.
 
 According to reports, the ministry has proposed to consider OID (oil industry development) cess paid by ONGC and OIL as part of their subsidy share. In return, the companies would pay royalty to states on the full price of crude and not the discounted rate offered to government refiners.
 
 Analysts are of the view that such a move will be EPS accretive for ONGC over the next two years. It will also benefit the government to sell stake in the company through OFS route.
 
 ""If oil subsidy continues to fall as expected we think that ONGC-OIL would be better off under the 50 per cent:50 per cent subsidy sharing formula than under the prevailing subsidy formula or the Parikh committee formula assumed by us,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.
 
 ""Under the 50%:50% subsidy sharing formula ONGC-OIL’s subsidy would be lower and net oil price realization higher than assumed,"" the report said.
 
 ONGC and OIL give discounts to help state refiners cover part of their losses from selling diesel and kitchen fuels at government-capped rates. Over the years, this discount has risen from 30 per cent in 2008-09 to 48 per cent in 2013-14.
 
 At last count, the discount stood at $56 on a barrel of crude. In addition, the producers also paid $18-19 as Central and state levies on each barrel of oil. Against a minimum return of $65 a barrel required to provide money for future exploration, the companies have been taking home only $31 on a price of $105 per barrel.
 
 ""The big deal in ONGC is that, we have arguably a good and visionary government in power. If they do the things to ONGC that I am dreaming and imagining of, there is no reason why ONGC should not double from here as well. It is a question of what the government does,"" said Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
 
 Under the proposed 50:50 per cent subsidy sharing formula, ONGC’s EPS would get a good boost.
 
 According to BofA ML report, ONGC’s FY15-16E EPS would be 2-8 per cent higher under 50:50 per cent subsidy sharing formula than under Parikh committee formula.
 
 In a recent report, CLSA increased its weightage on ONGC in India’s model portfolio.
 
 ""Driven by a 59 per cent decline in oil subsidies over the next two years as diesel subsidies are eliminated, we see post-subsidy crude realisation for ONGC to rise from US$41/bbl to US$50/bbl, despite our assumption of 100 per cent subsidy burden for upstream names,"" the report said.
 
 ""This, along with the doubling of the domestic gas price, will ensure a 22 per cent EPS Cagr over two years. ONGC is our top pick in the state-owned spacewith a BUY rating and Rs 530 target based on 11x PE to core business,"" the report added.
 
 The brokerage has ‘Buy’ rating with a price target of Rs 530 on ONGC.

ET Now: Has your last declared portfolio changed or are you still running a portfolio which is largely inclined with exporters in the global theme? 

 
Vijai Mantri: We have reduced our IT exposure little bit. We were significantly overweight on IT and pharma, but now we are little less overweight on these sector. We continue to believe that these sectors will continue to deliver performance. 

 Rupee has come down from 62 levels to close to 61 levels or from 63-64 levels to 61 levels. But, most of the IT billing for last quarter happened around 57-58 levels. Even if the billing happened at Rs 60, it won't be a bad thing. We continue to believe that IT industry will continue to show visibility on the earnings. 

 On the other hand, a lot of cyclicals are available at multi-year low. But, the challenge is whether the next government form and whether they will start the reform. Even if they start the reform, it will take a while before we see the visibility on the balance sheet of these companies. 

 Right now, our focus would be to own cash rich companies and companies which have a more visibility on the earnings."

 The bourse ended the day with an increase of 793.31 points with the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index ending on 28,567.74 an increase of 2.86 per cent. 

 During the day the KSE 100 index at one stage crossed 1,102 points to The index rose much more rapidly today than it had fallen this past week with a 0.13 per cent or 36.92 point drop on Thursday landing the index at 27,774.43. 

 Financial analysts have put down the drop in the KSE index to the political uncertainty prevailing in the country due to the ongoing sit-ins by Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e -Insaaf and Tahirul Qadri's Pakistan Awami Tehreek in Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation. 

 The positive sentiment by investors can be put down to the announcement that the army was going to mediate and find a solution to the political crisis, one trader said. 

 Pakistan's economic outlook had improved since the government of business-friendly Nawaz Sharif came to power with foreign exchange reserves having doubled from $7 billion to $14 billion. 

 Earlier in July, ratings agency Moody's had also upgraded Pakistan's country outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' citing its improving external liquidity position and commitment to reforms."

 The contract for May delivery climbed as much as 2.2% to 2,795 ringgit ($854) a metric tonne on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level for the mostactive contract since September 2012, and was at 2,793 ringgit at 5:11 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures are set for an 9.2% gain this month. 

 Production in Malaysia dropped about 9% in the first 20 days of the month from the same period in January, said Paramalingam Supramaniam, a director at Pelindung Bestari, a Selangor-based broker, citing estimates from the Malaysian Palm Oil Association. Output fell to 1.51 million tonne last month and reserves shrank to 1.93 million tonne, Malaysian Palm Oil Board data show. The harvest is the lowest in January and February because of growing cycles. 

 “Lower inventories of between 1.7 million to 1.8 million tonne are expected due to the lower production this month,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “The cut to soybean crop estimates may increase dependency on palm oil, keeping stockpiles low.” 

 Output of soybeans, crushed to make an alternative oil, will be 4.4% less than earlier expected in South America after dry weather hurt crops in Brazil, according to Oil World. 

 Prices rose on speculation that an El Nino weather pattern can occur later this year, impacting palm oil production, said Hiro Chai, vice-president at CIMB Futures in Kuala Lumpur. The El Nino, which can parch Australia and parts of Asia while bringing rains to South America, may occur in the coming months, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said on Tuesday.

But, a slump in the intellectual property related business, which came on top of a solid growth in the previous quarter, pulled down the growth in the overall revenue. 

 Revenue rose by 2.2% to $69.9 million sequentially during the December quarter. The growth in the products engineering and platform solutions was 3.8%, making it the fourth consecutive quarter in which it exceeded 3% increase. 

 The other division that derives business from intellectual property (IP) related activities reported a sequential drop of 4.8% in revenue. Revenue from this division have been lumpy due to the nature of business which involves selling licenses and services for applications whose IP lies with the company. In the previous quarter, it had reported an increase of 37.4% following a drop of 12.4% in the June 2013 quarter. 

 Despite a moderation in the growth of the total revenue due to the slack in the IP business, the company’s operating margin expanded by 180 basis points to 21.7%. This was on account of lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. Cost optimisation and recovery of some of the revenue, which was provided for in the earlier quarters led to lower SG&A. Barring this, the company has not changed its SG&A strategy on a year-on-year basis, according to the chief operating officer Mritunjay Singh.

 On the first day of subscription, the state-owned company received subscriptions worth Rs 8,461 crore against the core issue size of Rs 100 crore, excluding an option to retain oversubscription up to Rs 600 crore mandated earlier by the government. The company is likely to close the issue on Tuesday, well before the scheduled closing date of October 9. 

 ""Two factors led to investor exuberance in the issue,"" said Vikram Dalal, managing director, Synergee Capital. ""Firstly, the PFC issue was finalised before the latest RBI rate cut and the reduction did not reflect in the pricing. Secondly, tax-free bonds issued in 2013-14 are now trading at a premium after the repo rate cut. Future tax-free issues would broadly offer 20-25 bps lower rates,"" he said. 

 Four categories of investors —retail, high net-worth individuals, corporates and qualified institutions — can invest in these bonds with 10-, 15-, and 20-year maturities subject to different rates. A retail investor can earn as high as 7.36 per cent, 7.52 per cent and 7.60 per cent for the three maturities, respectively. 

 The Reserve Bank of India slashed the benchmark rate by 50 basis points in its bi-monthly monetary policy on September 29. Since then, the benchmark bond yield has dipped by about 20-25 bps, pushing prices up. Retail investors have bid for Rs 2,069 crore against an upper investment limit of Rs 280 crore, while high net-worth individuals’ subscription to the issue is eight times more than the category limit of Rs 175 crore. 

 ""If we consider the shift in GSec yields, the coupon offered by PFC is quite attractive,"" said Deepak Panjwani, head - debt markets, GEPL Capital. ""This is an all-time record as investors showed tremendous appetite for PFC tax-free bonds."" 

 Eligible institutional borrowers’ bid was 22 times more than the Rs 70 crore limit for the category. A triple-A rated issuer can sell bonds to retail investors at a rate that is 55 basis points lower than similar maturity government bond yields, according to a circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes of the finance ministry on July 6. 

 The government has mandated that issuers would price tax-free bonds at 80 bps less than similar-maturity government bonds for institutional investors.

 ""Ebitda, at Rs 30.4 billion, was 8 per cent ahead of estimates mainly due to lower network operating costs and PAT was 16 per cent ahead of estimates with 3x jump in investment income,"" the report said.

Praj might bounce back if the market permits: Deepak Mohoni,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/market-trying-to-bounce-back-deepak-mohoni/articleshow/12001080.cms,m.economictimes.com,Market trying to bounce back: Deepak Mohoni,"
  In an interview with ET Now, Deepak Mohoni, Director, trendwatchindia.com shares his views about market outlook. 
  
  
  A rather quite day but you have a knack of picking up the possibility of activity in the latter half of the day, it is expiry today, you think that could happen?
   
  I am not a great subscriber to the idea that expiry affects the volatility very much. In fact as you can see today it is one of the lower volatility days. 
  
  Every contract has got the other side to it as well but coming to the market it does look like small recovery on the way. 
  
  Markets are trying to bounce back, at least select stocks have made a bounce back but there is a possibility we could see the swings in both directions. 
  
  Best strategy right now is stick to very short term trades, not even a four-five day swing trade but just a day trade or a overnight with tight stop losses and once some trend develops then again you can linked in the duration of the trades.

Excerpts:   ET Now: What is your call on Tata Motors? Still makes for a good buy even at the current levels given the kind of performance that we have seen in the quarterly numbers where JLR continues to surprise on the upside?  P Phani Sekhar: Tata Motors is all about JLR these days and standalone business will take at least one-and-a-half year to make any mark. JLR performance has been commendable. This time they surprised us on the margin front and considering the impressive line up of models that they have over the next one year or so and the demand that still looks buoyant especially for emerging geographies like China, there is no real cause for concern except what you have just reported that might not go down very well and I am not surprised if the stock is reacting negatively. But overall if the problem, and we all hope it will be contained, if it is contained, then I guess it is good for another 20% over the next one year or so and by that time you hope that the domestic CV cycle will turn and will ensure and will act as a buffer for whatever growth disappointment that is bound to come in JLR will come. So all in all, on the balance, among the large cap space, it is a decent bet."

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 37 points higher at 5861, indicating a higher opening on the domestic market. 

 The Nifty index ended its two-day winning streak on Monday and closed in the red as rupee depreciated against the US dollar following better than expected jobs data in the US. 

 Though the Nifty managed to recover losses intraday, but still ended with losses of 56 points. Daily chart indicates that, Nifty once again shutting shop below its 200- Days Simple Moving Average i.e. below 5830 levels. 

 “Every time Nifty manages to stage a strong comeback, the bears resumed their onslaught. Their pullback rally was just not good enough for the market to close in the green,” said Swati A. Hotkar, Technical Analyst at LKP Advisory. 

 “It looks like Nifty is playing with gaps and each time we gap-down by the end of the day we recover. So what is happening here is that this is a market that is not clearly going down substantially on bad news which is a positive sign,” she added. 

 We believe that Nifty is trading in the range of 5750-5950 i.e. 200 points range and me may get a smooth rally once it manages to come out from the range bound trading. 

 Hotkar is of the view that traders should hold on to their long positions with the strict stop loss of 5750 levels. 

 Indian rupee continued to weaken against the US dollar and hit a fresh all-time low on Monday. The rupee breached 61 to the dollar mark in opening trade itself following strong US non-farm payroll data on Friday. 

 Movement of rupee will be in focus as further depreciation may put markets under pressure. However, most experts are of the view that the currency does look oversold and tired at 61 levels. 

 “The momentum is still bearish and big voices on the street are calling rupee undervalued at current levels,” said Manisha Gupta, Editor -Currency and Commodities at ET Now. 

 “They are predicting Rs 70 per dollar plus kind of levels. If the forecasts are to be believed then brace for more pain in the rupee market and Indian equities as well,” she added. 

 Overnight, US stocks closed higher building on gains sparked by last week's robust employment report which suggested that economy is on the path of recovery. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 88.85 points, or 0.59 per cent, to end at 15,224.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 8.57 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 1,640.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 5.45 points, or 0.16 per cent, to close at 3,484.83. 

 Asian stocks edged higher but investors were still nervous over China's new drive to reform credit to restructure the economy. 

 ""China shares had their worst day in two weeks on Monday, after China's leadership laid out plans to ensure banks would support an economic rebalancing to efficient high-end manufacturing from industrial overcapacity and extravagant investment funded by cheap debt,"" Reuters reported. 

 Japan's Nikkei 225 index was trading 1.5 per cent higher at 14,326.17 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.6 per cent higher at 20,718.12. 

 South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.4 per cent higher at 1824.45. China's Shanghai index was trading 0.1 per cent higher at 1960.63."
Pre-market: Nifty seen opening higher on US Federal Reserve outlook,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/pre-market-nifty-seen-opening-higher-on-fomc-minutes-data/articleshow/21013017.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pre-market: Nifty seen opening higher on FOMC minutes data,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open higher on Thursday tracking Asian markets, which rallied after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said QE3 is likely to continue. 

 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting released on Wednesday highlighted that Fed will continue buying bonds until the labor market outlook improves substantially. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 89 points higher at 5895, indicating a higher opening on the domestic market. 

 The Nifty extended intraday fall in the afternoon and closed above 5,800 on Wednesday as traders booked profits in absence of supportive cues from European peers. 

 Nifty consolidated for the first half session in the narrow range of 5870-5850 off levels, but in the second half trading sessions bulls failed lost their grip and the index slipped towards its key support level of 5800. 

 “Daily Chart indicates that Nifty is hovering near the 200-DMA i.e. at 5830 levels. Overall the picture is not clear and the market is still going through a consolidation phase,” said Swati A. Hotkar, Technical Analyst at LKP Advisory. 

 Unfortunately, the Bank Nifty has not participated well which could act as a dampener. The index did tried to give some intraday buy signals, but failed to sustain above 11,500 levels on closing basis, she added. 

 Hotkar is of the view that unless and until Nifty doesn't come out from the trading range we may not get a smooth rally. As long as Nifty respects 5750 levels traders should maintain the positive bias. 

 The index has been consolidating in a narrow range for some time now, but analysts are of the view that the index will not break at the lower end of the range i.e. at 5750 levels. 

 “I would still not read into this as a weakness where we will break down off of 5750 and come down to 5550 or so. Tomorrow, the index is likely to rally towards 5850-5900,” said Sandeep Wagle, Founder & MD, APTART Technical Advisory Services in an interview with ET Now. 

 “However, a decisive move will only come when 5900 is broken on the upside or a 5750 is broken on the downside,” he added. 

 Overnight, US stocks ended flat but Ben Bernanke's comments sent U.S. stock index futures higher. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 8.68 points, or 0.06 percent, to end at 15,291.66. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index inched up just 0.30 of a point, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 1,652.62. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 16.50 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 3,520.76.

ET Now: What is the call on banking pack? 

 P Phani Sekhar: The private sector banks remain our favourite. However, after seeing the public sector banks’ numbers, we tend to believe that some of the stocks like say an Allahabad Bank or Dena Bank, which we have been liking for the last two quarters or so, may continue to do well. Especially considering the fact that stock like Allahabad Bank has corrected almost 30% in the last 1.5 months or so.
 
 Union Bank, if one can lay one’s hands on it at around 140-145 levels, the stock looks attractive from a longer term perspective because a large damage has been done from an asset quality perspective. Although, there might be more slippages but at least investors now have a firm handle on what kind of slippages and restructurings to expect, because a large bulk of it is behind us.
 
 So, now it is much easier to value these companies as compared to what it was, maybe a quarter back and valuations since then have corrected to around 0.7 or 0.8 times, it offers much more margin of safety. The dividend yields have cropped, have jumped up to 5% to 6% which is an added attraction. So all these combined, public sector banks might be a good bet from a 2 to 3-year perspective from these levels."

 ""It will help us in reducing our debt cost which is an important aspect for us ...Rs 6,000 crore is a significant debt for us, some of the things that we are trying to do is non-core asset monetisation,"" he said. 

 The company, so far, had an order-book position at Rs 11,000 crore. 

 ""For us our main market is global. That is the reason we are sometimes insulated from the market fluctuations here (India) because its unlikely that all markets simultaneously collapse,"" Chalasani said.

 Kalindee Rail rallied 19.9%, Kernex Microsystems rose 19.9%, Texmaco surged 19.3%, BEML jumped 19.3%, while Hind Rectifiers gained 17.5% at the BSE on Monday.

 ""Investment in railway infrastructure is an economic imperative; even a small increase in incremental capex will result in significant benefits,"" said Satish Kumar, analyst at Standard Chartered Securities, in a note to its clients. ""Our in-depth study and on-the-ground checks of the commonly ignored railway sector reveal a Rs 5 lakh-crore opportunity for companies,"" Kumar added.
 
 BJP and its allies enjoy a majority of 335 in the 543-member house, and Modi is unlikely to face much resistance in pushing reforms.
 
 Railway stocks are still about 70% below their life-time highs of late 2007 -- the peak of the previous bull run. However, investors stayed away from these stocks as the government did not make any major announcements in the last few years.
 
 ""The railway companies have not received any major orders for the last couple of years, and I hope this will change,"" said Sunil Jain, head of equity research at Nirmal Bang. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion has been pushing for FDI in railways since August last, and this is also seen as big trigger for these companies.

Anand Tandon: There is serious consolidation that has happened for all practical purpose around the four players now. Therefore we will be ending up paying a lot more for making calls. 

 It may not have happened immediately and whenever Reliance Jio actually rolls out their plans you may have some amount of stickiness on the price of way up because there will be an initial kind of fight for customers at least on the data side. 

 But aside from there the expenses are done, the uncertainty in terms of how much money they have to pay for retaining their circles is now out of the picture. While there may be some issues that couple of the companies may have had to pay a little more by and large the negatives are in the price. 

 Now Bharti has a problem separately in Africa because they cannot gain market share easily but at least for something like Idea for example I do not see much of a downside from here. So over a slightly longer term frame when I am saying three to five years from now you should expect to make fairly good money if you were to invest at current level, you would probably beat inflation and interest rates.

Refined soya oil futures gain 0.34% as demand picks up,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/refined-soya-oil-futures-gain-0-34-as-demand-picks-up/articleshow/41775765.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Refined soya oil futures gain 0.34% as demand picks up,"NEW DELHI: Refined soya oil prices traded marginally up by 0.34 per cent to Rs 559.85 per 10 kg in futures trading today as traders created fresh positions, driven by pick up in demand in the spot market. 

 At the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, refined soya oil for delivery in October moved up by Rs 1.90, or 0.34 per cent to Rs 559.85 per 10 kg with an open interest of 1,14,280 lots. 

 Likewise, the oil for delivery in September edged up by Rs 1.80, or 0.30 per cent to Rs 605.60 per 10 kg in 32,660 lots. 

 Analysts said fresh positions built-up by speculators after pick up in demand in spot markets against restricted arrivals from producing regions, mainly led to the rise in refined soya oil prices at futures trade."
Refinery stocks becoming hot-picks due to improving gross refining margins,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/refinery-stocks-becoming-hot-picks-due-to-improving-gross-refining-margins/articleshow/49993467.cms,m.economictimes.com,Refinery stocks becoming hot-picks due to improving gross refining margins,"Refineries stocks, which are often viewed as the ugly ducklings of the hydrocarbon chain, are becoming favourites of investors owing to improving gross refining margins (GRM), lower working capital requirements and shrinking fuel loss on feedstock due to falling crude oil prices. 

 Typically, crude oil accounts for 95% of the total expenditure of the oil refinery. Prices of crude oil fell 21% this year over and above a drop of almost 50% in 2014 thus benefiting refineries. 

 Stocks of refineries including Chennai Petroleum, MRPL, Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have gained in double digits since January 2015 even as the Nifty has lost 5%. 

 Gross refining margins have either improved or remained stable since prices of petroleum products such as petrol diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) have fallen less sharply than crude oil prices. For instance, petrol price has fallen by 37% in the past year against a drop of 45% in crude oil. 
 
 
 
 

 Additionally, cheaper fuel boosts demand. Petrol sales volume grew by 14.8% since January in India, the highest in 12 years and diesel sales grew by 5.38%, a three-year high. 

 Any uptrend in the benchmark GRM is more beneficial to RIL since it earns $2.-2.5 per barrel higher than the benchmark GRM as its refinery can process a wider mix of crude oil varieties. 

 In addition, higher supply of crude is helping refineries in Asia including India to avail of a better bargain from the Arab oil producing nations. Lower prices of crude oil, which is the major feedstock for refineries, means that their working capital need is lower thereby making more funds available for business expansion apart from lower interest payment on short-term financing. 

 Refineries incur fuel loss on the feedstock during processing. When crude oil was hovering at $100 per barrel, fuel loss accounted to $7-9 per barrel, which now has compressed to just $3-4 per barrel.This adds to more profitability of the refineries."
Remain bullish on housing real estate companies : Deven Choksey,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/remain-bullish-on-housing-real-estate-companies-deven-choksey/articleshow/45270711.cms,m.economictimes.com,Remain bullish on housing real estate companies : Deven Choksey,"In a chat with ET Now, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, shares his views on real estates. Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: There is a significant build up when it comes to the entire realty pocket.Is there anything that you consider good for an investment? Are these just trading plays for now? 

 
Deven Choksey: From an investment point of view, the housing real estate companies could be little better play compared to the commercial real estate. The inventories would take at least one and a half to two years to clear. If we see traction, then the market will start discounting the one and a half-two years period. Otherwise this particular space is likely to remain a drag to a great extent. 

 I am not too sure about the trading play. On the housing side, the improvements are definitely seen. There is a demand happening. The credit rate and the interest rate are either coming down or are expected to come down. In such situation,there will be better demand for the housing space. So one could remain strong with the housing space within the real estate business.

"Robust loan growth, margin lift HDFC Bank Q2 net 33%",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/robust-loan-growth-margin-lift-hdfc-bank-q2-net-33/articleshow/6778294.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Robust loan growth, margin lift HDFC Bank Q2 net 33%","MUMBAI: Driven by increase in net interest income, HDFC Bank posted 32.7% rise in net profit for the second quarter of this fiscal year. 
  
  The net profit for the second quarter stood at Rs 912.1 crore while net profit for six months was up 33% at Rs 1,724 crore. Net revenues (net interest income and other income) stood at Rs 3,487 crore, up 15% a year ago. The net interest income (difference between interest earned and interest paid on resources) stood at Rs 2,526 crore, which was driven by 30% asset growth. The net interest margin was 4.2%, same as the corresponding period last year. 
  
  “We expect to grow 4-5 % faster than the system growth (which is projected at 19-20%). Whenever the GDP grows faster, our wholesale loan book has grown faster and whenever the GDP growth slows down, our retail book has grown,” said bank CFO Sashi Jagdishan. “The profit growth is on account of stable margin, robust loan growth and healthy CASA ratio,” he added. The share of low-cost deposits (current and saving account) is half of the total deposits at 50.6% from 47% a year ago. 
  
  Non-interest income fell to Rs 960 crore against Rs 1,007 crore a year ago. The fall is largely on account of treasury loss of Rs 52 crore compared with treasury gains of Rs 165 crore made a year ago. Fees and commission was up 16% to Rs 857 crore against Rs 739 crore. 
  
  Gross advances rose 38% to Rs 158,512 crore. However, after adjusting for one off loans — such as short-term advances — the loan book rose 32%, said Mr Jagdishan. The retail book stood at Rs 81,950 crore and constituted 52% of the total loan book. “During the last quarter, HDFC Bank did not buy any retail home loans from its parent company HDFC. We will buy it in the next quarter,” added Mr Jagdishan. Deposits rose 30.4% to Rs 195,321 crore and half of it was low-cost deposits. The savings account and the current account were Rs 59,525 crore and Rs 39,363 crore, respectively. 
  
  According to Rajiv Mehta, assistant vice-president, India Infoline group, HDFC Bank’s results have exceeded expectations. “The credit deposit ratio touched a multi-quarter high of 80%. The 10 basis point drop in net interest margin was on expected lines as the bank has raised deposit rates twice. Going ahead, we expect margins to stabilise at current levels, aided by the recently announced 25 bps hike in base rate.” He added that the bank was well-placed to tap the expected growth in loans with a capital adequacy ratio of 17%."

Samvat survey: D-Street sees Sensex at 33k by next Diwali,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/samvat-survey-d-street-sees-sensex-at-33k-by-next-diwali/articleshow/49744733.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Samvat survey: D-Street sees Sensex at 33k by next Diwali,"NEW DELHI: Samvat 2072 is likely to be a cracker of a year for equity investors as most market veterans expect benchmark Sensex to head towards a record high of 33,000 in next one year. They expect Nifty50 to top 9,500 by next Diwali, shows a survey conducted by ETMarkets.com. 

 Most analysts see the Sensex move in a 3,000-point range in next one year, while Nifty50 could well top 9,500 in the same period. 

 Samvat 2071 started on a bullish note, but failed to keep up the momentum on Dalal Street, as the benchmark indices plunged over 6 per cent in the last one year, weighed down by both domestic as well as global factors. Both Sensex and Nifty 50 ended the Samvat year over 2 per cent down. 

 “We believe this was a healthy period of consolidation after the rally witnessed last year. We expect earnings growth to pick up going forward and have a 12-month price target of 31,500 for the Sensex and 9,540 for the Nifty50, implying 18 times FY2017E earnings,” said Dinesh Thakkar, CMD, Angel Broking. 

 

 
 

 

 Participants of the ETMarkets.com survey were near unanimous in their assessments that Samvat 2072 looks very promising. After a sharp correction so far in calendar 2015, experts see market valuations at reasonable level and advise investors with a long-term horizon to look at building a strong portfolio by accumulating stocks on every dip. 

 Motilal Oswal, Chairman & Managing Director of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, expects earnings growth to accelerate in the next few quarters leading to a healthy market performance. 

 “The macro-economic stability achieved in last two years has been quite impressive. We are looking at a market return of 20 per cent by next Diwali and expect Sensex to hit 33,000,” he said. 

 
Bull or bear market? 

 The bull vs bear argument has always caught investors’ attention in the past. The S&P BSE Sensex has plunged nearly 15 per cent from the record high of 30,024.74 hit in March. 

 One key highlight of Samvat 2071 has been strong domestic flows into the market, apart from continuing FII flows, which analysts say should keep the momentum going in Samvat 2072. Domestic institutions have invested Rs 50,500 crore in equities so far this year. It is clear that savings are finally moving to financial assets from physical assets, said Kotak Securities. 

 While it will be fair to say that the Indian market is on course to hit a fresh record high, the journey will not be as exciting as it was in Samvat 2070 or calendar 2014. 

 “A lot has happened since last Diwali. Though the index may seem flat, going ahead I still feel that next three to six months will continue to be challenging. The first speed breaker hump is going to be the Fed rate hike,” trader Atul Suri said in an interview with ET Now. 

 “Nobody knows how much of it has been discounted by the market. I personally feel we will have some hiccups before that and earnings growth will a big factor for India,” he said. 

 Suri is of the view that earnings revival has to come to make a case for a larger fundamental bull market to take the indices to lifetime highs. “That is something we have been hoping, hoping, hoping and well we are still hoping.” 

 Most experts expect the market to remain rangebound for the next two quarters given the lack of earnings growth. Earnings are expected to pick up from March 2016, which will lead to a gradual pickup in the broader market, they say. 

 But the bigger trigger would come from pro-growth reforms initiated by the government in the last one-year or so. “Clearly, from this Diwali to next, we would be higher, but it remains to be seen whether you are going to get mega returns or not. For mega returns to come, you need to solve the infrastructure problem which the government is actively working on,” said S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC. 

 “The government has to ensure that the level of real estate under construction and the money stuck there comes down, and the ease of doing business happens. All of this will take more a year, maybe, to play out, but once these three factors are taken care of, you will have a sizeable bull market. If these do not happen, you will get marginal a bull market,” he said. 

 
What will push the market higher in Samvat 2072? 

 Most experts feel the fall in interest rates, earnings revival, capex takeoff and continuation of reforms will push the equity market higher in Samvat 2072. 

 The government has already taken several executive and administrative initiatives to increase the ease of doing business and support growth, which should start showing their impact in the next 12 months or so. 

 Kotak Securities said the government has increased spending by 61 per cent YoY in the first half of FY16. There is a strong focus on infrastructure creation and on bringing in funds for the same. However, any delay in the passage of important legislations like GST would impact market sentiments negatively. 

 ""Going ahead, we expect fiscal reforms to pick up speed in Samvat 2072. Important legislations, especially GST, are expected to be passed, even if in a diluted form,” said the report. “Inflation has come off over the past few months and, we believe it will continue to trend lower. This would open up the window for more rate cuts in FY17,” they say. 

 Major global economies are battling slowdown and there are expectations that lower global growth will push commodities prices southward, which is expected to continue in the short term, but India would still manage to steal the show, experts said. 

 “We believe India presents itself with an opportunity for investors -- both domestic and overseas -- in the medium to long term. We recommend investors to focus on investment in businesses that are likely to receive support from favourable government policies,” said Pradeep Gupta, Co-Founder & Vice-Chairman, AnandRathi Financial Services. 

 “Some of the key initiatives taken up by the government to further improve business environment include the ‘Make in India’ initiative for broader manufacturing with a special emphasis on defence manufacturing. It is estimated that defence spending will increase to almost Rs 3 lakh crore by FY19,” he said."

  Prakash Diwan: On a relative basis, yes, we have been kind of anticipating this stagnation of numbers or I would say at least a growth rate on month-on-month numbers to kind of flatten out a bit and that expectation has been around for quite sometime in the last 3-4 months but importantly what is going to happen is if auto numbers continue to be decent enough even if the growth is not very spectacular, as long as we can manage the input side of the operations well and that’s something that’s causing a lot of concern because most of them have not been able to increase prices.
  
  There is a little bit of a doubt whether the input costs have been completely absorbed or factored in, so all these issues are what’s raising probably a little bit of hackles for the auto investors but otherwise, autos would still continue to see about another quarter, two quarters of decent growth and it is only after that that we will have to revaluate in terms of whether this sector is down and out."

The S&P BSE Sensex hit its all-time high after a flat start, led by gains in realty stocks, Infosys, TCS, HDFC and Dr Reddy's Laboratories.  The previous all-time high for Sensex was 27,354.99.  At 1:10 p.m.; the 30-share index was at 27296.78, up 219.10 points or 0.81 per cent. It touched a high of 27,358.85 and a low of 27,088.65 in early trade ..  Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also managed to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8150, led by gains in realty, IT and consumer durable stocks.  However, the rupee depreciated by 19 paise to 61.54 against the US currency in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange today due to the dollar’s gain against other currencies overseas.  At 01:20 p.m.; BSE Sensex was trading 201 points higher at 27,999. While, Nifty was up 63 points at 8150.40.  Overnight, the US markets ended marginally lower, while the Asian markets were trading mixed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was trading 0.80 per cent higher at 15,676 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was trading 0.63 per cent lower at 23,668.  South Korea’s Kospi index was trading 0.32 per cent lower at 1,954 and China’s Shanghai index was trading 0.62 per cent higher at 2,387.  On expected lines, the US Federal Reserve announced the end of its economic stimulus, known as quantitative easing, on Wednesday. The program was launched during the financial crisis in 2008 to stabilize the economy and support the financial system, which pushed the asset prices higher across the world.  The US Federal Reserve has held rates near zero since December 2008 and has more than quadrupled its balance sheet to $4.4 trillion through three separate asset purchase programs, says a Reuters report.   According to experts, the Federal Reserve did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero “for a considerable time,” but investors were hoping for more dovish commentary from the Fed and that’s why most of the global markets were trading mixed.  “Pulling out of the quantitative easing was kind of expected and that has gone by the plan; but the market was expecting them to give somewhat dovish comment about postponing the possible interest rate hike in the US and that did not happen,” said Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Financial Services.  “That comfort did not come and probably, that risk still continues to remain on the markets. So to that extent, the markets would be disappointed, but I do not think anything would change significantly at this point in time as far as Indian markets are concerned,” he added.  The risk still remains more for emerging markets than for India because of relative stable macro picture as and when US Federal Reserve decides to hike interest rates in near future. Analysts say more sharp swings in stocks are likely as that day draws closer.  “The Fed did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero ‘for a considerable time’. Most economists predict the Fed won’t raise that rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, before June,” AP said in a report.  Not just in India, investors across the globe are worried about the fact that when the US Fed plans to raise interest rates, it could impact foreign institutional inflows. So far in October, FIIs have net sold shares worth Rs 3,200 crore in the Indian markets.  Yes, volatility cannot be ruled out. But the flow of money will go on and India happens to be in a sweet spot compared to the rest of the emerging market economies, they say.  “It is a given that QE is going to end from the US, but at the same time, ECB is looking to start another round of QE. Bank of Japan will come up with another QE, but the dollar is going to be strong and it is the dollar that determines the liquidity in the world,” said Rahul Chadha, Co-CIO of Mirae Asset Global Investments.  “The way we look at it is that countries which do the necessary reforms will get the capital because there is going to be enough capital in the world. Thus, it is not a question of everybody getting free money, which is why we remain more confident about India than other economies like Brazil, Russia, etc,” he added.  India’s long-term story intact:  One thing which experts feel very firmly is the fact that India happens to be in a sweet spot and the whole India story remains intact.  Experts feel that India is more prepared than before to face hike in the US interest rates sometime next year. It will only be a sentimental pull back which should be used as buying opportunity by long-term investors.  India has managed to hold onto its macro factors which is very good thing, when compared with the rest of the emerging market economies and that will aide capital flow.  Growth seems to have bottomed out, crude is falling, inflation is stabalising, economy is showing signs of recovery and corporate earnings are expected to grow considerably in the next couple of quarters, which may attract more foreign capital to India.  Globally, the slowdown in growth rates has dampened the sentiment quite a bit, not just for the Indian markets but across the globe. We have also seen commodities that have corrected significantly in the past couple of months.  “But the action is actually in India and I strongly believe that our future in the next six months in terms of equity markets will be more determined by what New Delhi does than what happens across the globe,” said P Phani Sekhar, Fund Manager-PMS at Angel Broking.  Khemani of Edelweiss if of the view that from medium term to long-term perspective, India remains one of the best markets to be invested into, and equity remains one of the best asset class to be invested into.  Investors are also betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will now announce its stimulus program to revive growth in Euro-zone, and Japan could also do this as early as by the end of this week or beginning next week, say experts. Experts feel that some of this excess liquidity will be coming to India compared to other emerging market economies.  “I expect that both Japan and Europe will continue with monetary easing and quantitative easing for a couple of quarters more and early indication seems to suggest to me that Japan could do this as early as by the end of this week,” said Sashi Krishnan, Chief Investment Officer, Birla Sun Life Insurance.  “Yes, there will be some sort of QE-induced slowdown or outflows of overseas investors coming into India,” he added."

 Commercial vehicle financing is going through a lean patch due to economic slowdown impacting players in this space. 

 The company, which deals in the commercial vehicle and equipment financing, said that while its on-balance sheet assets under management (AUM) grew by 40 per cent to Rs 35,910 crore, offbook assets rose by 1.87 per cent to Rs 16,586 crore during the first quarter. 

 Referring to cost of credit, Revankar said that it would depend on the liquidity situation. 

 ""Cost of credit will depend on the liquidity situation. After the RBI measures to squeeze liquidity from the system, short-term rates had gone up. However, we feel that it is a short-term measure and liquidity situation will improve in the future,"" Revankar said. 

 Revankar said the company is increasing its presence in rural areas which will give it higher yield, and it is also trying to diversify funding sources by tapping into the retail space. 

 Shriram Transport Finance, which has recently come up with a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue, is also witnessing sound response to its offer, Revankar said. 

 On the asset quality front, while gross NPA of the company rose to 3.09 per cent from 3 per cent reported a year ago, net NPA increased marginally to 0.68 per cent from 0.62 per cent reported a year ago. 

 ""We have done well in the asset quality front given the current environment. We hope to hold on to the asset quality,"" Revankar said."

Smallcap capital goods stocks finding favour with investors: Harendra Kumar,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/smallcap-capital-goods-stocks-finding-favour-with-investors-harendra-kumar/articleshow/49375852.cms,m.economictimes.com,Smallcap capital goods stocks finding favour with investors: Harendra Kumar,"In a chat with ET Now, Harendra Kumar, MD, Institutional Equities, Elara Capital, shares his view on cyclical stocks.
 
 
ET Now: We keep on talking about how the economic recovery is still some time away. The first one-and-a-half years of the Modi government have not really produced those winners. But somehow the buying interest seems to be in economy-related sectors. Some of the capital goods companies saw some buying last week. We have seen some buying in freight corridor companies such as Gateway Distriparks. Infrastructure names too are attracting attention. HDFC Mutual Fund has bought stake in MEP Infra. What are your thoughts on the wide basket of stocks?
 
 
Harendra Kumar: Some of the names that you mentioned are clearly the companies that have not been investors' favourites in the previous rally. These are smaller names, aligned to the newer opportunities the Modi government is leading them to.
 
 So, the stock picking is happening with the three-year perspective with focus on companies which have clear balance sheets and where investors can bet on their promoters. We are seeing this kind of shift with a lot of investor interest. A corollary to this is obviously the opportunity of smaller companies, which are aligned to state budgets. You would have seen the order book of J Kumar Infra and KNR Infrastructure moving up. Similarly you have PNC Infratech as well. So, the traditional infrastructure names of the previous rally are no longer the favourites. But investors are looking at newer smaller infrastructure or capital goods companies to play on the cyclical recovery.
 
 One caveat I would like to have here is that older capital goods companies which are on the industrial side are extremely expensive, trading typically in the range of 40 PE on forward earnings, even as their ROEs are extremely low. In this context, newer and smaller names are finding more optimism and are seeing buying by fund managers."

Despite mixed global cues and rising crude prices, Nifty and Sensex ended higher, with Nifty ending above the 17,700. Broader markets outperformed the headline indices.
 
Here's how analysts read the market pulse:

Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities, said: “Zooming into the 15 minute chart, we see that though Nifty witnessed selling pressure from the highs, the index recovered from the lows and managed to close with healthy gains. The short term trend therefore remains up as the Nifty moved above the previous swing high of 17,429 and made higher bottoms over the last few weeks.
 
Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said: ""Nifty remained volatile during the day before closing on a flat note. On the daily chart, the index has been consolidating for the last few days. However, it has sustained above the crucial moving average on the daily timeframe confirming the uptrend. On the higher end, the index may move towards 17,950. On the lower end, support is visible at 17,650/17,550.""

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s action:


Stocks gain ground on Wall Street
Stocks mostly rose in morning trading on Wall Street, but major indexes remained unsettled as more big companies report earnings.

The S&P 500 fell 0.3% as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.5%. Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms plummeted 22.1% after reporting a second straight quarter of revenue decline amid falling advertising sales and stiff competition from TikTok. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 452 points, or 1.4%, to 32,299.
 

European markets close higherThe pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day a marginal 0.08% higher, having earlier touched its highest level since September 20 in a see-saw session as traders digested the latest 75 basis point rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB). European stocks fell after the ECB policy announcement but quickly regained ground and ended the day higher having traded as much as 0.9% lower in the build-up during morning trading.


Tech View: Inside barOn the daily chart, the Nifty formed an Inside Bar. The hourly chart shows that the index is forming a distribution below the key Fibonacci retracement at 17,800 for the last couple of sessions, analysts said. After consolidating around the 17,800 zone for the last three sessions, any upside could lead the index towards the 18000-18200 zone.


Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trend in the counters of SJVN, JSW Steel, DCB Bank, Ircon and DCW, among others.

The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.


Stocks signalling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of PCBL, Allcargo Logistics, Vardhaman, Easy Trip and EID Parry, among others.

A bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they had just begun their downward journey.


Most active stocks in value termsICICI Bank (Rs 1489 crore), RIL (Rs 1414 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 1161 crore), Bajaj Finance (Rs 1150 crore), and Axis Bank (Rs 1091 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with highest trading turnovers in the day.


Most active stocks in volume termsYES Bank (Shares traded: 11.13 crore), PNB (Shares traded: 9.63 crore), Suzlon Energy (Shares traded: 8.41 crore), RBL Bank (Shares traded: 7.64 crore) and Tata Steel (Shares traded: 7.43 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.


Stocks showing buying interestShares of SJVN, IIFL Finance, Phoenix Mills, Tamilnad Mercantile, Granules India and Concor, among others, witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment.


Stocks seeing selling pressureShares of NMDC, Gland Pharma, Nykaa, Prince Pipes, Delhivery and Mphasis, among others, witnessed strong selling pressure and hit their 52-week lows, signaling bearish sentiment on the counters.


Sentiment meter favours bullsMarket breadth favoured losers as 1,787 stocks ended in the green, while 1,641 names ended with cuts.

Stable market to arrest slide of banking stocks: Deven Choksey,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/stable-market-to-arrest-slide-of-banking-stocks-deven-choksey/articleshow/21507090.cms,m.economictimes.com,Stable market to arrest slide of banking stocks: Deven Choksey,"In a chat with ET Now, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, shared her views on the banking sector.
 
 
ET Now: What has spooked the banks? If Tuesday’s policy was more like a no-event, what is really disturbing markets here? Why is the Bank Nifty under intense pressure?
 
 
Deven Choksey: RBI maintained that instead of withdrawing the tight monetary policy and bringing down the rates, they would probably do it in a gradual manner, which could possibly kill this quarter. Wherever they have a bulk deposit related issue, the impact on the margins will come up to a greater extent.
 
 On the back of envelope cases calculation, every 1% increase in the borrowing cost results into around 30 bps negative impact on to the NIMs. Assuming that, there is 2% increase in the borrowing cost, which could go down to by about 60 bps. If this is translated into a quarterly basis, then it would be about a 15 bps impact coming on to the books of these banks. We do not know whether this is an actual impact coming on to the books of these banks because of the bulk deposit. Yet, the market had to readjust and that is where the analysts have downgraded most of the banks because of the bulk deposit related issues.
 
 As market gets some amount of stability based on such calculation, the down fall into the stock prices would probably get arrested. We would probably see some amount of stability before increasing the prices."
Steady track record to drive profit numbers for Shriram Transport,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/steady-track-record-to-drive-profit-numbers-for-shriram-transport/articleshow/5483714.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steady track record to drive profit numbers for Shriram Transport,"The quarter ending December 2009 turned out to be the best quarter for Shriram Transport Finance in the current fiscal. The company, which is a market leader in the used commercial vehicle financing, had posted a 20 per cent year-on-year profit growth in the first half of FY10. 
  
  Backed by high growth in disbursements, improvement in net interest margin (NIM) and moderation in operating expenses , the company ended December 2009 quarter with a 59 per cent profit growth.
  
  Shriram Transport’s disbursements were up 70 per cent in the December 2009 quarter, thanks to a recovery in the new commercial vehicle (CV) market. The sales of new CVs are on upward trend and even the freight rates have moved up. Consequently , the demand for financing of new CVs too has gone up. 
  
  However, the growth number is a bit skewed because in the corresponding period last year, the new CV sales had dipped due to the slowdown . Meanwhile, the company posted an impressive 50 per cent growth in disbursements in its niche segment of used CV financing.
  
  The company reported a NIM of 7.33 per cent in December 2009 quarter compared to 6.95 per cent in December 2008 quarter and 7.07 per cent in the September 2009 quarter. The liquidity conditions, which had worsened in the corresponding period last year, have recovered totally, helping in expansion of NIM. 
  
  A part of improvement in NIMs was due to change in the business-mix also. Typically, used CV loan constitute 75 per cent of total disbursements, but in the December 2009 quarter, it constituted 80 per cent of total disbursements. Since old CV loans are high yielding than loans on new CVs, NIMs got an upward thrust. So, a bit of improvement in NIMs was due to one-time factor. 
  
  However, NIM has returned to the normal range and liquidity conditions continue to be healthy. Therefore, it’s unlikely that there will be any pressure on NIMs in the coming months. Meanwhile, the company’s operating expenses including salaries, provisions and write-offs grew by 14 per cent in December 2009 quarter compared to 18 per cent growth in the six months ending September 2009.
  
  On the business side, the recovery in the CV market has started. Since it is a cyclical industry, the current recovery phase is expected to continue for a couple of years. That coupled with the company’s steady record in used CV financing will help it in maintaining a high profit growth, going forward."

 Nitin Raheja: TVS has been one of the stocks that we hold in our portfolios for clients. There is a robustness of the numbers with regard to the scooter space for TVS. There is humongous demand. The three-wheelers that they sell are almost at two times or three times of what they sell in the export markets. That is taking off for them. TVS has had a very high spend because of because of low market share.
 
 If you look at the sales, distribution and advertisement cost it, has been far higher per buy vis-à-vis its competitors. When you see advantage of scale taking place on a large turnover base, even if you have a swing of 1- 2 per cent, there will be big numbers going to the operating.

Devang Mehta: Suven Life Sciences is an excellent high-growth, high-margin business which operates out of the new chemical entity-based, contract research-manufacturing space. 

 Typically, it is a pharma stock which enjoys very high margins. In addition, it has a huge monetisation opportunity for one of its molecule — SUVN-502. The molecule is in the advance stage. 

 Other than this, the company has no working capital issues; it has superb balance sheet and good return ratios. We feel that this stock can probably be a dark horse going forward. We have a very conservative price target of around Rs 336 for Suven Life Sciences."
Texmaco Rail on fast track as wagon demand picks up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/texmaco-rail-on-fast-track-as-wagon-demand-picks-up/articleshow/43476260.cms,m.economictimes.com,Texmaco Rail on fast track as wagon demand picks up,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Warren Buffet is bullish on railways, having bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $34 billion four years ago.
 
 The same logic that the railroad makes good economic sense in a country as vast as the US also applies to India and its largest wagon manufacturer Texmaco Rail, which provides the best investment in the rail industry. 

 Texmaco had a bad FY14 though. Under the previous government, very few orders were placed and in the previous fiscal there were none, resulting in FY14 revenue plunging 46%. But with a new government at the Centre, things are changing. 

 The government has highlighted increasing wagon demand by 25% to 25,000 from the current year onwards.
 
 In June, Indian Railways resumed wagon orders — 3,000 from Texmaco to be delivered in the current year.
 
 
 The Texmaco management believes that this is just the beginning and is already seeing big demand, not only from the government but also from the private sector. 

 With a capacity of 10,000 wagons, it has a 25% market share and is the only company in India with an in-house engineering department. “We are likely to get an order for 1,000 wagons from defence services in the next one month for moving tankers and artillery,” chief financial officer AK Vijay told ET. 

 Vijay was also upbeat on passenger coaches. “The present capacity of the railways cannot meet the demand for passenger coaches. We have supplied the prototype to Indian Railways.
 
 Once approved, we will be eligible for future orders.” Demand from the private sector, which dropped to 1,000 wagons in 2013 from 5,000 earlier, is expected to rise. 

 “We have already started supplying specialised wagons to Hyundai and Ford and intend to supply to others as well. Going ahead, demand from the private sector will gradually improve and you will also see that white goods will also be transported by rail,” Vijay said. 

 In addition to this, the recent acquisition of Kalindee Rail makes the combined entity a complete rail solutions provider.
 
 While Texmaco is present in wagon manufacturing, Kalindee is engaged in infrastructure and signaling.
 
 The company is also planning to enter the railway infrastructure segment, with plans to build steel castings for railway lines. 

 “The Indian railway system is in dire need of renovation and expansion. In addition to this, we are confident of securing international orders as well. Our quality of products is acceptable to the US, Australian and Scandinavian railroads,” said Vijay.
 
 Given its capacity and orders, the future looks impressive."
Textile companies' good run likely to last for another year,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/textile-companies-good-run-likely-to-last-for-another-year/articleshow/30330034.cms,m.economictimes.com,Textile companies' good run likely to last for another year,"It has been a stellar six months for India’s textiles companies. 

 A weak rupee, consistent demand from China and a buoyancy in demand in the US and European markets, have helped as textiles companies across the value chain have done well. But it is companies who are into production of raw materials, especially yarn besides production and export of garments which have recorded a higher growth in revenues. 

 
Rally could well run for a year 

 So will the rally in textile stocks on the back of the buoyancy in the sector, be sustained? It well could for perhaps a year, especially for companies who manufacture garments and yarn. 

 Here’s why: Yarn-and-garment-manufacturing companies reported a revenue growth ranging between 15 per cent and 53 per cent in the last six months on a year-on-year basis. Taking a cue from this, investors appear to be buying into this story. The ET Textile Index, which mirrors many textiles companies, reported returns of 47 per cent in the last six months compared with 8 per cent returns by the S&P Sensex. 

 

 There is the competitiveness of India’s textiles industry. Labour costs in Bangladesh and China are relatively high and Bangladesh , which had emerged as an alternate market to India, is also weighed down by a political strife. This could work in favour of India’s yarn, fabrics and garment manufacturing companies. 

 
Chinese demand factor and the Indian advantage 

 Besides this, the fortunes of Indian textiles companies are linked to the demand from China . Of the yarn which it produces, 30 per cent is exported to China. Demand from China for cotton yarn is expected to continue for at least one year. Thanks to various quota systems in China , companies there find import of cotton more attractive than producing or buying in their local markets. 

 In fact, to support its farmers, the Chinese government has been buying and stocking cotton at 20,400 Yuan per tonne when international cotton prices are trading at close to 15,000 Yuan per tonne. This makes Chinese cotton expensive there, forcing Chinese companies to import yarn. 

 This works well for Indian companies such as Vardhman Textiles, TT, Nahar Spinning Mills and Nitin Spinners. On the valuation front, Vardhman Textiles is placed better than most spinners. The company is trading at one year forward price to earnings multiple of 3.49 times, which is lower than its five-year average price to earnings multiple. 

 
The Benefit of a Weak Rupee 

 The weakening of the rupee has also boosted garment-manufacturing companies. Interestingly , the recovery in the US and European markets will continue to help garment-manufacturing companies such as Gokaldas Exports , Mandhana Industries, Raymond and Arvind in providing a leg-up to their business. 

 These companies are also expected do well because of the 2 per cent interest incentive offered by the Indian government on incremental exports and on an annual basis. From a valuation perspective, Arvind and Mandhana Industries are poised for better, trading at one year forward price to earnings ratio of 9.9 and 14.7 times, which are lower than their five-year price to earnings multiples."

Ashwani Gujral: This is a follow-through of yesterday's events. Once the previous low of 5980 is taken out, the market should accelerate. The real reason for the market fall is that we were overbought and we needed a reason to correct, as did all other markets. So, chances are that the head and shoulder pattern which has broken down decisively below about 6050-6080, the target of that should be closer to 5700-5800.

Tube Investments climbs 11% on stake sale in insurance JV,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tube-investments-climbs-11-on-stake-sale-in-insurance-jv/articleshow/50349168.cms,m.economictimes.com,Tube Investments climbs 11% on stake sale in insurance JV,"NEW DELHI: Shares of Tube Investments of India climbed over 11 per cent to hit fresh 52-week high in Monday's session after the company's board approved selling of its 14 per cent stake in the joint venture (JV), Cholamandalam MS General Insurance, for a consideration of Rs 882.67 crore. 

 The stock climbed 11.23 per cent to hit a high of Rs 445.05 on BSE, breaching its previous high of Rs 439.90 hit on October 20. 

 The company would sell its stake to the existing JV partner Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. The stake sale pegged the value of the joint venture company at Rs 6,305 crore. 

 L RamKumar, MD, Tube Investments, said in an interview to ET Now that his company will use the proceeds to retire debt. It would take another 2-3 months for the company to get the required approvals, the spokesperson said. The long-term debt of the company stood at Rs 1,000 crore. 

 Earlier, MM Murugappan, Chairman of Tube Investments, in a regulatory filing to BSE said, ""I am delighted that Mitsui Sumitomo is increasing its stake in Chola MS to 40 per cent. This will further strengthen our relationship with Mitui Sumitomo and help realise our vision in making Chola MS the most respected general insurer in India."" 

 Foreign partners can bring in foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 49 per cent in the insurance sector. In November, Japanese Nippon Life agreed to buy an additional 23 per cent stake in Reliance Life Insurance for Rs 2,265 crore. 

 AXA in May announced its intentions to increase its stake in Bharti AXA Life Insurance. UK's Bupa too has raised its stake in Max Bupa JV."
Tube Investments set for upgrade after insurance JV stake sale,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tube-investments-set-for-upgrade-after-insurance-jv-stake-sale/articleshow/50360165.cms,m.economictimes.com,Tube Investments set for upgrade after insurance JV stake sale,"Tube Investments, manufacturer of iconic Hercules bicycles and supplier to auto makers, received a shot in the arm after it sold 14% stake in Cholamandalam MS General Insurance. 

 This may trigger valuation re-rating of the residual stake in the insurance venture as well as bring down its debt burden. The combined positive impact of these two factors lifted its stock 11.62% on Monday, the highest one-day percentage change since September 2014, to end at Rs 446.6. There are two factors that might help analysts to lift their target price on the stock. 

 One, the company will receive nearly Rs 882 crore post selling 14% stake in the insurance company. This will be used to retire the debt of the company and consequently, bring down the interest expense by nearly half. 

 At the end of FY15, the company has a total debt of Rs 1,420 crore, and is expected to receive net proceeds of Rs 750-800 crore from stake sale after deduction in capital gains. 

 De Arul Kaarthick, analyst with Karvy stock broking says that the interest cost of Tube Investments will come down to Rs 79 crore for the next fiscal versus Rs 122 crore this year. The company’s profit margin for the next year may improve by 120-150 basis points. 

 Secondly, after selling 14% stake, Tube Investments will still own 60% in the insurance firm. Given that the current deal is valued at 8.46x the book value, much lower than currently factored by the analyst, the revised valuation for general insurance could set higher valuation benchmark of the remaining stake and could potentially trigger valuation rerating of the insurance company."

  Sugar companies and their investors have cheered the return of the Samajwadi Party to power in UP as they hope that Mulayam Singh’s dream of making the state India’s largest sugar producer will result in the new government offering fresh sops or reviving its old pro-industry investment policy.
   
  Shares of sugar companies, with large operations in UP, rose early on Tuesday as it became clear that the Samajwadi Party was heading to form a government in Lucknow, but profit-booking during the later part of the day in an overall volatile market saw sugar stocks end in the red.
   
  At 11:00 a.m., leading producer Bajaj Hindusthan was trading 2.4% higher at Rs 34.20, while Dhampur Sugar Mills rose 2.3% to Rs 40.90 and Dwarikesh Sugar was marginally higher at Rs 42.00 on the BSE.
   
  In the broader market, the BSE barometer Sensex was trading marginally lower at 17,169, while the 50-share Nifty index was up 0.05% 5224.
   
  According to an ET report, UP chief minister Mulayam Singh had announced a scheme in 2004 that gave generous incentives like capital subsidy, entry tax exemption, and reimbursement of transport cost, stamp duty, registration charges and purchase tax for 5-10 years to sugar companies investing above Rs 350 crore.
   
  Attracted by the scheme, between 2005 and 2007, companies such as Bajaj Hindusthan, Balrampur Chini, Uttam Group, Dwarikesh, Triveni, Parle, DSCL, Dhampur, Triveni, Rana Sugar, Simbhaoli Sugar, and Dalmiya invested more than Rs 5,000 crore in 28 new plants and expansion projects.
   
  
  Technical View: Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral. com
   
  For a genuine long-term contrarian investor who does not bother looking at things, this is one of the greatest bottoming out opportunity in sugar stocks. If you are a trader, they are just moving within a range of Rs 5-10 which nakes it extremely difficult to trade within such a narrow range.
   
  But let me just say that sugar is bottoming out for the long term and anybody who can seriously hold these stocks will benefit."

 Bajaj Hindustan surged as much as 7.8 per cent in morning trade, followed by Oudh Sugar which rose over 11 per cent. Mawana Sugar and Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd managed to gain 3.4 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively in opening trade today.
 
 The industry has also threatened that no further investments would be made in the sugar sector. In fact, sugar mills have posted notices on their units telling the farmers that they should look for alternatives to sell their cane crop as mills won't be able to buy this sugar season, ET reported.
 
 At 09:40 a.m.; Bajaj Hindustan was trading 6.8 per cent higher at 13.97, followed by Oudh Sugar Mills Ltd which was up 8.8 per cent to Rs 17.30. Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd was up 3.9 per cent and Mawana Sugar was trading 4.6 per cent higher.
 
 The fate of Uttar Pradesh's Rs 35,000-crore sugar industry, which is the sole and largest agriculture-based industry, hinges on one decision - the price of sugarcane, ET reported.
 
 Though the chief minister is likely to send the state-advised price of cane to the Cabinet on November 25, things have already turned sour for the sugar industry and cane farmers.
 
 According to the ET report, typically, governments in UP have favoured farmers when it comes to deciding the cane price, with the intention of garnering their votes.
 
 Also, given the steep increases that previous chief minister Mayawati had implemented in cane price (SAP), Akhilesh Yadav would feel constrained to do so. State authorities indicated that cane price this season also would depend largely on the escalation in the input cost for farmers over the years."

  We understand that they have got a very diversified revenue stream as far as main company is concerned and they are quoting at a significant discount to all the majors like Infosys or Wipro. So to that extent, I do believe that this fall should be taken as an opportunity to buy into the counter.

 ""We are very proud to be an independent asset manager. We are the only large asset manager which is not controlled by a corporate or a bank. This gives us a unique position in terms of being an independent financial institution,"" Puri said. 

 The country's oldest fund house, which manages assets worth over USD 15 billion, is planning to launch an Initial Public Offer (IPO) and would be the country's first asset management company to go public. 

 ""One of the benefits I see from our IPO is that it will strengthen our character as an independent asset manager,"" Puri told PTI in an interview here. 

 Listing out the benefits in this regard, Puri said a large number of retail investors after the IPO, along with a professional management and a board-governed structure, would make it further answerable to the market for its performance. 

 ""We certainly should be answerable and transparent and people should be able to ask us how we are doing and what we are doing. We would like to be positioned that way. It will keep us on our toes,"" he added. 

 Puri said that UTI Mutual Fund is an asset manager today in entirety. UTI Mutual Fund was carved out of the erstwhile Unit Trust of India as a mutual fund in February 2003. 

 It is promoted by the four of the largest public sector financial institutions as sponsors -- SBI, LIC, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank. These four each hold 18.5 per cent stake in UTI Asset Management Company, while US-based fund house T Rowe Price has acquired a 26 per cent stake. 

 ""We are no longer a conglomerate. We are not the old UTI which was promoting exchanges and other entities,"" he said, while adding that the institution is very proud of the role it played in the past but that phase is over now. 

 ""That phase of India's history is done and today it is much more important to focus and excel in what you do. We are asset manager in broad sense and that is what we want to excel at,"" he said. 

 Talking about the benefits that an independent character bring in, Puri said it gives you greater credibility and ensures that there are no conflicts of interest, in comparison to others promoted by business houses or even banks. 

 ""There is nothing to conflict us in terms of how we run our operations or how we influence the governance of the companies. The two roles of an asset manager are to allocate capital and to influence governance. 

 ""The best asset managers across the world are the independent ones, because these two functions ideally and even from a systemic point of view are best carried out by a company that has got a broad-based ownership and board governance, as opposed to being subsidiarised. 

 ""I think our markets will mature in that direction also, but UTI is already there as a role model of what you could build,"" he added."

ET Now: Do you think the selling in IT is still not complete?
 
 
Arindam Ghosh: In couple of quarters going forward, we can definitely see some of the IT companies both frontline and the mid-tier to come under some pressure.
 
 But overall, we must remember that the recovery in the US and European markets is going to be quite strong this year. This will definitely counterbalance or offset to a certain extent any kind of adverse movement in currency.
 
 One should therefore continue to have or utilise these opportunities to buy into these IT companies as and how the earnings or results keep coming out over the next two quarters.
 
 One must also keep a fair balance between export-led and domestic-led. So, this cannot be a situation where you get into a complete swing trade and build your portfolio on the basis of domestic cyclicals and completely ignore the export-led companies.
 
 It is a careful and calibrated rebalancing which needs to be done keeping in mind a whole lot of factors like the election outcome.
 
 Of course, we have to see beyond the elections on how the fundamentals and various dynamics like growth, inflation and interest rates play out.

The company’s net sales dropped 18% - with cigarette sales impacted by aggressive price increases taken by the company to pass on the additional tax burden. At 27.5%, the operating profit margin dropped almost 200 bps y-o-y. The net profit dropped over 5% from the year ago level. 

 According to a report by Anand Rathi after the results, the company’s cigarette volumes in the March quarter fell 15% y-o-y and for FY13 they were down 12%. The company has rolled out 64mm cigarettes at Rs 2 and Rs 2.50. There has been no change in excise duty on cigarettes of less than 65mm. 

 With aggressive price hikes in all premium cigarettes, 64mm cigarettes are expected to gain market share. According to the report, VST’s brands Charms and Charminar, which are at low end of the cigarette market, may gain market share in 64mm cigarettes on any down-trading from premium cigarettes. 

 According to a post-results report by ICICI Securities, the 64 mm category of cigarettes contributed ~8% to the company’s volumes. The volume share of this category is expected to increase considering the second consecutive year of excise hikes in Budget 2013. 

 The company has a strategy to pass on any excise hikes and concentrate on low price cigarettes with those categories, which do not attract high duty. VST fetches similar margins in 64 mm and 69 mm categories. The company has increased its payout to 76%, which yields a dividend of 4% at current price.

 On the outlook of the company, Dasgupta said: ""We are mostly selling washing machines and refrigerators. Now we would focus on air-conditioners and microwaves also. We are selling it, but at a very small scale at some places. Now we are planning it to grow on national level."" 

 The company's sales in festive period grew 20 per cent. Shares of the company closed up by 4.29 per cent at Rs 493.95 on BSE."

4930 would be the level to watch out for: BNP Paribas,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/4930-would-be-the-level-to-watch-out-for-bnp-paribas/articleshow/5488860.cms,m.economictimes.com,4930 would be the level to watch out for: BNP Paribas,"Gaurang Shah, asst vice president, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services in an interview with ET Now says that 4930 would be the level to watch out for next week.What’s your sense? I mean after today’s sell off in the initial part, it almost seems like post Reliance’s numbers, sentiment turned around. Have those numbers had a negative surprise, market was sure to go down further from these levels?The irony about the whole market situation is that at 5200+, we are like superstars and at sub-5000, we are like untouchables. So from that point of view, one needs to keep shoulder on head and if one does not want to think about tomorrow or may be about one week or a fortnight, then it is definitely time to cherry pick valuations. Of course 4 or 5% down, much does not really mean in terms of downtick in terms of valuation but it does call for 25-30% selective stock picks because there has been stock specific moves in the market. So rather than trading Nifty or Sensex like I said earlier, it makes sense to cherry pick on some of these stocks and sectors. How are you placing Bharti at this point?We have been a contrarian call as far as the entire telecom is concerned. Most of the experts have been cautious on the telecom pack but we feel instead of saying it from a one or two quarter basis, give it a little bit more stretched out time horizon, 'yes’ because of tariff wars, the ARPUs will come under pressure. Revenues profitability will be affected but if you think beyond six months, eight months to a year time, 3G penetration and of course the rural expansion will add on to the bottom-line of most of the cellular frontline companies. So on that point of view, the top choice remains Bharti. Post that, RComm and then possibly Idea. Again your subscriber base is going to improve month on month, there is no doubt about it but in the near term at least two quarters, you will see a kind of a contraction in the profitability of the company. So we are not talking about three to six months but definitely one year plus, we would look at lower levels to buy into telecom.Realty also as a space down about 2% and no surprises there really. That entire pocket, how would you approach it now?Very selective and it is still reflecting what we saw about two months back, market performs good, you have real estate being a superhero and if the markets are bad, definitely it is going to be one of the underdogs. I would possibly look at the new boy on the block that’s Godrej Properties. So that company, the real estate pack, looks a little bit more attractive. HDIL, DLF, Unitech. Mahindra Lifespaces incidentally is another one that one should keep on the radar because that possibly will have an uptake and the recent ruling, the FSI from 2.2 to 2.5 to about 3 is going to have a lot of buildings coming under redevelopment. That will be a big positive.In terms of the metal stocks, especially there was a lot of profit booking that came into the market, especially on JSW Steel and Hindalco? How are you placing these stocks at this point in time?The entire metal gamut I would rather look out for steel and copper. These will be the two first preferences and then possibly zinc to a certain extent. Aluminium, however, I would avoid for a certain time because of the volatility in the aluminium prices. The margins keep on fluctuating to a great extent but ‘yes’ steel. If you just want to elaborate a little bit further, the infrastructure focus that’s going to go will definitely have offtake of cement and steel both because these are the two core raw materials that go into making a good infrastructure. So from that point of view, forget about exports. Domestically itself, the consumption could possibly go up by 10-12% and that will provide opportunities for steel manufacturers and we are quite optimistic about it.How are you taking a look at Hindustan Copper?Too much of hype actually over there and one will definitely want to wait to create any kind of new positions. Now if you would have possibly got invested at lower levels, then definitely stay put but this entire gamut of PSU stocks running up in terms of valuation and at what valuation is the issue going to come is going to be a big question mark. If it is nowhere near what the market expects, then you will see a heavy sell off. So at these kinds of run-ups of roundabout 10-15-20%, I would definitely avoid, wait for it to cool off a little bit and then possibly get into it.L&T numbers disappointed the street. ICICI Bank did not match expectations. Reliance surprised on the positive. What do you make of these numbers?If you put the whole thing in perspective, it would be a little bit inappropriate to judge Q3 numbers and the overall performance for the entire year. Yes, Q3 has been bad and rightly so. All the managements that came and spoke on the various media including ICICI Bank, L&T, ONGC were quite vocal enough that Q3 has had its own problems.Going forward and slipping into Q4, problems are not going go last for all that long and definitely there is going to be brighter days to see going forward from hereon. So from that point of view, opportunity does exist in counters like L&T, ICICI Bank, ONGC and BHEL including Reliance Industries to find value at lower levels and we feel that one-odd quarter in the four quarters, Q3 being negative does not spell negativity for the entire year.By the time we end the financial year, Q4 will definitely bring out some cheerful times and numbers to speak about and that will speak for itself from a longer term perspective. So I am quite optimistic that capital goods engineering going forward will definitely deliver.What’s your sense?I would look at mid-cap players and one of the mid-caps that has been a hit was the Chettinad Cement stock that we spoke a while back. Other than that, we are looking at Shree Cement. We are looking at Keshoram and we are looking at Birla. These are some of the mid-cap cement ideas that we are a little bit positive about. Yes, there was a lot of talk about excess capacity coming in and of course the demand-supply really not going in favour of demand and oversupply coming in and that would possibly have a negative impact. But infrastructure is going to drive both steel and cement going forward. So I am a little bit more optimistic.Chettinad, you recommended the stock when it was much lower than the current valuations, you are right now. At 592, would you still go ahead and buy it?I would not want to bite the dust over there honestly speaking because that’s the kind of target that we were speaking about from a little bit stretched out time horizon. At 590+, it would be like catching the hot iron. What’s the overall call on the oil and gas space?Well ‘yes’, it has been under pressure but we like again the mid-cap players over there, may be something like a Cairn India or a Selan, Shiv-Vani Oil. Definitely there are opportunities over there. Hindustan Oil Exploration is also there. On the other hand, I would use opportunities to exit at higher levels and on the flipside, ONGC the big weight, definitely sub-1100 will be a good level to possibly look at ONGC from a long-term perspective. Like I have mentioned earlier, Q4 and next fiscal will be definitely better for most of the companies, which have been a little bit negative in Q3 this fiscal. What do you think, 1150 in terms of PAT, almost trebling of profits?Yeah and when we were speaking about metal, zinc was one other commodity that I mentioned and ‘yes’, definitely going forward from hereon, we will see better margins over there. So we are quite optimistic about it. Of course, there are hardly any players in this particular field but an odd one out, Hindustan Zinc, may be after the initial euphoria cools off, definitely one can look at Hindustan Zinc.1180, would you buy it or would you wait for a lower level?We saw the stock hovering around 500 or 600 if I am not mistaken in bad times, then climbed up to 1300 if I am not mistaken and you have seen a little bit of a cool off over there. Sub-1100 will be comfortable to look at it.Would that be an avoid for you as well, Dish TV?Yes and I do not think life beyond 54-55 looks quite possible for Dish TV. The entire gamut, the DTH, there are a lot of policies that needs a clarification to come through. You have huge competition from the unorganised cable operators. So from that point of view, I would definitely give it a pass, better sectors, better shares to look at if you really want to get invested from a long-term timeframe.Fortis - the kind of growth that we have seen in the quarter, does that take you by surprise?It does take me by surprise but if you ask me whether I take a buy call on the entire healthcare, I would definitely avoid. I really do not think that kind of uptick is going to be there on a sustainable basis. So I would rather give a run. Of course, there is going to be a huge consolidation that one speaks about in the entire healthcare space. So I would definitely avoid it as of time being and may be look at it as the news unfolds and possibly in the next couple of quarters if there is going to be a buyable kind of a situation.What about Allahabad Bank and Corporation Bank especially?Corporation Bank I believe we have a buy as a disclosure. Our clients might be holding the position but Allahabad Bank, I would wait for a little bit of correction. Yes, there has been this great liking towards the small and regional PSU banks on the fallback of this great event that will unfold over a period of time but I would look at UCO Bank, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank more aggressively rather than Allahabad Bank. Corporation Bank, yes, definitely a buy.Coming to the auto component pack, especially some of those tyre companies, Ceat and Apollo Tyres. Which from these do you like?Actually I will go with MRF because with the kind of market share. Of course it is a little bit highly priced share but definitely looks more attractive. In terms of commodity prices, rubber, they are better placed compared to its peers and of course the fact that it has got its product in the entire range of tyres that they have. So from that point of view, I would rather go in for MRF and in the other auto ancillary pack, Clutch Auto and Sona Koyo are the other two that I would possibly look at. Of course, they are a very limited choice as of now because the entire story depends upon how the entire auto sector is going to unfold over a period of time. The positive impact of auto sector unfolding and the effect coming on to auto ancillary is going to take a while.What about Asian Paints? There is a lot of institutional interest given with the float or the shares traded in the market are not as much for the public. Do you like the paints business? Yeah and with the kind of number of revival of real estate, that will spell opportunity for these kinds of frontline paint manufacturing companies. Of course like you rightly mentioned, there is not much of liquidity, so not one of the favourites amongst the players. Another thing is that Asian Paints does his own act. It really does not react with what market has to do. From that point of view, somebody who has a lot of time has patience definitely looks attractive. But these kinds of levels, if you ask me, I would not mind deploying a portion of my investible amount - may be about 15-20% definitely calls for it. Relative strength in IT and do you want to play along with that?Yes, I would definitely and we have a buy report on Mahindra Satyam. We have a buy report on HCL Tech. Tech Mahindra was the third one that we have a buy report.  What are the targets in Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam?To put a figure will be difficult but from a percentage point of view, if you have 4-6 months time horizon, definitely you will have at least 5-10% upside in all the three stocks that I just mentioned.Do you think balancing of the portfolio would require something like an HDFC also, given that the stock is not cheap but consistency of performance in growth continues for that one?Yes, I think so and with the kind of numbers that HDFC came out with, a stellar set of numbers. The NPOs below one per cent that also is a good strength that the company speaks about. Going forward, we do expect and we did touch upon the real estate sector and we expect the revival already coming into stream and definitely that is visible in cities like Pune, Hyderabad, Secunderabad twin cities, Bangalore, Mumbai. Residential properties are definitely going to have an uptake more than the commercial ones and from that point of view, a loan offtake is going to improve. If we talk about the recovery and the revival of this recession that we were in and then possibly going ahead, I do not think one should avoid HDFC in the portfolio.What would be your quick call for Monday morning given the way we shut today?I think all is not lost. I think 4930 would be the level to watch out for, but with the 4% dip. If you have a little bit of dip on Monday morning, I would definitely use opportunity to get into the market rather than run away from it."

ET Now: What is the call on markets?  Mitesh Thacker: The next few days should be more of a stock specific market. We are seeing some breakouts but on the index front, I am not very keen to buy right now. My sense is that we will evolve into a range which could still be significant but we are somewhere right now in the middle of the range. So, buying into the index may not be a very good idea. 5270-5250 is my most preferred buying level for the Nifty but on the stock side, there will be lot of action. A lot of defensive stocks have started doing very well. So, maybe this sector could possibly rule the roost as the market becomes slightly more tentative towards the event which is there on Friday. So, we will keep trading on the stock specific side."

ET Now: There has been a bit of pause in the market today. Is this really a pause and do we resume upwards may be to 6000-6100 or it will be very tight for the markets in the near term? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: If you take the rupee rally to be the genuine bull market I believe rupee may correct down to 58, and if that happens chances are Nifty, even if temporarily, will go beyond 6000. So, this would qualify as a pause, today’s low is 5858. So 5860 which has been a strong resistance on the upside, chances are 5850-5860 should act like a good support. 

 There is more rally to come now before that whether there is a three day pause or five day pause or two day pause that time will tell but this is not the right level to turn for the market and if it does it will be a signal but just in the usual course the expectation should be that we will turn somewhere above 6000 not right here."

  What is the target price on this one LT Foods?
   
  The first target would be closer to around 85. Possibly, we would look for a break out also above 85. If you have that kind of horizon - possibly 3 or 4 months - then you could look for targets of 110 or so. But right now, I think from a pure trading perspective 85 should be a good target for this one."

  Well, I think if you really look in a small cap I would go with something like a Alembic it has got everything put together in terms of good land bank. It has got good products Glycodin, its restructuring its operations so I think Rs 40-Rs 42 stock. 
  
  So I think that could give you a good return over the next 2-3 years. Its like a dark horse and otherwise I would go with the steady stock like Biocon where you have everything going for it.

Net profit rose to Rs 1,666.7 crore fromRs 1,408.9 crore a year earlier, in line with expectations. 

 “Over the last three quarters, profitability of the bank was helped by repatriation of profits from international subsidiaries which could further aid earnings,’’ said Rahul Shah, vicepresident, equity advisory group, Motilal Oswal Securities. “The bank had guided for gross stress addition of Rs 6,500 crore for FY15. Any revision in the same remains critical.’’ 

 Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and expended, increased 16% toRs 3,310 crore from Rs 2,865 crore. 

 The bank’s loan portfolio grew 16% to Rs 2.3 lakh crore at the end of the June quarter. “While we have been hoping that the economic revival will kick in, we expect it to come in the fiscal year 2016. 

 The bank will continue to see credit growth of 20%, better than the system,’’ said Somnath Sengupta, executive director and head, corporate centre. 

 Other income, a key driver in the last few quarters, remained lacklustre. 

 Other income, comprising fees, trading profit and miscellaneous income, declined 5% toRs 1,691 crore from Rs 1,781 crore. 

 This was mainly due to an 80% drop in the amount of placement and debt syndication issues handled in the quarter. However, given the recent revival in capital market activity, fee income may pick up in the next few quarters. 

 “With the change in improvement, capital market activity is looking up. Axis Capital is doing well. We managed six out of the nine qualified institutional placements that hit the market,’’ said Shikha Sharma, managing director and chief executive officer of Axis Bank. Asset quality was a disappointment. 

 Gross non-performing assets increased to 1.3% from 1.2% in the March quarter, failing to meet expectations of an improvement. Net NPAs also deteriorated a tad to 0.44% from 0.35%. Despite the rise in nonperforming loans, provisions during the quarter were down 46% to Rs 387 crore from Rs 712 crore. 

 However, lower fresh restructuring was a comforting factor this time. This stood at Rs 480 crore, the lowest in the last five quarters. 

 The bank is also keen to explore the issue of infrastructure bonds to fund."

Also, firms such as ACC and Ambuja Cements, which had expanded their capacity during the last calendar year, are reporting strong output growth now. 
  
  The combined cement dispatches of leading producers - Holcim-controlled ACC and Ambuja Cements, and Aditya Birla group's UltraTech - grew 8% year-on-year to 7.7 million tonnes in February, compared with 5.4% during April to January, FY12. 
  
  The combined capacity of ACC, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech stood at nearly 108 million tonnes at the end of the December 2011 quarter. The Indian cement industry's total capacity is expected to top 326 million tonnes at the end of FY12, say reports. 
  
  On an all-India basis, total cement dispatches grew 9.7% Y-o-Y in February and 6.5% during the April-to-February period of the current fiscal, according to brokerage reports. Increased cement output during February has also pushed up industry utilisation levels to 81%, higher on a Y-o-Y basis, say analysts. 
  
  The Union Budget's focus on developing infrastructure and on affordable and rural housing should provide a boost to cement demand over the next few quarters. 
  
  However, the new excise duty structure is estimated to put an additional burden of nearly 3 per cement bag on companies, say analysts, but this could be partially offset by the removal of basic customs duty on coal. This is because the industry meets nearly one-fourth of its coal requirements from overseas sources. 
  
  Cement companies are expected to review their prices shortly, to protect their operating margins. The new rail freight rates announced in the first week of March would lead to a nearly 20% rise in cost for cement companies, say analysts. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Cement prices have already shown an uptrend (excluding the impact of the measures announced in Union budget). For instance, in Mumbai, prices are at 320 per bag, a rise of 35 per bag in this calendar year. 
  
  Investors, however, remain optimistic on the growth prospects of this sector, with ACC, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech Cement trading not too far from their recent 52-week highs.

Cognizant beats every estimate driven by revival of US outsourcing services,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/cognizant-beats-every-estimate-driven-by-revival-of-us-outsourcing-services/articleshow/25278540.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cognizant beats every estimate driven by revival of US outsourcing services,"BANGALORE: Cognizant Technology Solutions beat its own and analysts' estimates for sales growth in the September quarter by a wide margin and said revenues will grow faster in 2013 than earlier expected.
 
 At $2.3 billion ( Rs 14,200 crore), sales grew 6.7% sequentially, driven by faster revival in demand for technology outsourcing services in the US, which makes up more than three-fourths of Cognizant's sales. As against the company's guidance of 4.1%, analysts were expecting sales to expand about 4.5% during the July-September period.
 
 
  The New Jersey-based company also said in the year to December, it now expects sales to grow at least 20.3% from ""at least 19%"" earlier. This is the second time the company is revising its full-year forecast upwards. Industry body Nasscom has projected India's $75-billion (Rs Rs 4.6 lakh crore) software services export sector to grow 12-14% during the current financial year.
 
 After strong performances from India's top IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies, which grew above market estimates, Cognizant's results are being seen as indicative of a sustainable turnaround for the industry.
 
 In the September quarter, larger rival TCS' sales grew 5.4% while Infosys revenues rose 3.8%. Cognizant's better-than-expected performance follows a 7% sequential growth - fastest among tier-one technology services companies - in the April-June quarter. Net income during the quarter was $320 million while operating profit margin was 19% of revenues. ""The key highlight of last quarter was that discretionary spends had grown materially faster at 8.6% compared to just 5.3% in maintenance activities. Continuation of such a trend will be considered an incremental positive and bears better implication for other discretionary-heavy peers like Infosys,"" said Kuldeep Kaul, lead analyst for IT services at ICICI Securities.
 
 Discretionary projects refer to desirable, but not necessary technology spending that corporations withdraw during bad times.
 
 Cognizant is also benefitting from higher spending in the healthcare industry, especially as the US is in the middle of implementing the Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare. The company has won a contract related to the Chicago health exchange. The healthcare industry vertical, which brought in about $600 million during the quarter, grew the fastest at 11%.
 
 The company said it increased its tally of strategic clients by seven to 236. Cognizant counts a client as strategic when it has the potential to ramp up to at least $5 million in annual revenues. The total number of active clients was 1,133 at the end of September.
 
 The tuck-in acquisitions the company has been doing over the past few quarters have also helped it bolster its service offerings and geographic presence. It recently acquired France-based Equinox Consulting, a financial services consulting firm for an undisclosed amount, apart from the previous acquisitions of ValueSource, a subsidiary of Belgium-based KBC group and six companies of Germany's C1 group. It added 2,100 employees during the quarter, taking the headcount to 166,400 at the end of September."

Ashwani Gujral: The holiday was good, and let us say that markets are in choppy waters. We had said that you will have upswings and downswings, and I do not think much has changed from 7400 to 7850. 

 First we went up, then came down. Again we went up. So, that process continues. 

 possibly this range will narrow down. The month of August could have further narrow ranges before the market has a clear breakout on either side. The technology stocks may again see narrow range-bound moves before retesting previous highs. 

 Between 10000 and 10500, you could have some ranging action. Bank Nifty may be bound between 14950 and about 15600-15650. So, it is basically a pause after many months of rallies. 

 Now you could have a couple of months where the market might take to a slow phase. Basically, the defensives will do well, as will pharma, IT and FMCG. 

 The next leg of the rally has to be led by cyclicals. Until that happens, we will keep hanging around, going up 400 points or coming down 500 points from time to time. According to me, that should be the course of action."

Ranbaxy reported a net profit of Rs 478 crore in the quarter ended September 30, exceeding expectations, as it swung from a year-earlier loss of Rs 454 crore. 

 The management of the company being acquired by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said it has got a marketshare of more than 30% for valsartan in the US in an investor call after announcing the results. Ranbaxy has a six-month period during which it can market valsartan exclusively before others are allowed to sell the generic. 

 The stock rose 6.11% to Rs 634.10 on the BSE on Tuesday and also triggered a 4.31% rise in Sun Pharma, which is acquiring Ranbaxy in an all-stock deal worth $4 billion. Ranbaxy’s sales rose 16.3% toRs 3,260 crore from Rs 2,802 crore in the year ago. It said sales in India rose 12%, and that overall profit was helped by higher revenue in Western Europe. 

 ""For the quarter, the company posted results better than expected on the net sales and profit front, mainly driven by the 180-day exclusivity of valsartan,"" said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice president, Angel Broking. 

 The company is looking to gain a similar advantage with another drug, although this has been delayed. ""At the moment, we believe that we maintain the marketing exclusivity opportunity on generic Nexium and will launch the product on approval,"" Ranbaxy CEO Arun Sawhney said on the investor call. 

 The company was scheduled to launch the generic version of the second-best selling drug in the US in late May, but has failed to do so. Analysts expect Ranbaxy to earn $180-250 million in the first six months if it manages to successfully launch generic Nexium in the US. 

 Ranbaxy is working to resolve quality issues that led to the US Food and Drug Administration banning imports of all drugs from the company's four Indian plants at Mohali, Toansa, Dewas and Paonta Sahib. Without giving details, the management indicated that the Mohali plant could be the first to be remediated. 

 On the many senior level exits that the company has faced in the US this month, Sawhney said, ""Exits do take place in companies. We have sufficient depth in the management and enough people to take care of US operations."" 

 Earlier this month, Ranbaxy agreed to pay $39.75 million to settle litigation related to the manner in which it historically reported pricing data to Texas Medicaid, the US healthcare programme for people with low incomes. 

 That came after the drugmaker pleaded guilty last year to felony charges relating to drug safety and agreed to pay $500 million in civil and criminal fines under a settlement with the US Department of Justice."

  Fetise.com was also one of the shortlisted start-ups at the Proto. in, an industry event for startups that took place at Chennai in July this year. 
  
  The startup was founded in March 2011 by Chetan Bafna, Abhishek Shah, Somya Tambi and Subir Ghosh, college-mates who met at the ICFAI Business School in Gurgaon. In nine months, the start-up is clocking over 500 transactions per day at a revenue run-rate of Rs 2-2.5 crore per month.
  
  Mahesh Murthy, Managing Partner of the Seed Fund, said: “What attracted us to Fetise was a clear focus on Men’s Apparel, very often we see start-ups in the e-commerce space who want to sell everything, but here they’ve picked a category and built a large product line.”
  
  Fetise.com’s product line includes men’s apparel, footwear and accessories, which has helped the company rack up average billing amount of Rs 1,500. Anand Lunia, Executive Director of the Seed-Fund, who worked closely on the deal said, “Men’s fashion is a large category and the margins in this business also makes this vertical of e-commerce far more profitable than some of the others, we are looking closely at other private labels start-up within the space.”
  
  Fetise.com has two warehouses and is planning to open more over the next 6-12 months. Chetan Bafna of Fetise.com said, “Our fundraising process started six months ago on Super Angels, and we’re overjoyed that the fundraising has closed on the TV platform too.”
  
  The next phase of Super Angels will be beginning in January 2012 with 10 start-ups making a bid to follow Fetise and raise funds successfully on the platform. Super Angels is a part of Starting Up which plays out every Tuesday at 11 PM, Saturday at 9 PM and Sunday at 10 AM."
FII exit will not hurt Nifty as retail investors take charge,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fiis-exit-will-not-hurt-nifty-as-retail-investors-take-charge/articleshow/40504754.cms,m.economictimes.com,FIIs' exit will not hurt Nifty as retail investors take charge,"MUMBAI: The Nifty is at an all-time high, thanks to short-term liquidity inflows by foreign institutional investors and as domestic investors have turned net buyers in the last couple of months. 

 FIIs have been positive on Indian equities, but if they pull out money because of global risks, that would have a negative impact on the market. 

 For those who are concerned of a sharp fall in the market if FIIs pull out US dollars in case the US increases interest rates, there is hope from domestic investors. 

 The retail investors, who had burnt their fingers in the 2008 crash, are slowing returning back to equities. 

 According to the Association of Mutual Funds of India, domestic funds have received Rs 20,784 crore since the beginning of the year, reaching the highest level in July over the past 78 months. 

 ""We believe that strong inflows of $3.3 billion into equity MFs over the past three months and the expectations of its continuation may help temper the impact of any large FII outflows, following signals of US rate normalisation and the USD strength,"" said a Deutsche Bank report. 

 According to analysts, a lot of investors, who were waiting on the sidelines for the election outlook, have started coming in, but the real big retail money has still not come in a big way. 

 ""Investors normally look at the past three years return in any asset class before they really come in a big way and equities have now given good returns for the last one year. Going by that track record, we should see decent flows coming in the next one or two years and that will be good in terms of balancing out the FII flows,"" said Mahesh Patil, Co-CIO, Birla Sunlife MF, to ET Now. 

 The domestic participation picking up is largely because India now has advantage of a stable government, the policy environment is a lot more conducive, macroeconomic fundamentals have improved significantly and business confidence is getting restored. 

 ""We continue to be in an envious position as opposed to other emerging market economies, whether it is Brazil or whether it is China. Our growth and economic activity is slowly starting to bottom out and we are again inching closer to easing of the monetary cycle,"" said Arindam Ghosh, CEO, BlackRidge Capital Advisors. 

 If the foreign investors stay put and the retail participation increases, Indian markets may see a phenomenal rise. 

 ""This constant net buying of foreigners has been a feature. The competing factor this year will be the locals returning to the market. I do not see the foreigners wanting to reduce their position. So the markets look technically very attractive,"" said Adrian Mowat, Chief EM & Asian Equity Strategist. 

 Retail investors are known to take positions in broader markets. With the sharp surge in mid-and-small caps in the past few months, analysts are advising retail investors to be selective in stock buying approach. 

 ""They need to get a little selective when it comes to taking exposure. Some of the stocks have run up quite significantly. They should stick to large caps, quality midcaps, and fundamentally sound companies over the next three-four years,"" Ghosh added."
Finolex on a roll after renewing its focus on pipe business,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/finolex-on-a-roll-after-renewing-its-focus-on-pipe-business/articleshow/30757502.cms,m.economictimes.com,Finolex on a roll after renewing its focus on pipe business,"Two years of stagnation and margin erosion forced India’s top PVC pipes and fittings maker, Finolex Industries, to reinvent itself to stage a comeback.
 
 The company not only recovered its profits in FY13 to FY10 levels, but further doubled them in the April-December ’13 period. Its market capitalisation has nearly tripled over the past one year, signalling that things are on the mend.
 
 The company’s problems in the past emanated from its huge exposure to the commodity PVC business, which it entered as part of a backward integration course. But now there is a renewed focus on pipes, which was its main forte.
 
 “We will end FY14 with a capacity of 230,000 tonnes of pipes against 270,000 tonne of PVC resin capacity,” Saurabh Dhanorkar, managing director of the company told ET.
 
 The company plans to add another 100,000-tonne pipes capacity over the next three years,” he said. Simultaneously, Finolex is trying to improve margins in the pipes business, where it enjoys a strong brand value.
 
 “In the last six quarters, we have slowly increased the prices of our PVC pipes to raise margins from 5% to 8%, with a plan to take them to 10%,” Dhanorkar said. This has clearly reflected in the company’s improved margins in the past few quarters.
 
 The decision to reduce its foreign exchange exposure and to hedge, after seeing the impact on its earnings in the past, has also helped.
 
 “We used to take 360 days credit from overseas suppliers in the past, which was unhedged, exposing us to great foreign exchange volatility. We cut that to 90 days now, while hedging 70% of our exposure, so we won’t have any volatility in earnings,” Dhanorkar said.
 
 The company is also set to exploit the potential in PVC fittings, which is a fast growing, high-margin business with limited competition. It has expanded its jetty in Ratnagiri to import coal, chemical as well as cryogenic cargos and set up a 43-MW captive power plant, leading to cost savings.
 
 More importantly, the company is not planning any major investments in the next couple of years.
 
 It aims to focus only on brownfield expansions at three locations — Baroda, Pune and Ratnagiri — at a substantially lower capital expenditure.
 
 According to Dhanorkar, Finolex generates over Rs 300 crore of cash annually and will become debt-free in three years. The company pared onethird of its debt in the past one year toRs 660 crore at end September ’13.
 
 The demand for PVC pipes in India appears to be rising, especially due to the vast un-irrigated agricultural land and usage in construction for plumbing and sewerage.
 
 And to tap more markets, Finolex has already set up a network of 15,000 dealers.
 
 Through all these measures, Finolex is on course to report a steady improvement in its margins even if the topline remains flattish as its current PVC resin sales get converted to more value-added pipes. However, lower capital expenditure and higher margins will result in a marked improvement in return on investment, which could signal a good longterm investment."

FMCGs to take big hit from possible FII outflow: UR Bhat,negative,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/fmcgs-to-take-big-hit-from-possible-fii-outflow-ur-bhat/articleshow/26354283.cms,m.economictimes.com,FMCGs to take big hit from possible FII outflow: UR Bhat,"In a chat with ET Now, UR Bhat, MD, Dalton Capital Advisors shares his views on the FMCGs. Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: Do you think the springtime for FMCG is over because with the exception of United Spirits, all the major FMCG stocks are underperforming markets, ITC is sitting at a fresh six-week low, HUL has done nothing and Britannia has lost about Rs 100 plus from the recent high? 

 
UR Bhat: Looks like that, because as I said in the case of IT, here also the bulk of the capital appreciation that one could derive has already happened and if there is going to be some sort of FII outflow, this is one of the big sectors which would probably get affected and on a valuation argument, it is not very strong in respect of FMCG because despite they having done very well on the stock front, valuations look a bit stretched. So at the first sign of FIIs exiting, this sector might actually give way a bit."

"Godawari Power & Ispat: Pellet sales, mining key drivers for company",positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/godawari-power-ispat-pellet-sales-mining-key-drivers-for-company/articleshow/15610783.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,"Godawari Power & Ispat: Pellet sales, mining key drivers for company","Higher pellet volumes and better realisations from a decent product portfolio have led to an improved performance by Godawari Power & Ispat, or GPL. In the coming quarters, pellet volumes should rise while prices stay firm.
 
 The June 2012 quarter results showed an improvement on all fronts -- consolidated net sales rose 22% and the EBIDTA grew 44.4 % YoY, mainly due to a 130% rise in pellet sales. A 15% improvement in realisations across products, except power, was also a major contributor to the stellar performance.
 
 The rise in pellet volumes owed to iron ore mines operating at a utilisation rate of over 100%. Additionally, a dip in availability of sponge iron grade ore meant that more of the iron ore the company produces could be used for pellet production.
 
 Moreover, Ardent Steel, in which the company has a 75% stake, also witnessed an improvement in utilisation rate as it overcame teething issues at its mines, which started production in the latter half of FY10.
 
 The cost of coal has been a cause of concern for the company in the past. However, its 26% stake in Nakia coalmine will ensure that the needs of its captive power unit are met. It will also hedge it from fluctuations in coal prices over the next two years.
 
 The iron mines in Boria Tibu and Dhalli Rajhara, Chhattisgarh will supplement its iron ore mines in Ari Dongri, which currently meet 70-80% of the company's iron ore requirements.
 
 Going forward, a further increase in pellet sales, including a higher 95% utilisation rate at Ardent Steel, and iron ore mining operations are going to be the value drivers for the company. The only cause of concern is the power division.
 
 A rise in coal prices, due to dependence on e-auction and imported coal, on the one hand and falling merchant power prices on the other have resulted in revenue and margins falling at the power division. The ability of the company to switch focus from the power business to steel will help it maintain the good show.
 
 The GPL stock has performed well in the past eight months, with the price appreciating by 80% from a low of Rs 69.50. However, at a price of Rs 125.50 per share, it still trades at a low PE of 1.8x and an EV/EBIDTA of 3.2x."

ET Now: I was asking you about the RBI norms that got released yesterday which will allow persons with banking experience or NBFCs in general to set up banks as well. What did you make of those because the NBFCs have reacted today? 

 
Dipan Mehta: That also is positive and we have been getting news flow and that come from the RBI. But these are more of long term in nature and they will take some time before they actually start having an effect on the performance of these specific NBFCs. But what we have in place is that, we have a finance minister and RBI governor both who want to make things far better for the financial services sector and to channelise savings into the capital market into financial assets. 

 So one side whatever is required to be done at the government end is being done and then RBI is also in its own way carrying out a lot of reforms. Be it allowing new bank licenses, the payment banks as they describe it or for that matter what they did as far as infrastructure funding is concerned by providing exemptions or relaxations on SLR, CRR. So both institutions, the government and the RBI, working in tandem and that is very positive per se for the banks. 

 But my sense is that banks, NBFCs are also doing better because some of the threats which were impacting, likely to impact the economy that being oil prices per se and secondly the monsoon are gradually getting dissolved. Oil prices are back to where they were about few weeks ago or few months ago and we are within reach as far as diesel pricing and diesel subsidy is concerned. That is more or less over and done with and last two-three days monsoon also progressed pretty well. So these are the two indicators which will benefit the domestic economy and once domestic economy starts doing well, then automatically banks are the best sector to benefit from that. So not just RBI and what the budget has offered to NBFCs, but the fact that the threats regarding to monsoon and oil prices has also improved the sentiment within the cyclicals.

Gujarat Pipavav Port Net doubles to Rs 89.5 crore in July-September,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/gujarat-pipavav-port-net-doubles-to-rs-89-5-crore-in-july-september/articleshow/45047248.cms,m.economictimes.com,Gujarat Pipavav Port Net doubles to Rs 89.5 crore in July-September,"MUMBAI: The Gujarat Pipavav Port today said its net profit jumped by two-fold to Rs 89.50 crore in the July-September quarter on volume growth and dividend income from its rail subsidiary. 

 ""We received Rs 16 crore in dividend income from our rail subsidiary which is a public private partnership and the volumes increased by 19 per cent,"" its managing director Prakash Tulsiani told PTI. 

 The company, in which global port operator APM Terminals has a majority stake, had increased rates by 7 per cent in August last year, and the full quarter impact of the rate hike was visible in the July-September period, he said. 

 Total income increased to Rs 189.30 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, from Rs 133.60 crore for the same quarter last year. 

 On volumes front, Tulsiani said the container volumes grew 19 per cent over the last year to 194,000 standard units but declined by 4 per cent when compared with the preceding June quarter on a dip in exports. 

 The company also added two services calling at the port which pushed up the volumes, he said. 

 It witnessed a 23 per cent rise in bulk cargo handling during the quarter at 1.01 million tonnes, but Tulsiani said that this was an one-off quarter and the total bulk cargo handled by the port in the first nine months of the year is the same as last year. 

 ""With bulk cargo, you may witness one quarter when there is a rise,"" he said, adding that the port continues to maintain its cautious approach on the bulk front. 

 It can be noted that the company had surprised all by announcing a withdrawal of capacity addition on the bulk front earlier this year. It is, however, going ahead with its planned expansion on the container front. 

 Tulsiani said that the company has embarked on the USD 100 million capacity expansion on container side and is targeting to finish it by March 2016. 

 The container handling capacity will increase to 1.35 million standard units from the current 850,000 TEUs, he said. 

 The port's liquid cargo handling capacity also started delivering revenues during the reporting quarter, he said, adding, it currently constitutes a small percentage of revenues.

The recent run-up seen in equity markets suggests that the markets are pricing in some probability of the BJP-led NDA leading the race, say analysts.
 
 Tracking the momentum, most of the Gujarat-based stocks have caught the fancy of investors and funds ever since the BJP announced Modi as its PM candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha election, on September 13.
 
 According to analysts, it is a prudent strategy to bet on stocks ahead of elections for short-term gains, but for long term they should look at fundamentals before taking their call.
 
 Siddharth Sedani, Vice President - PMS at Microsec Capital Ltd, is of the view that Gujarat-based companies have already run up in the last 3-6 months. Investors should bet on these companies on sentimental boost.
 
 Most of the Gujarat-based stocks have already rallied 30-170 per cent in the run up to the election results, which include names like Torrent Power, GSPL, Adani Ports, Adani Power, Adani Enterprises etc. (See table below).
 
 Adani Enterprises has been the clear winner, rallying as much as 170 per cent in a matter of just 7 months, followed by Arvind which gained 116 per cent in the same period.
 
 The BSE Sensex has rallied over 14 per cent or nearly 3000 points since September, while the 50-share Nifty index also managed to climb over 16 per cent or nearly 1000 points, as of data collected from Sep 13.
 
 The recent run-up seen in markets is supported by the hope that opinion polls are correct in pointing to a victory for the centre-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is widely perceived as more business-friendly and especially with the current chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, nominated as the party’s prime ministerial candidate.
 
 Nomura sees a 75 per cent probability of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance securing a solid enough plurality to pull together a majority coalition, under the leadership of Narendra Modi.
 
 “I think stocks based out of Gujarat are up largely on account of expectations of Modi becoming the prime minister. Chartically though some of these stocks are in a strong uptrend and can be bought for some profits in the near term,” said Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com.
 
 To buy into equities before the Lok Sabha election results are announced is the right strategy. Some of the Gujarat-based stocks are making fresh record highs on a daily basis, but the idea should be to pick names with sound fundamentals, say experts.
 
 “While the large cap space is sufficiently owned by FIIs, the small and mid-cap space seems to be lean in terms of institutional ownership,” said Shashank Khade, Director and Chief Equity Advisor, Entrust Family Office Investment Advisor.
 
 “I feel if a stable government is in place, there will be a rush towards capex-oriented stocks, potential beneficiaries of revival of capex cycle & renewed infrastructure thrust,” he added.
 
 
We have compiled a list of ten stocks which have shown tremendous strength since September 2013:
 
 
  
 
 Have stocks run-up ahead of fundamentals?
 
 Most experts do feel that most of the Gujarat-based stocks have certainly run-up ahead of fundamentals and some bit of corrections is expected once the results come out. So investors should tread with caution.
 
 Well, a few of the Gujarat-based companies which have strong business franchise with reasonable financial can have robust upside going forward on the positive outcome of election results.
 
 Sedani of Microsec Capital Ltd is of the view that as anticipated, the next government may bring debottlenecking and simplify policies which may propel few companies as turnaround contenders. However, how much that will help individual business, that remains to be seen.
 
 “It is true that the stock prices of the companies which have base in Gujarat are outperforming the indices, irrespective of their fundamentals,” said Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services.
 
 “However, I believe that the investors should consider the fundamentals before investing, because investments just based on speculations could badly impact the portfolio returns,” he added.
 
 A punting stock could be able to give significant returns in a very less time. However, would not be able to sustain these gains with time, exposing investor with the risk of possible loss, he explains.
 
 Analysts are not denying the fact that it could be possible that Gujarat-based stocks could report new highs. However, those which have weak fundamentals could quickly erase these gains and collapse in a similar way after the results.
 
 Before committing to any stock, investors should look at each stock based on its business fundamentals and then look at its current market price to determine whether it is undervalued or overvalued given the fundamentals, says Dr. Vikas V Gupta (Head- Research & Product Development), ArthVeda.
 
 
Top bets
 
 
Adani Enterprises: This stock has more than doubled investors’ wealth in a matter of just seven months, and analysts see the stock trending towards Rs 475 odd levels. Traders should stay put and keep revising stop losses as the stock gains further momentum.
 
 
Arvind: The stock has had a sharp uptrend in the last few months and we expect the stock to continue on the current trajectory, although may lose a bit of pace. Saraogi of Equityrush.com suggests profit booking on Arvind at the current levels.
 
 
Adani Ports: The company is one of the major contributors in infrastructure development in the past 10 years in Gujarat and analysts believe that the current run up in the stock price could be as a result of perceived favorable impact due to change in government.
 
 “The fundamentals of the company also justify stock re-rating since any favorable economic data could prove beneficial to the company due to higher growth in revenues due to manufacturing and export thrust in the medium term,” said Pendharkar of Right Horizons Financial Services.
 
 
Adani Power: This stock has also seen a sharp run in the past couple of months. However, Saraogi of Equityrush.com says that the stock faces stiff resistance around Rs 60. Traders would do well to book some profits at current levels.
 
 
SPL, Gujarat Alkalies & GMDC: These stocks look interesting based on valuations and given the fact that the equity market rally started to broaden, value buying will potentially emerge in these companies where-in the balance sheets are strong, say analysts.
 
 Apart from the above stocks, Khade of Entrust Family Office Investment Advisor says that PSU stocks are expected to be re-rated in terms of valuations on expectations of better governance of the Central government. PSU stocks and infrastructure-related stocks may get a boost due to a stable government at the Centre, he added."
Highway developers party on dull Dalal Street; stocks have more upside,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/highway-developers-party-on-dull-dalal-street-stocks-have-more-upside/articleshow/49842123.cms,m.economictimes.com,Highway developers party on dull Dalal Street; stocks have more upside,"NEW DELHI: Roads and highways sector stocks have been witnessing a dream run in an otherwise lackluster market, with some of them gaining up to 80 per cent so far this calendar.
 
 Strong government support to the stalled projects, deferment of premium payment to the government, relaxation of the exit clause for investors and modification of the model concession agreement (MCA) have improved the outlook for the roads and highways developers.
 
 This stocks have also witnessed increased interest from FIIs. Data available with NSDL showed FII exposure to the roads and highways sector has climbed to Rs 2,902 crore as of October 15 from Rs 2,622 crore at the end of 2014.
 
 Yet, analysts say the party has just begun and these stocks have way to go.
 
 In a fresh move on Wednesday, the government allowed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to compensate road developers for delays not attributable to them. This will potentially unlock investment of nearly Rs 35,000 crore in 34 stalled projects.
 
 The government has also empowered the road transport and highways ministry to approve projects with civil construction cost up to Rs 1,000 crore, taking out land cost from it to speed up decision making, said a report in Economic Times.
 
 “The announcements continue the trend of favourable policy decisions for the road space. The deferment of premium, relaxation of exit clause, modification in the model concession agreement (MCA) and the government’s support to stalled projects have already provided comfort to road sector players. We believe project awards in the road space will gather more steam going ahead,” Edelweiss Securities said in a note.
 
 The brokerage prefers contractors like KNR Constructions and developers with strong financial health, such as Sadbhav Engineering and Ashoka Buildcon.
 
 Road construction stock KNR Constructions has surged 83.10 per cent year to date compared with a 0.02 per cent drop in the BSE smallcap index and an 11 per cent fall in Nifty infrastructure index. J Kumar Infraprojects has climbed 44.22 per cent this calendar.
 
 Sadbhav Engineering, a midcap road sector stock, has surged 22 per cent during this period, while Ashoka Buildcon has risen 23 per cent.
 
 Some others have, however, fallen behind. Among them are Simplex Infrastructures (down 13.52 per cent) and IRB Infra (down 5 per cent).
 
 “Government initiatives over the past two years have increased funding and attractiveness of the sector. It has tripled the road cess (a form of tax) to $3.5 billion to boost funding for EPC projects. With many projects stuck due to land issues, it has mandated that bids are awarded only after the NHAI has procured 80 per cent of the land for build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects and 90 per cent for EPC projects,” foreign brokerage CLSA said in a note.
 
 Additionally, the government has proposed easier project exits for developers, deferment of premium payments to NHAI, decentralised project clearances and formulated a new road award model (hybrid annuity) besides offering new modes of financing, namely infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), to unclog the sector.
 
 CLSA believes asset-light E&C firms with good balance sheets and select asset owners and gatekeepers will be the key beneficiaries of these structural change in the sector. The brokerage has initiated a buy rating for J Kumar Sadbhav Engineering, and has an outperform rating for Nagarjuna.
 
 “We also highlight compelling asset owner IRB Infra. Further, non-rated KNR Construction and MBL are pure and inexpensive ideas to play the rebound in the construction cycle,” it said."
HSIL Q3 turnaround in building products division may trigger a re-rating,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hsil-q3-turnaround-in-building-products-division-may-trigger-a-re-rating/articleshow/45832820.cms,m.economictimes.com,HSIL Q3 turnaround in building products division may trigger a re-rating,"Despite an year-on-year (y-o-y) increase of 109 per cent in net profit, the market was unhappy with the second quarter performance of HSIL. It was because the company reported a 1 per cent decline in revenue from its core building products division. Its decision to exit the tiles business due to poor margins was the main reason for this fall in revenue. Efforts to reduce the trade receivables and excessive build up of inventory with the dealers was another reason for this fall. After the successful reduction in dealer inventory, the dealer despatches have re-started. Due to a good demand for its faucets, HSIL has also ramped up production at its newly-commissioned faucetware unit. Analysts are now expecting more than 20 per cent y-o-y revenue growth from the building product division in the third quarter.
 
 
  Given that the sanitaryware and faucets industry is still at a nascent stage in India—around 70 per cent of rural households don’t have decent sanitary options— the long-term demand outlook remains robust. While increased aspiration levels will drive HSILs growth in urban areas, urbanisation and a shift from joint to nuclear families will drive its rural growth. The expected pickup in the economy should also help the building products industry in the coming years.
 
 

 
 HSIL’s packaging product division continues to do well and is expected to see more than 25 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter. Packaging division’s y-o-y third quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are also expected to move up by 200 basis points due to better capacity utilisation and the impact of price hikes undertaken in the container glass division in the second quarter. Having undertaken capacity expansions, HSIL now plans to bring down its debt levels. It has already received shareholder approval to raise Rs 250 crore through equity and it is expected to be used to cut debt.
 
 Reduced interest cost will also increase its net profit in the coming years. As per the consensus estimate, HSIL’s net profit is expected to jump from Rs 34 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 130 crore in 2015-16, an annualised growth of 95 per cent.
 
 Though the counter was performing much better than the market, it started underperforming after the lacklustre second quarter numbers. A decisive turnaround from building products division in the third quarter can be the trigger for the counter. The current low valuation is another reason for this rerating— despite its high growth rates, it is still quoting only at 19 times its expected 2015-16 earnings per share.
 
 Selection methodology We pick up the stock that has shown the maximum increase in ‘consensus analyst rating’ in the past one month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that the analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search is restricted to stocks that are covered by at least 10 analysts."

  Sale of soaps and detergents fell by 2.42% to Rs 2,072 crore, but HUL insisted that the glass was half full, pointing out in a statement that “actions to restore competitiveness in soaps and mass laundry yielded positive results, with the segment returning to volume growth during the quarter”. HUL makes Lifebuoy, Lux, Breeze and Liril soaps and Surf, Rin and Wheel laundry detergents. Net profit increased by 5% to Rs 649.1 crore, aided by exceptional gains from the sale of property during the quarter. Net sales grew 4.56% from a year ago to Rs 4,504.2 crore.
  
  
  HUL has been losing market share and shedding volumes in key segments such as soaps, tea and toothpaste in the past few quarters to aggressive smaller rivals. The company has responded with price cuts, relaunched brands and stepped up spending on advertising and promotions.
  
  
  “Volume growth accelerated in the quarter backed by quality innovations, increased brand support and continued focus on market execution,” chairman Harish Manwani said. Domestic consumer and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales grew by 5%, helped by growth in personal products, foods and water. Personal care product sales grew 16%, led by strong winter sales of skincare and haircare brands.
  
  
  Price cuts in soaps and laundry products such as Lux and Wheel helped restore volume growth during the quarter.
  
  
  Underlying operating profit grew 5% and operating margin excluding mark-to-market accounting impact on forex exposure improved 10 basis points to 16.8%. Excluding mark-to-market, profit after tax was flat.
  
  
  “Gross margins were at healthy levels and the cost of raw material was down 480 basis points. The underlying operating margin was up. Cost-saving programmes and buying efficiencies had also helped improve the margin,” CFO R Sridhar said. HUL may also introduce more brands from parent Unilever’s global portfolio in line with the market trends.
  
  
  The company is selling several residential and commercial properties across India to cut costs and raise cash. It has shifted its headquarters to Mumbai’s Andheri western suburb and will lease out its former headquarters in South Mumbai to either corporates or banks after refurbishing it, a company executive said."

"Improved margins, declining prices make cement stocks attractive: Motilal Oswal Securities",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/improved-margins-declining-prices-make-cement-stocks-attractive-motilal-oswal-securities/articleshow/15434733.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Improved margins, declining prices make cement stocks attractive: Motilal Oswal Securities","MUMBAI: Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities expects cement companies to do well on the back of improved margins, declining prices of imported coal and stabilized freight charges. The broking firm holds positive outlook for cement companies and expects meaningful upgrades over the next few quarters.
 
 ""Given our positive outlook, we have upgraded our earnings estimates by 4-11% for ACC, Ambuja and UltraTech, backed by 10-12% upward revision in realization assumptions,"" the MOSL report said.
 
 Top cement majors have reported strong numbers in the first quarter thanks to improvement in operations and margins. The robust performance is attributable to strong quarter-on-quarter improvement in realisations (about 6-8%) and in-line stable volumes.
 
 ""We believe that the worst is behind for the cement industry. We expect gradual and consistent improvement in capacity utilization and operating performance. Long-term demand drivers remain in place,"" the MOSL report said.
 
 After the recent outperformance, cement stocks are trading at historical average valuations, leaving limited room for further re-rating. MOSL analysts expect strong earnings growth to drive stock performance from current price levels. The brokerage has named Ambuja Cement, UltraTech and Shree Cement as its top sectoral picks.
 
 Cement prices improved by Rs 5 - 10 per bag month-on-month across regions in June 2012 after a temporary blip in May 2012. MOSL analysts saw no seasonal moderation in July 2012. """"Stable demand scenario and weak monsoon have supported cement prices even during the seasonally weak period,"""" the report said.
 
 Moderation is coal prices has also helped cement companies significantly. Energy cost moderated for select companies owing to reduction of imported coal prices though meaningfully diluted by depreciating rupee. We see limited cost pressures hereon, except for potential increase in diesel prices, the report said.
 
 Although current cement prices are at peak, they need to increase further to generate economic returns for new plants. Current cement prices are still Rs 40 per bag below the longer-term viable pricing. """"We believe higher capex cost of upcoming supplies will provide strong support to cement prices,"""" the MOSL report said.
 
 However, MOSL analysts feel any sort of government intervention could upset the apple cart of most cement companies.

ET Now: Nifty managed to hold on to 8,280 levels on the expiry day. Does the level still remain the key pivot around which you would have your trading strategies for the Nifty?
 
 
Ashwani Gujral: On the expiry day, even Chinese markets tried to weigh on the sentiment, but the 8280 level on Nifty did not break. The good news is that both CNX IT and Bank Nifty are showing a decent amount of strength. They are not showing any weakness.
 
 Hence, one can build chances of index hitting 8,450 soon. That said, anything can happen if the 50-pack index starts breaking 8,280 decisively. In the ongoing decline, all the three indices are now holding on to their 20-day moving averages.
 
 That is extremely positive. I would qualify this as chances of the index moving higher."

"Interim Budget impact: Markets get a boost, ratings cut worry ebbs",positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/interim-budget-impact-markets-get-a-boost-ratings-cut-worry-ebbs/articleshow/30614655.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,"Interim Budget impact: Markets get a boost, ratings cut worry ebbs","NEW DELHI: The good thing about the interim Budget was that it did not throw up any negative surprises and made a point that India's economy is on a firm ground, say experts.

""At least the Budget did not make things worse,"" Arnab Das of Das Capital tells ET Now.

""Things are somewhat more stable and somewhat stronger across the emerging market universe, mainly because the US dollar is weaker; and in turn that owes to the string of weak US data which suggests that even if the Fed does not dial down the speed of the tapering, the forward guidance about rates remaining at zero for a long time is going to become more credible. So, that is imparting a little bit more stability to emerging markets as a whole.""

A day after Finance Minister P Chidambaram presented interim Budget, the 30-stock Sensex is trading with gains of over 150 points as of 12:09 pm, suggesting that the market may not be overly optimistic but is for sure on a soild ground given the state of the economy.

""Broad numbers clearly have a solid base now, thanks to the kind of conclusion of this particular round of earnings call that we saw. Also, with the inflation broadly under control and currency very stable. Even in vote on account, the finance minister's commitment was very-very strong that we got to have a very controlled fiscal discipline kind of a situation and controlled inflation"" says Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD & Co Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

He says the probability of markets heading southward is limited, but the upside can be anything. ""My sense is that we have a very reasonable valuation and very promising election going ahead. I would be surprised if there's a downside from here; I mean that the upside could be anything, but downside is very-very limited,"" he says.

What was in the Budget that is making investors confident?

""It was an absolutely wonderful performance, because it is the first time we saw a government cutting 70-80 thousand crore of expenditure in election year. I do not think it has happened ever before. This shows the fiscal prudence that has now started to come into the political system and that is a great relief,"" says Ajay Srivastava, CEO Dimensions Consulting.

Given this, how strong is the possibility of the markets rallying ahead of general elections?

""You have the elections, and from a domestic perspective the focus would increasingly shift there ... a lot of investors we spoke to have called elections a binary event. So, opinions are divided on whether there would be a rally before the elections,"" says Tirthankar Patnaik, Director, Strategist-Institutional Research, Religare Capital Markets.


	 
A big positive from the Budget has been that the worry over a possible ratings cut seems to have ebbed.

""The current account deficit was a worry; but it has now corrected itself. So, the balance of risks is stable,"" says Atsi Sheth, VP-Sovereign Risk Group, Moody's.

Any negative from the Budget could have well tilted the scales unfavourably.

""What we have seen in the recent data is that inflation appears to be abating, at least in the near term; and that is one thing that the RBI will monitor. The other thing that the RBI had pointed to, not just recently but in the past as well, is that look fiscal deficit feeds inflation; so, fiscal consolidation is something that they are also monitoring. In terms of headline numbers, the deficit has been brought down, the borrowing requirement consequently is lower,"" says Atsi Sheth.

On a cautious note, he says, ""but again, risks remain. There is still volatility for the rupee ... food prices are very hard to predict and those could feed inflation. So, the balance of risk is still leaning towards a still-high inflation,"" he says.

Also, global rating agency Fitch had earlier warned that unchecked fiscal deficit and high inflation could lead to a negative rating action.

With both looking under check now, thanks to the figures presented in the Budget, the threat of a ratings downgrade looks abating; the only threat being an unfavourable election mandate.

Chidambaram's interim Budget has put the fiscal deficit for 2013-14 at 4.6% of the GDP, as against the target of 4.8%.

Also, it projected next year's target at 4.1%."
Investors should opt for higher exposure to PSU banks: Kunj Bansal,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/investors-should-opt-for-higher-exposure-to-psu-banks-kunj-bansal/articleshow/34523970.cms,m.economictimes.com,Investors should opt for higher exposure to PSU banks: Kunj Bansal,"In a chat with ET Now, Kunj Bansal, ED & CIO, Centrum Wealth Management, shares his views on bank stocks.
 
 
ET Now: There is currently huge volatility not only in the market, but separately within the banking segment also. What would you prefer now, private sector banks or PSU banks, keeping it in mind that PSU banks are going to give more returns once the economy recovers?
 
 
Kunj Bansal: The ideal approach would be to build a mix of the two. Now, what percentage of private sector bank stocks and how much of PSU ones — one has to decide on his own. One has to consider the fact that the public sector banks today are offering a valuation comfort despite a rise in the last two or two-and-a-half months. A lot of banks are trading close to price book of one and even lesser. That is where the percentage-return opportunity is higher compared to private sector banks. Within PSU banks, apart from Bank of Baroda, the other attractive name is Union Bank. So, these are the stocks one should look at. I would recommend that investors, especially short-term investors, build a higher percentage of exposure in PSU banks.
 
 
ET Now: The numbers for OBC do not look good. NPAs have gone up and net interest margins have contracted. Besides, the management commentary is weak too. I wonder why market men are buying into PSU banks. 

 
Kunj Bansal: Very true. It would not be prudent to believe that because of the recent movement in the public sector bank suddenly their quarterly results will also start looking good. In the momentum of the market we tend to forget the fundamentals. In terms of this quarter's numbers, not much change is expected, particularly as far as NPA are concerned. What the market typically does is place bets at least six months ahead. What is more, All expectations of market recovery are hinged on the hopes of a stable government. Talking of the hopes of an economic recovery, when recovery takes place some of the NPAs also recover. 

 So, hopefully a recovery will happen. If not, investors in the market will go wrong this time as well. It is not that this will be the first time, because investors go wrong all the time.

ET Now: Which is a stronger trader – buying into defensives like IT, etc, the way we spoke about it at closing or just staying away and maybe waiting for lower levels and buy into some of the cyclicals?
 
 Ashwani Gujral: IT can be bought because IT is looking positive as the rupee is looking negative, so that trade probably continues and the market is not falling all that much because 7580 was earlier support where it kind of found support for four days, now it has fallen, it has found a level of 7500 where it has found support for about four days now.
 
 So what is happening is that without falling, we are tending to correct and in this process the 20-day moving average is slowly moving towards the market which is now about 7489.
 
 We should be happy with that but clearly rupee is looking extremely weak and that means that IT should find support around these levels and maybe look at 9750-9800 on CNX IT in the days to come.
 
 While not participating and standing on the sidelines is a choice people can exercise but if there is an opportunity to make some money, it should be taken and it is definitely not being short on the market or an individual stocks because reversals in a bull market are fairly sharp and you will end up getting trapped in stocks like HP, BP like people figured out on Friday."

A key reason behind it is that the current government's chances to come back to power after elections have improved following India’s military standoff with Pakistan. That is why the broader market has seen buying. As a result, midcaps have rebounded strongly. 

The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices have gained 4.4 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in the past two weeks, compared to the Sensex which is up 2.2 per cent during the same period. In 2018, BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices had fallen 13.4 per cent and 23.7 per cent, respectively. Also, there were macro headwinds and concerns about corporate governance and liquidity issues and there was lack of pick-up in earnings growth. Analysts believe the tide seems to be turning in favour of the broader market again. 

“Typically, the spread between large-cap and mid-cap returns has peaked out at 15-20 per cent. Post hitting this peak range, the performance has reversed in the past.

CLSA



SADBHAV ENGINEERING

Change in last one year : -41.8 per cent

Despite the recent 44 per cent rally since its low, Sadbhav Engineering’s stock trades at 7 times FY20 adjusted earnings and its valuation appears attractive, said foreign brokerage CLSA. The brokerage has added the midcap stock to its portfolio.


SOBHA
CMP: Rs 438.7
Change in last one year : -20 per cent

Sobha is another midcap in CLSA’s model portfolio. The foreign brokerage said the launch of Sobha’s second affordable project should help drive sales in the near term. “Sobha’s timely new launches amidst tough liquidity conditions for developers should help it gain market share significantly. ” said CLSA in a recent report, while retaining buy rating with a target price of Rs 628.


GODREJ PROPERTIES
CMP: Rs 699.55
Change in last one year : -6.7 per cent

Godrej Properties delivered good operating performance in the third quarter and this performance comes amidst tight liquidity for the sector, demonstrating Godrej’s strength and ability to gain from the ongoing sector consolidation, said CLSA. Access to cheap liquidity, a good delivery trackrecord and its timely expansion make Godrej well poised to gain market share, said CLSA.


MOTILAL OSWAL


INDRAPRASTHA GAS
CMP: Rs 293.35

Indraprastha Gas is one of Motilal Oswal’s preferred midcap ideas. The brokerage said in a recent report that Indraprastha Gas’ consistent operational outperformance, the government’s thrust on gas usage, and sustainable high-growth market warrant premium valuations. The recent Supreme Court ruling for Indraprastha to take over the assets of Haryana City Gas Distribution is another positive from the short- to medium-term volume growth perspective, said Motilal Oswal.


FEDERAL BANK
CMP: Rs 87.65
Change in last one year : -5.8 per cent

Federal Bank has maintained strong business momentum and it is reporting a gradual improvement in operating earnings. Strong capitalization levels and a robust liability franchise will enable market share gains in both corporate and retail segments, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 115.


SUN TV NETWORK
CMP: Rs 596.35
Change in last one year : -33.4 per cent

Motilal Oswal expects 12 per cent compounded growth in advertisement revenue over FY19 -FY21 on the back of new launches and increasing share of commission model-based shows. This, coupled with a foray in the Bangla genre, augurs well for the company, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report on Sun TV. Burgeoning IPL revenue is also expected to provide a fillip to overall revenue, it added.


CITIGROUP
SRF
CMP: Rs 2,351.85

SRF is among Citi’s top midcap ideas. SRF’s unique fluorine chemistry skills, history of innovation and operational management track-record, along with its proven ability to extract profits from even commoditized businesses, provide a long growth runway, said Citi.


SHRIRAM TRANSPORT FINANCE CO.
CMP: Rs 1,220.30

Shriram Transport’s niche focus on used vehicle segment and diversified borrowing profile positions it better to navigate through the liquidity challenges and tide over the cyclical nature of vehicle industry, said Citi.

However, the management's stance to keep dollar denominated revenue guidance unchanged at 6-10% growth for the fiscal reflects that caution is still the buzzword. 

 Infosys, the second largest among the IT exporters that are listed on Indian bourses, reported 7.8% sequential growth in revenue at Rs 11,267 crore for the June 2013 quarter, surpassing the analysts' average estimate of 5.5% growth. The ET Intelligence Group (ETIG) had predicted 6.7% sequential increase in revenue. 

 Operating profit or earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) however lagged the ETIG's estimation of Rs 2,778.4 crore. The company reported Rs 2,664 crore in EBIT, a sequential growth of 8.2%. 

 The company was able to retain the operating margin calculated as the proportion of EBIT in the revenue at 23.6% compared with the previous quarter. For the September 2013 quarter, however, its CFO Rajiv Bansal has cited a negative impact of around 300 basis points on profitability due to the salary hikes of average 8% initiated at the beginning of July. 

 The stock market has reacted positively to the results. At Rs 2,810, the stock has gained over 11% in the morning session on Friday. The big jump can be attributed to a sharp increase in the rupee denominated revenue guidance by the company to 13-17% for the fiscal from the earlier forecast of 6-10% growth. 

 The company has been finding it difficult to report meaningful growth since the past few years. Against the backdrop, what could offer some relief to investors is the fact that it reported a strong 4.1% volume growth for the quarter, which is the largest since the September 2011 quarter when it had reported 4.5% jump. In addition, it continued to show momentum in new clients. It added 66 clients during the June 2013 quarter. 

 But, any major increase in the stock valuation from the current levels looks limited. This is because the company still faces pressure on its growth and margin, which is reflected from its stance of not revising the dollar denominated revenue guidance of 6-10% growth for the fiscal. 

 Also, it will be challenging to retain the strong volume growth amidst clouded outlook for IT demand. The management has iterated about the slowing offtake in the high-end, high-margin, discretionary projects. A rerating of the stock would require the company to show a sustained growth scenario in the coming quarters."

Vinay Khattar: Precisely for the same reason, my personal view is not very strong on either side. We were pretty early movers in terms of pricing power getting diluted quite a few years ago and we believe that the stocks would be in pain. Over the last one or two years you have seen certain degree of consolidation happening and beginning to happen and you are seeing certain elements of pricing power especially on the domestic side coming back. But is it early days on that my personal sense is yes you were want to wait a while and see how the trend actually plays out in terms of pricing power and we must not forget that the electronic space, the entire segment of more computerisation, more electronic space is pretty commoditise at this particular point in time and with new players like Reliance Geo entering the space you do not know how the even the data part is going to play out going forward. As far as Africa is concerned that remains a very big question mark. Lot of us who have been bullish on the Africa story at an earlier point in time have really not got it right and that remains a question mark.

  What is your thought on the entire banking pack and more importantly the midcap PSU lot? Do you think the valuations justify the stock price movement?
   
  The banking sector run up has been fairly fast over the last 3-4 months and from that perspective, I am not so comfortable with the banking sector. Bbut since I am more bearish on the global cyclicals and since at this point in time and I am more positively inclined towards the domestic plays, I would still stick to the banks at this point as a neutral weight in my portfolio. 
  
  Within that space, I would say a large part of my weightage would go to the large banks because right now I am cautious on the market. I would want to stay in liquid large cap names but since you mentioned midcap banks, I would want to look at two spaces within the midcap banking area. One are those banks which required capitalisation from the government and some of them have got it - IDBI Bank. There are others who may probably be getting into the next few months or quarters. I think these are plays which could see some serious price to book multiple expansion. That is one area to look at. The other is the oil private sector banks which could be place on domestic consolidation. 
  
  So these are two areas which are long term - 1-2 years plays rather than next quarter plays. That is the way I would look at it."
Ashok Leyland raises Rs 667 crore through QIP,"{""Ashok Leyland"": ""positive""}",https://m.economictimes.com/ashok-leyland-raises-rs-667-crore-through-qip/articleshow/38078400.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ashok Leyland raises Rs 667 crore through QIP,"NEW DELHI: Hinduja Group flagship company Ashok Leyland has raised Rs 667 crore via qualified institutional placement (QIP), a move that would help the company improve its financial position. 

 The capital raising comes on the back of a strong operating margin performance in Q4 - reflecting cost reduction and margin improvement measures, as well as the expectation of a turnaround in the domestic commercial vehicle market, Ashok Leyland said in a statement. 

 The QIP, launched on June 26, attracted a very favourable response from institutional investors across geographies, it added. 

 ""The issue was subscribed by foreign institutional investors, mutual funds and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) amongst others. The issuance will help improve the debt and the financial position of Ashok Leyland,"" Ashok Leyland Chief Financial Officer Gopal Mahadevan said. 

 The Chennai-based firm allotted 1,852 lakh shares to eligible qualified institutional buyers at an issue price of Rs 36 per share (face value of Re 1 and a premium of Rs 35 per equity share), a premium of 5 per cent to the SEBI floor price, aggregating around Rs 667 crore. 

 Ashok Leyland shares were trading at Rs 33.05 apiece on the BSE, down 6.11 per cent from its previous close."
"At Wipro, growth remains a mirage","{""Wipro"": ""negative""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/at-wipro-growth-remains-a-mirage/articleshow/19629040.cms,m.economictimes.com,"At Wipro, growth remains a mirage","BANGALORE: Wipro, the last among India’s large information technology services companies to report March quarter earnings, posted the weakest sales-growth among peers, and gave a poor near-term outlook that could see its sales shrinking marginally in the June quarter.

The company’s management blamed the stagnating sales on discretionary spend not returning and lower exposure in the banking and financial services industry compared with peers.

“In the first month of the quarter, we expected discretionary spend to start coming in, but that did not happen till the end,” said TK Kurien chief executive officer. “That resulted in a large part of our miss in the banking and financial services vertical.”

Kurien added that unfavourable cross-currency movements also hurt sales numbers during the quarter. Wipro’s performance dashed investor hopes of a return to growth for the company, which has been lagging the industry for over a year now. In the just-completed financial year, the company saw sales expanding 5% as against industry growth pace of a little over 10%.

In the March quarter, sales reported in dollars grew 0.5% sequentially, compared with 1.4% for Infosys and a little over 3% for HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services. This was the second worst quarter for the company in the just-concluded financial year, the other being first quarter when revenues fell 1.4%.

Ever since chief executive officer TK Kurien took over in early 2011 after the co-CEO model was dismantled, it has been a story of waiting for investors. The latest financial performance not only fails to give proof of growth taking firm roots, but also signals that it may take much longer for the company to start matching its peers.

“The management has made several changes to the structure to align it more with the demand generation process and increasing efficiency,” said Dipen Shah of Kotak Securities. “We believe that, these initiatives have not yet started showing the expected results and will start reflecting in the financials in due course of time.”

	 


Kurien’s previous commentary over the quarters about putting together a crack team of “hunters” to get multi-hundred million-dollar technology contracts remains a work-in-progress as sales numbers do not seem to show proof of the efforts bearing fruit yet. Client additions, however, continued at reasonable pace with 52 new clients being added in the latest quarter.

While it may not negate the emerging consensus on demand revival in the industry, Wipro’s outlook, taken together with that of Infosys, does question the pace of recovery.

Combined with IBM missing estimates yesterday, Wipro’s dismal outlook does put a question mark on overall technology spending and the nature of technology spending in the current financial year.

The robust numbers coming from HCL Technologies and TCS, and the poor performance from Infosys and Wipro also raises the question about capabilities that different companies have to capture the nature of emerging demand, where newer technology areas such as cloud, mobility and analytics are gaining prominence.

The silver lining in the company’s performance during the March quarter was the jump in consulting revenues, which may signal early-stage projects, where revenue could start kicking in within one to two quarters. But the fall in revenue from Europe is worrisome, especially after the company won one large deal there recently."

India's largest online travel agency had earlier proposed to sell 4.5 million shares, which also includes stake sales by its existing shareholders. 

 The offering will see the company raise $65.9 million, after deducting the issue related expenses. The remaining amount will go to shareholders including management and the company's venture capital investors SAIF Partners and Sierra Ventures, who will sell a portion of their holding. 

 Makemytrip said in an SEC filing that it plans to sell the shares for $23 per unit and close the issue by March 19. The company's shares closed at $23.59, up by 0.38% on Friday, 14 March.

 In addition to the venture capital investors, the company's chief executive officer Deep Kalra, chief commercial officer Keyur Joshi and head of Indian operations Rajesh Magow are also selling a portion of their holding. Subsequently, the shareholding of the management is expected to come down from the present level of 12.34% to 10.27%. 

 SAIF Partners is looking to sell 1 million shares and also has the option to sell an additional 825,000 shares. The firm which is the largest shareholder in Makemytrip, will see its holding reduce to 26.2%. Sierra Venture's stake will come down from 3.99% to 1.23% after the offering. 

 Other major shareholders like Tiger Global, T Rowe Price and Wasatch Advisors are not selling any shares in this offering. 

 Citigroup, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank Securities are acting as joint book running managers to the offering. 

 Makemytrip said that it will use the funds to acquire strategic businesses and invest in its technology. The company has made a string of relatively small sized acquisitions. In February, Makemytrip acquired Amsterdam-based Easytobook, which provides online hotel bookings in Europe and North America, for $5 million. In 2012, it acquired two Thailand-based companies, including the Hotel Travel Group for $25 million and in 2011, it bought Singapore-based Luxury Tours & Travels besides picking up minority stakes in two India-based startups MyGuestHouse Accommodations and Ixigo. 

 For the nine-month period ending December 2013, MakeMyTrip reported a 12% increase in total revenues to $194.5 million with net loss widening to $18 million from the year-ago period."

Popularising G-Secs among retail investors,"{""G-Secs"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/popularising-g-secs-among-retail-investors/articleshow/34401337.cms,m.economictimes.com,Popularising G-Secs among retail investors,"By: P S Reddy

The budget lays out the government borrowing programme in a financial year. But hardly anyone knows the process of borrowing and where the money comes from. World over it is an institutional market with players like banks, pension funds, insurance companies and MFs who participate both in primary and secondary markets. The RBI Working Group Report on enhancing liquidity in government securities devoted a chapter on ‘Retail Participation in G-sec Market’ but has not suggested solutions beyond the existing G-Sec functional framework.


	To begin with, poor retail participation is due to poor awareness. The existing infrastructure for G-Secs including participants such as bank treasury departments and primary dealers, are concentrated in Mumbai. Second, liquidity in the secondary market in G-Sec is conspicuous by its absence. The trading platforms of BSE and NSE for G-Secs have reported nil volume mostly due to poor retail holding. Third hurdle is the complex procedures to transfer securities from a SGL account to demat and vice-versa. Even between depositories interoperability for G-Secs is not permitted.


	The first step in this direction is to issue tax-free bonds which are hitherto issued by PSUs such as REC, PFC and NTPC as government bonds through the branch network of banks, and pass on the proceeds to PSUs. It will increase the liability of GoI. The liability does not stick to the government as the principle and the interest will be serviced by respective PSUs.


	As the banks get commission for distributing these bonds, they will be glad to sell to their customers. In the year 2012-13, Rs 18,000 crore bonds were issued, of which Rs 14,700 crore is through the public issue. In 2013-14, permission to issue tax-free bonds worth Rs 53,000 crore was received of which only Rs  32,000 crore was raised till December, 2013. 
	
	 

	 


	Every year in the Finance Act, the government can make a provision for issuing tax-free bonds on behalf of PSUs. But the government/RBI must issue bonds when the PSU wants them without getting stuck in bureaucracy. The cost of the issue will be borne by the PSU. The difference is that it will be called Government of India Bond and it will be sold through the branch network.


	This process will popularises  G-Secs amongst the public at no additional cost to the government. Although there are ninety-plus G-Secs outstanding, the most active ones are the top five securities with a tenure of ten years which accounts for 80-90per cent of the total G-Sec turnover. About 55per cent of the outstanding G-Secs are held by banks as a part of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) for mandatory compliance irrespective of the return on the securities.


	While RBI concurs that the SLR is required to be reduced over a period for optimum utilisation of resources it is better if a return-reward scheme is devised for availing lower SLR by the banks. RBI may permit banks to sell a part of their SLR securities holding (say 5per cent) to retail investors through their branch network with an offer to buy back from the customers any time during the bond tenure.


	Banks have to display in their branches bid and ask prices on a daily basis much the same way the FD rates are displayed. With this policy framework in place, commercial banks which desire to earn higher returns than what the G-Secs are offering will undertake marketing of G-Secs to its customers.

	 The scheduled commercial banks together hold `20 lakh crore G-Sec as at the end of March, 2013. If RBI permits even a 5per cent of the outstanding amount for offloading to retail investors, it will be `1 lakh crore. To monitor the distribution of G-Secs banks have to open a demat pool account of G-Secs and transfer G-Secs to the demat accounts of customers as and when the transaction takes place. The depositories can furnish MIS to RBI about the SLR securities divested to retail investors.


	The depository for G-Secs is run by RBI which maintains records at ‘nominee’ level as against ‘beneficial owner’ level maintained in CDSL/NSDL. As a result, the RBI will have only the aggregate number of securities of each participant such as a bank or a primary dealer who in turn will have the record of the individual beneficiary owner.


	The depositories have respective CSGL accounts with RBI and the transfer between one beneficial owner in one depository to another beneficial owner in another depository cannot happen without change in CSGL accounts maintained with RBI. As many investors in the secondary market experienced superior infrastructure with a transparent accounting process, they are not able to accept the transfer mechanism in existence for G-Secs. RBI may discard the SGL/CSGL system and ask the banks to hold and transact in G-Secs through CDSL/NSDL. With these three measures which are all doable, the RBI must give it a try.

Strong deals crucial for Wipro's growth push,"{""Wipro"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/wipro-sales-engine-is-getting-stronger-every-quarter-thierry-delaporte/articleshow/93019340.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Wipro sales engine is getting stronger every quarter: Thierry Delaporte,HOLAXD
Ten key takeaways from Wipro Q1 results,"{""Wipro"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/ten-key-takeaways-from-wipro-q1-results/articleshow/48195746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ten key takeaways from Wipro Q1 results,"BENGALURU: Here are 10 takeaways from the first quarter results of Wipro: 

 
Revenue: Wipro barely managed to meet its own revenue guidance, posting a 1.1% sequential increase in revenues. CEO TK Kurien conceded that the performance was disappointing and said that the results were “not great,” blaming the underperformance on a tough quarter from its energy vertical that took out $200 million from its top-line this quarter. The weak Q1 numbers will now make it nearly impossible for Wipro to post double-digit year-on-year revenue growth this year. 

 
Guidance: Wipro’s guidance of 1.5-3.5% sequential growth in revenue for Q2 indicates a much improved performance ahead, but it still won’t be good enough to make up for the deficit from Q1. The road to consistently strong revenue growth for Wipro looks like a tough one for now and will put even more pressure on Kurien, given that Wipro recently created a COO position to free him up from daily operations and focus only on future strategy and vision. 

 
Hikes for top performers: Wipro HR head Saurabh Govil said that top performers across the company have been rewarded with a 10-15% average hike, with one out of every four Wipro employee receiving a double-digit hike. The wage hikes dragged down the margins for this quarter, and Wipro said the impact of wage hikes will be felt in the next quarter too. Wipro also handed out promotions to about 10,000 junior-level employees. 

 
Hiring and utilisation: Wipro ended the quarter with a total headcount of 161,789, with a gross headcount addition of 3572. Around 12,517 sales and support staff left the company during the quarter -- higher than last quarter’s figure of 11,629. Utilisation inched up by 140 basis points to 81.9% from the last quarter. 

 
Client additions:  Wipro added 36 new customers during the quarter, but the number of $100-million customers dropped by one. The company added two clients in its $75-million customer bucket. Overall, the company was hit hard because of the energy vertical, where most of its top customers cut back on spending due to falling oil prices. Wipro, however, said that things had stabilised in the energy vertical and it was well-poised for growth in the near term. 

 
Verticals: As mentioned earlier, energy proved to be a drag during -- other than E&U, even healthcare faced a tough quarter, while telecom continued to decline as well. 

 
Margins: Margins dropped 120 basis points from last quarter to 21%, hurt mainly by the wage hikes and pricing pressure in the traditional outsourcing business. 

 
Investments in startups: Wipro Ventures made two startup investments during the quarter -- artificial intelligence startup Vicarious and early-stage big data startup Talena. San Francisco-based Vicarious is developing the next-generation of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and solutions that aims to digitally replicate the part of the human brain which controls vision, body and language to enable computers achieve human-level intelligence. What's particularly noteworthy though is that the startup is backed by a long list of notable investors that includes Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Vinod Khosla, Ashton Kutcher, Dustin Moskovitz, Aaron Levie, Sam Altman, Formation 8 and Swiss automation giant ABB. It has raised around $70 million funding until now. 

 
Geographies: Europe proved to be the biggest drag during the quarter, registering a decline in revenues by 11% on a year-on-year basis and by 1.9% on a sequential basis. India and Middle East saw a significant pickup with a 20% y-o-y growth, while the Americas clocked an 8.6% growth in sales. 

 
Holmes and Wipro Digital: CEO TK Kurien said Wipro was making considerable progress on both its artificial-intelligence platform Holmes and its digital business. The investment in Vicarious was part of a broader strategy to boost and add to Holmes’s existing capabilities, Kurien told ET. Wipro Digital, which bought a design firm called Designit earlier in July, won important deals from Allied Irish Bank and the Lawn Tennis Association of the UK."

  What is your view on Whirlpool?
   
  Whirlpool was on a very smart parabolic rise 3-4 months back and since then it has been just consolidating in a rising kind of small trading channel. Going ahead, I would expect a breakout on the upside. This breakout level is placed at 335 and it is a similar chart to VIP Industries before it moved from 400 to 600. So if you are an aggressive trader, this is the stock for you possibly with a deeper stop loss closer to 290. 
  
  We would look for a first target of 400 and would not be surprised if that was also to be taken out and possibly the stock heads to around 450-475 with a two or three month kind of horizon."

 The proceeds from the IPO will be utilised to purchase of goods transportation vehicles and repayment of certain borrowings. 

 Brokerages have ??advised investors to ‘Subscribe’ to VRL Logistics IPO. 

 According to IIFL report, at the upper end of Rs195-205 price range, the stock is valued at 14.7x FY16E EPS of Rs 13.9 whereas peers such as Gati and Transport Corporation of India trade in the range of 18x-25x. 

 “We note that apart from plain vanilla surface logistics, these peers also provide niche services like express delivery, ecommerce delivery and supply chain management and therefore trade at higher multiples,” the report said. 

 “Nevertheless, with the improving macroeconomic environment, contribution of freight transportation via road is poised to increase and VRL with its largest fleet size, superior track record, strong brand name, diverse client base, and vast management experience is all set to benefit from the opportunities provide by the sector,” it added."
"IPO after tax row is settled, says Vodafone","{""Vodafone"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/telecom/vodafone-may-not-review-india-ipo-before-ending-tax-row/articleshow/35974768.cms,m.economictimes.com,Vodafone may not review India IPO before ending tax row,"MUMBAI: Vodafone Group is unlikely to take a call on whether or not to proceed with its Indian unit’s initial public offering — a plan that was put on the backburner two years ago — until its tax dispute here is resolved and the impact of the next round of spectrum auction on its local finances becomes clear.


	The UK-based telecom major though is hopeful that the new BJPled government would work towards resolving the dispute over the tax, which has now grown to about Rs 20,000 crore, including penalty and interest.


	Local tax authorities had slapped a principal liability of Rs 8,000 crore on Vodafone over its $11-billion deal in 2007 to buy Hutchison Telecommunications International’s majority stake in Hutchison Essar (now Vodafone India). According to officials, the company should have deducted the tax from its payment to Hutchison and paid to the government. Vodafone challenged the claim saying that no tax was payable since it was a deal between two companies based abroad, a view backed by the Supreme Court in January 2012. The government later that year changed laws to tax such transactions retroactively.


	Informal talks to resolve the dispute fell through earlier this year, and Vodafone has invoked international arbitration to resolve the issue.


	In a recent interview, Vodafone India chief executive Marten Pieters told ET that comments from the new Narendra Modi government have raised hope of a more favourable view on the tax case. ""Modi himself and his BJP colleagues have taken a very clear public stance on how bad retrospective tax is. So, they will have a different look at tax, but does that mean the Vodafone tax case will go away?""


	According to him, ""the big boss (Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao) has said that he wants the tax case to be resolved before we can process the IPO, and from his perspective I can imagine he wants a good feeling on the case.""


	The company shelved the India IPO plan in 2012 after the government decided to retroactively change the tax law, which effectively nullified the Supreme Court ruling. Vodafone’s external affairs director Mathew Kirk last week met finance secretary Arvind Mayaram and revenue secretary Rajiv Takru.


	After the meeting, a finance ministry official said the company was keen on conciliation and settling the tax dispute outside the judicial process. The government has to appoint an arbitrator before June 15 following Vodafone’s arbitration notice. The stability of Vodafone India’s balance sheet ahead of the IPO is another key issue that the company would need to consider before deciding on an initial public offering.


	This February, Vodafone India bidRs 19,600 crore to successfully retain airwaves in the 900 MHz band in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata where its licences were up for renewal, and buy 1800 MHz spectrum in 11 other service areas.


	Pieters said Vodafone will fight fiercely to retain 900 MHz in areas where licences will come up for renewal in the next two years. To continue providing services in these places, it will have to buy airwaves through a government auction. The company is also likely to bid for 900 MHz in some circles where it doesn’t have that band of airwaves, Pieters added.


	""We would love to have 900 MHz everywhere, but reality is there are more takers. We will fight for where we have it because it is painful to change the network,"" he said. According to a Deutsche Bank report, based on the outcome of the latest auction in February, Vodafone will likely require as much asRs 31,400 crore to buy 900 MHz spectrum in the six circles where its licences are set to expire at the end of next year. The big fund outgo could weigh on its IPO process.


	 

	An analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage said while Vodafone India’s IPO has been talked about for over three years, and some bankers have worked on it in the past, the bookbuilding process will have to be initiated from the start.


	The process alone would take three months to a year. ""Vodafone already has reputed external auditors and well-documented financials that get reported on the UK entity, so the time line could be lesser for them than some others,"" this executive said.


	Two years ago, Vodafone started reporting its India numbers in the build up to required public disclosures for the IPO. However, worsening of the tax case and the Indian telecom sector in general has resulted in the company shelving the share-sale plan. The person who was to handle the role of company secretary has been redeployed in another finance roll with no clarity on whether he will be needed in the investor-relations role, said a person in the know."

 The company had received the permission from market regulator Sebi in March 2013 for its proposed Rs 700-crore IPO but did not launch the same due to bad market conditions. 

 ""We are engaged with our advisors and investment bankers. We have appointed Axis Capital among others to advise us on the same. We are planning the IPO this financial year itself,"" Videocon director Saurabh Dhoot told PTI here today. 

 The satellite TV arm of the diversified Videocon group today formally announced the change of its name from Bharat Business Channel to Videocon d2h. 

 Dhoot said the rechristening will not have any impact on the IPO. 

 The company also unveiled its 4K ultra high definition services which it will roll out over next three quarters, he said. 

 The company expects an uptick in the sales of 4K or UHD panels in the festive season and it would be targeting its existing customer base. 

 ""It would begin with important sports events which would be enabled by the 4K feed. So we are well prepared to launch that service for our customers. Then we would have movies and general entertainment,"" he said.

"Amidst commodity boom, vanilla remains plain vanilla","{""vanilla"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/amidst-commodity-boom-vanilla-remains-plain-vanilla/articleshow/6092370.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Amidst commodity boom, vanilla remains plain vanilla","THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In Kerala's commodity-rich high ranges, swanky automobiles compete for attention with palatial homes, thanks to a sustained commodity price boom. It isn't easy to spot a gloomy face, but look a little deeper and there are the vanilla farmers, who seem to be the odd ones out when the whole region is ecstatic.
  
  Their heartbreak is entirely owed to the collapse of the commodity's price. Raw vanilla prices - that had once ruled at unbelievable levels of Rs 3,000-3,500 per kg, making a few growers millionaires overnight and prompting hundreds of others to take to growing the climber - are now ruling at an equally incredulous rate of Rs 40 per kg.
  
  Some blame it on misleading production figures emanating from Madagascar, the leading producer of the spice, while others say that it is the competition from synthetic vanilla that is keeping natural vanilla prices at such rock bottom levels.
  
  Says John P John, CEO of Kottayam-based Tharakan & Co: ""Many commercial users of vanilla, like ice cream makers, use synthetic vanilla, and several of those users who have once enjoyed the price difference, refuse to return to using natural vanilla. The result has been a sustained slide in vanilla prices, despite a fall in production"".
  
  He says production in the just-concluded season for the whole country was estimated at 60 tonnes, as against about 150 tonnes in the previous year. Despite the steep year-on-year fall in production of raw vanilla beans, the price this year was lackluster, fluctuating from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 40 per kg.
  
  The mood is equally subdued in the villages of Karnataka where vanilla plantations once thrived. According to Ravi Bhat, a vanilla farmer in Uttar Kannada district, the export-oriented nature of the commodity, its demand dependency on the US market, and the infections affecting the vanilla plants have all contributed to the decline in vanilla's fortunes.
  
  ""As against some 4,000-5,000 farmers who grew vanilla some six years ago in the Sirsi region, there are only some 500 sticking to the crop. The present prices are unsustainable for the farmers"", says Bhat. Farmers say they are not just competing with leading producers like Madagascar, Indonesia, Mexico, Uganda and Papua New Guinea, but struggling with different plant infections as well.
  
  The mood is summed up by John P John, who says growers may even stop cultivating the crop. ""The way it is going, vanilla cultivation may disappear in India within a few years"", says John. That is, if infections affecting the plant and the inability of farmers to even maintain their farms with the existing price realizations, do not put a natural end to the crop before that."

  Do you think these problems are confined to Bharti alone of late by virtue of the foreign currency debt that they have or you are bearish on the telecom space in general as well?
   
  I would not like to comment on a specific stock, I am not allowed to do it but on the sector, we are neutral. Yes, you have regulatory compulsions in terms of the fresh guidelines, which are yet to be formally announced while there have been some information, which has been published in the media. 
  
  Out of the two incremental information, which has come the 8% license fee I do not think so is a major issue but what is an issue is the charging for the extra spectrum, which could impact especially smaller telecom stocks not necessarily Bharti Airtel, so we would use this as an opportunity to increase or overweight the telecom sector rather than sell at current levels because we have seen such volatility during the 3G auction also. 
  
  There were a lot of comments on the auction bids being irrational and so on and so forth and the telecom sector got beaten down quite a lot after that but since then it has been one of the best performing sectors, so we believe that these are opportunities to overweight this sector from a portfolio perspective rather than selling at current levels or going underweight."

Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuations,"{""small caps"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/several-small-caps-trading-at-eye-popping-valuations/articleshow/45092472.cms,m.economictimes.com,Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuations,"MUMBAI: Late last week, when little-known Tilak Finance made it to the MSCI Small Cap index, it stunned many on Dalal Street. The company’s turnover for the year ended March 31, 2014 was Rs 6.42 crore, while its market capitalisation — value of outstanding shares — was Rs 3,861 crore on Friday. The company’s only asset is the 19.2 lakh shares, worth Rs 86 lakh, it owns in Esaar India (not Essar Group).
 
 The inclusion of Tilak Finance along with a couple of others into the MSCI index has put the spotlight on small-cap stocks — many of which are trading at eye-popping valuations. Market watchers said the abnormal values of these stocks suggest operators are active in many of them.
 
 According to an ET study, the market capitalisation-to-sales ratio of nearly 250 actively-traded small-cap stocks is between 50 and 500 times. M-cap-to-sales ratio — one of the several popular valuation matrices — evaluates a stock’s performance vis-à-vis the company’s actual performance. Broadly, a stock with a marketcap-to-sales ratio of less than one can be considered undervalued. But this ratio varies from sector to sector. For instance, the market cap-to-sales of the IT index is 4.2 times; 5 times for fast-moving consumer goods, 1.6 times for capital goods and 0.6 times for oil and gas.
 
 
  “Almost in all these stocks promoter holding is minimal, which makes it easy for the operators to manipulate their stock prices,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder and CEO of KRIS Research.
 
 After a long hiatus, activity in mid- and small-cap stocks revived in February, sparked by the election euphoria. The heightened activity in this category of shares in the last few months is the lengthiest since 2007. For instance, MC Fincorp (formerly Priti Mercantile) has surged over 331% since January 1. The company with a turnover of Rs 10 crore and net profit of Rs 1.28 crore as on March 31, 2014 is currently valued about Rs 5,000 crore in market cap, which is more than the value of more established companies such as Pfizer, IL&FS Transport, JK Lakshmi Cement or Sobha Developers. CCL International, with a net profit of just Rs 99 lakh, is trading at a market cap of Rs 4,906 crore. The stock found place in the recent revamp of MSCI Smallcap Index.
 
 Several companies like Goldline International, Sulabh Engineers & Services, Pine Animation, Surabhi Chemicals & Investments and Mangalam Industrial Finance, among others, with a sales of few crores and profits of a few lakhs traded with a market cap of over Rs 2,000 crore. Officials at larger brokerages said operators are luring retail investors to buy these stocks by sending text message alerts, Whatsapp messages and emails though it is not as rampant as it was in 2006 and 2007.
 
 While capital market regulator Sebi has strengthened its surveillance in recent years, market watchers believe more could be done in the small-cap space. “The stocks that are trading at unreasonable valuations without any reason warrant an investigation for the price manipulations,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD, InGovern Research Services."

Prasun Kumar Mukherjee quits Sesa Sterlite,"{""Sesa Sterlite"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/prasun-kumar-mukherjee-quits-sesa-sterlite/articleshow/32854326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Prasun Kumar Mukherjee quits Sesa Sterlite,"NEW DELHI: Sesa Sterlite's Executive Director (Iron Ore Business) Prasun Kumar Mukherjee has quit the company, making the first high profile exit from the Vedanta group since its restructuring in August last year. 

 Confirming the news, company officials said Sesa Sterlite Board is scheduled to meet tomorrow for accepting the resignation of Mukherjee, who was the go-to man of Vedanta chief Anil Agarwal in the times of distress. 

 The officials, requesting not to be identified, further said that Mukherjee, who is also a member of the Sesa Sterlite Board, will be demitting office on March 31. 

 Incidently, M S Mehta, CEO of Vedanta Resources Plc and Sesa Sterlite, both, will also be retiring on March 31, making two top level exits from Vedanta group on the same day. 

 Vedanta has already announced appointment of former Rio Tinto boss Tom Albanese as CEO of both the firms from April 1. 

 The sources said that till a successor of Mukherjee, 58, is found, Pramod Unde, currently Chief Operating Officer of the Iron Ore Business, would be heading the business. 

 Mukherjee could not be reached for comments. A company spokesperson did not take calls seeking comments on the matter. 

 Mukherjee is credited with making Sesa Goa India's top private sector iron ore miner by expanding company's operations many folds. Under him, the company saw its peak and possibly its worst period as well. At its peak in 2010-11, Sesa Goa had reported a turnover of Rs 10,152 crore and profit of Rs 4,222 crore. 

 However, imposition of mining bans, first in Karnataka and later in Goa, had a debilitating effect on the company, which is now known as Iron Ore Business of Sesa Sterlite and has led to company reporting a negative EBITDA of 148 crore in the April-December, 2013. 

 Industry sources said that Mukherjee wanted to demit office last year itself but was persuaded to continue as he was leading from the front during the mining ban. While operations in Karnataka has resumed, mining ban in Goa is expected to be lifted soon. 

 A mining industry veteran, Mukherjee has been with Sesa Goa (now Sesa Sterlite) since 1987 and was its Managing Director since April, 2006. He continued as MD of the Goa- based mining firm even after Vedanta group acquired it in 2007 from Japan's Mitsui & Co. 

 Last year in August, when Sesa Sterlite came into existence after merger of Sterlite Industries and some other Vedanta group firms into Sesa Goa, Mukherjee was appointed Executive Director (Iron Ore Business) of the company. 

 His contract with the company is valid till March, 2015. Future moves of Mukherjee are not yet known, though some company officials said that for the time being, he would not be joining any firm and pursue his interests in football and music."

 The capital market regulator has to recover Rs 64.85 lakh from Ranbaxy's former independent director V K Kaul and Rs 12.97 lakh from his wife Bala Kaul. 

 The dues include penalties of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 10 lakh imposed by Sebi on Kaul and his wife in January 2012. 

 In attachment orders dated June 25, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked banks to attach all accounts including lockers held by the couple. 

 Sebi has also directed depositories - NSDL and CDSL - to attach all the demat accounts of the two defaulters. 

 Sebi told the banks and the depositories that there was ""sufficient reason"" to believe that defaulters may dispose of the amounts in the accounts and ""realisation of amount due under the certificate would in consequence be delayed or obstructed"". 

 The regulator has ordered banks and depositories to attach ""all accounts by whatever name called of the defaulter, either singly or jointly with any other persons"". 

 Sebi has also asked banks to attach the lockers held by the entities as well as ""all other amount/proceeds due or may become due to the defaulters or any other money held or may subsequently hold for or on account of defaulter"". 

 It has further ordered the banks and the depositories that no debit would be made in these accounts until further directions. However, the credits, if any, into the account would be allowed. 

 The watchdog has also asked for various details of the accounts held by the entities including account statements. 

 The scrip of Orchid Chemicals saw a huge fall in the last half of March 2008, but then recovered significantly. 

 Several alerts were generated at the NSE and BSE and the scrip was taken up for joint investigation by the exchanges on the basis of which a report was submitted by them in April that year. 

 Bala Kaul had bought several shares of the company on March 27-28, 2008, just prior to the start of share buying by Solrex, a Ranbaxy holding company, on March 31, 2008. 

 It was found that V K Kaul being a connected person of Ranbaxy Laboratories had traded on behalf of his wife in the Orchid Chemical's scrip based on unpublished price sensitive information."
Centralised online system for investor grievances:SEBI,"{""SEBI"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/centralised-online-system-for-investor-grievancessebi/articleshow/7495129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Centralised online system for investor grievances:SEBI,"NEW DELHI: Faced with a herculean task of managing and resolving lakhs of investor complaints, market regulator Sebi is putting in place a web-based centralised system for speedy redressal of these grievances.
  
  Sebi's existing investor grievance redressal mechanism lacks a centralised database and the resolution of the complaints often gets delayed due to physical movement of files from one desk to the another across its various offices.
  
  Besides reducing time gap between receipt and redressal of a complaint, the new system would also help in storage of the investor grievances, whose numbers have swelled to over 2.7 million since Sebi's inception, a senior official said.
  
  Sebi had received more than 32,300 investor complaints in 2009-10, while the numbers are even higher at over 39,600 in the first nine months of the current fiscal.
  
  However, the number of complaints are lower as compared to close to 55,000 in 2007-08 and more than 57,500 in 2008-09.
  
  During 2009-10, total 42,742 grievances were redressed, while more than 38,000 complaints were resolved till December in 2010-11.
  
  The Sebi board, in its meeting last week, took note of the ""herculean task"" of storage, maintenance and retrieval of the records related to investor grievances and deliberated over measures to improvise the system, the official added.
  
  The board, which also comprises nominees from the government, was told that Sebi was in the process of upgrading its investor grievance redressal mechanism by setting up the web-based centralised system.
  
  To be called Sebi Complaints Redress System (SCORES), the new system would have a centralised tracking system for all grievances at various offices and divisions of Sebi.
  
  Currently, the list of investor grievances are maintained at various divisions and regional offices of Sebi.
  
  Complaints are also received in various physical and electronic formats.
  
  The new system would also facilitate lodging of complaints pertaining to any of the regional Sebi offices from anywhere.
  
  All the grievances and Action Taken Reports would be in electronic mode and linked to the central server.
  
  Besides, the investors would be able to access online the status of their complaints, including the action taken, if any, on their grievances.
  
  The official said the new system would reduce grievance process time, as physical movements of the complaints would no more be required."
Sebi considers proposal on cross-currency futures pairs,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-considers-proposal-on-cross-currency-futures-pairs/articleshow/48949882.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi considers proposal on cross-currency futures pairs,"MUMBAI: Punters could soon get to trade in cross-currency futures pairs at a much cheaper cost on local bourses. Capital market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which regulates currency derivatives jointly with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is mulling a proposal by stock exchanges to offer these pairs in addition to dollar- and eurorupee futures they currently offer.
 
 ""We are considering the proposal as we want to introduce new products and are in discussions with the RBI,"" said a regulatory official aware of the development. ""Once the central bank approves it, exchanges could launch cross-currency pairs like dollar-euro, dollar-pound and dollar-yen.""
 
 Currency derivatives were launched first on NSE and the erstwhile MCX Stock Exchange, now MSEI, in 2008. Currently, punters can take a view on how the rupee will move against the dollar, euro, yen and pound on bourses like NSE, BSE and MSEI.
 
 Currency brokers like Suresh Nair, director at Admisi Forex, said, if allowed, the move would reduce one leg of a transaction for traders and reduce transaction costs.
 
 For instance, if one has a view that the dollar would rise against the euro, currently she has to sell the rupee and buy the dollar, or go long dollar-rupee. In the second leg she sells the euro and buys the rupee, effectively making her long dollar and short euro.
 
 If bourses launch new cross-currency pairs, a trader who feels the dollar would rise versus the euro could simply go long dollar and short euro. This will save her brokerage on the extra leg and reduce transaction costs, too.
 
 ""At times it has been observed that the dollar, while not exhibiting much movement against the rupee, moves sharply against the euro or the yen. If one wants to take a future view on the dollar-euro or dollar-yen, they would have to either long/short dollar-rupee and short/long euro-rupee. If indeed the RBI permits new cross-currency pairs for being traded, it will increase interest in currency derivatives and raise the combined turnover of all the exchanges,"" said Harish Galipelli, head of currency at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities.
 
 While regulators approved currency derivatives primarily to offer an alternate and cheaper hedging option, than the OTC market, to small and medium scale industry, brokers say, it has been largely a speculative play, with proprietary trades accounting for almost 60 per cent of turnover.
 
 Jamal Mecklai, CEO of Mecklai Financial, a forex consultancy, attributes this to an SME having to eventually convert its forex inflow or outflow with an authorise dealer (bank), where it might not get as attractive a rate it does for hedging in the futures market. Besides, on the futures market liquidity is restricted to the front and the next month contracts; far month contracts being relatively less traded. ""Cross-currency futures will probably attract more punters than genuine users as the current experience proves,"" added Mecklai.
 
 In the week through Friday, combined currency derivatives turnover of NSE, BSE and MSEI (erstwhile MCX-SX) was Rs 1.22 lakh crore. NSE led with a market share of around 62 per cent, BSE at 32.5 per cent and MSEI the rest."
Sebi plans new norms for municipal bonds,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/sebi-plans-new-norms-for-municipal-bonds/articleshow/37008645.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Sebi plans new norms for municipal bonds,"NEW DELHI: To provide new investment avenues to public and institutional players, market regulator Sebi is working on fresh guidelines for municipal bonds -- a popular financial product in developed countries like the US.
 
 The market for municipal bonds, also known as 'muni bonds', is yet to take off in India even though few municipalities here have offered such products in the past, while Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in Gujarat was the first to launch such a bond way back in 1998.
 
 Muni bonds are very popular among investors in many developed nations, especially the United States, where muni bonds have attracted investments totalling over USD 500 billion and are among preferred avenues for household savings.
 
 These bonds are issued by urban local bodies to finance infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation. They serve as an efficient tool for local bodies to mop up funds and can be extensively tapped to meet funding needs of urbanisation.
 
 While there is already an existing framework for issuance of muni bonds, including by the Ministry of Urban Development, there are no unified norms to bolster this nascent market.
 
 When asked about municipal bonds, Sebi chairman U K Sinha said there is a ""preliminary thinking"" at the capital markets regulator and other authorities would be consulted soon.
 
 ""It will have to be a joint effort of Sebi, Ministry of Finance and of course the concerned state government. Preliminary thinking is there ... may be after a couple of months, especially when some of the programmes from the government are very well known. Everyone are waiting for budget announcements, things will move in that direction,"" Sinha said on the sidelines of an event over the weekend.
 
 The fresh push for muni bonds also comes at a time when the regulators and government are looking at ways to channelise household savings into the market to boost overall economic growth.
 
 India's savings rate stood at little over 30 per cent of the GDP in 2012-13 fiscal while household savings rate was nearly 22 per cent during the same period.
 
 In India, muni bonds were issued for the first time by a municipality in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 Way back in 1998, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had become the first municipality to come out with muni bonds. Since then few others, including Greater Vishakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, had issued such bonds.

Sebis reading of control issue confounds experts,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-reading-of-control-issue-confounds-experts/articleshow/29128499.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi’s reading of ‘control’ issue confounds experts,"MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi’s informal guidance on the issue of control of a company in case of R System International and Bhavook Tripathi has baffled corporate lawyers. 

 In its interpretative letter, Sebi has said that unless the shareholder actually acquires control of the company, he would be considered a public shareholder. A Delhi-based software company R System International has requested Sebi not to classify Bhavook Tripathi, who holds 34.82% in the company, as a public shareholder since by virtue of his holding, Tripathi can influence the company in a significant way. R System pleaded that one of the ways in which Tripathi can exercise such influence is by his ability to block matters requiring shareholders’ nod by way of a special resolution under the Company’s Act 1956. 

 Sebi, while informally terming the acquirer as a non-promoter, seems to have given credence to the fact that there’s still no clarity on the control of the company. “I don’t think Sebi’s informal guidance in case of R System International is correct,” said Huzzefa Nasikwala, founder, Nasikwala Law Chambers. 

 “In India, there’s no yardstick to define promoters in terms of their stake, as persons with as low as 25% can control a company. 

 On the other hand, a person who can influence the company in a significant way with over one-third stake, has been treated as a public shareholder,” he added. In R System, Tripathi made an open offer and his stake rose to 34.82%. While the promoters held 50.17%, thereby leaving the public shareholding at 15%, which is less than the required minimum of 25%. According to the Sebi takeover regulations, the acquirer was required to cut stake to ensure the target company complies with the minimum public holding norm of 25%. But if the acquirer is treated as public shareholder, he is not required to reduce his shareholding in the company. 

 This is somewhat different from the regulator’s stance in other cases such as Subhkam Investments and Clearwater where Sebi had been critical and strict on the issue of ‘control’. The issues raised in the recent informal guidance on R System International signals certain broader trends in the regulatory thought-process, say lawyers. 

 “If the current informal guidance can be seen as Sebi’s relaxation of its past stance, then probably large investors in future should not face Sebi’s stiff resistance while showcasing that merely because of their substantial shareholding, they should not be construed as exercising control over the company and tagged as a promoter,” said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal. While the Sebi informal guidance favours potential acquirers, it leaves some possibilities and many questions open, say corporate lawyers. 

 “It may be possible for a single investor to hold a significant stake and still be treated as part of the public,” said U Umakanth, a corporate law expert. “However, the question as to whether such a large shareholding through which negative control can be exercised by blocking special resolutions would amount to ‘control’ has not been specifically answered, though one can deduce from the result of the informal guidance that Sebi does not believe this to amount to ‘control’."

 Since January this year, 20 companies have filed their draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with Sebi to launch an initial public offer (IPO), while SMC Global Securities Ltd sought Sebi's approval for its follow-on public offer (FPO). 

 Barring Sharda Cropchem and GMR Energy, other 18 firms filed their initial papers after the general election verdict was announced in mid-May. 

 Sharda Cropchem filed its draft document in February and GMR Energy sought Sebi's approval in March. However, GMR Energy withdrew its application in April. 

 Of these firms, Sebi has already given nod to the IPOs of Lavasa Corporation, Adlabs Entertainment, Ortel Communications and MEP Infrastructure Developers. However, these four companies are yet to launch their public offers. 

 Besides, the regulator has sought clarification or additional information from the merchant bankers of some of the companies. 

 Most of the companies plan to utilise IPO proceeds for capacity expansion as well as working capital requirements. 

 Of these 20 firms, only two companies -- Sharda Cropchem and Monte Carlo Fashions -- got listed on the stock exchanges. 

 According to market experts, landslide victory of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the general elections has perked up investor sentiment and prompted companies to file IPO papers. 

 Analysts expect a spurt in IPO market next year because many firms which has received Sebi's approval may launch their public offers in 2015. 

 So far in 2014, the 30-share benchmark Sensex has gained over 28 per cent spurred by robust fund flows and revival of risk appetite amid signs of improving economic conditions."
Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/minimum-shareholding-norm-not-for-non-controlling-entity-sebi/articleshow/28560945.cms,m.economictimes.com,Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,"MUMBAI: A non-promoter entity can't be asked to reduce stake in a listed company if its purchase of shares, without acquiring control of the firm, leads to non-compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 The views have been expressed by market regulator Sebi in an 'interpretive letter' issued to a company, R Systems International, which had sought an 'informal guidance' on this matter in relation to purchase of a significant stake by a non-promoter entity. 

 Sebi noted that the non-promoter entity belonged to the category of public shareholders since ""the prime objective behind the acquisition is the investment value in the equity shares of the target company (R Systems) and not substantial holding of shares/voting rights/control or management of the target company. 

 ""Therefore until and unless the acquirer actually acquires control of the target company, the acquirer would be considered as public."" 

 As per the company submissions, Bhvook Tripathi, a non-promoter entity, had acquired shares of the firm that increased his stake in the company to over 30 per cent and resulted in fall of public shareholding below the 25 per cent prescribed limit. 

 R Systems had sought Sebi's views on whether the share purchase by Tripathi will be treated as part of the non-public holding of the company and if so will the acquirer be required to reduce its stake in the company to ensure compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 As per Sebi rules, an entity is obligated to bring down its shareholding to the level specified for maximum permissible non-public shareholding (75 per cent) within a stipulated time. 

 However, in the case of R Systems, Sebi noted that Tripathi belonged to the category of public shareholder as he was neither a promoter nor a person acting in concert with the promoters and had bought shares for investment purposes and not for acquiring control in the company. 

 Moreover, Sebi said that going by the shareholding pattern of R Systems for quarter ending September 2013, Tripathi was listed as a public shareholder. 

 ""The expression acquirer has been defined as any person who directly or indirectly acquires shares or voting rights in or control over a target company either by himself, or through or with any person acting in concert with him. 

 ""As per the definition the acquirer means any person which is includes both promoter and public,"" Sebi said."

 ""These (clearing corporations) are also subjected, on an on-going basis, to rules and regulations that are consistent with the PFMI issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),"" Sebi said. 

 The international standards were issued in April 2012 and all G-20 nations were to required to adhere to these strict standards to check derivative-related risks in the financial system. 

 These rules were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, settlement, and recording arrangements, and more broadly, to limit systemic risk and foster transparency and financial stability.

Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-mulls-prudential-governance-norms-for-stock-brokers/articleshow/43069625.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,"NEW DELHI: After prescribing a new Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, capital markets watchdog Sebi is now mulling over a new set of Prudential Governance Norms for stock brokers to safeguard investors' interest. 

 The proposed norms, which are currently at draft stage and are going through consultations, would considerably enhance the disclosure requirements by stock brokers and can subject them to tightened regulations with regard to related party transactions and audit of their books and other dealings. 

 Besides, the brokers may also be required to put in place a whistle-blower mechanism and frame an effective 'code of conduct' for their directors and senior management personnel, in line with similar norms for listed companies as prescribed by Sebi and in the new Companies Act, sources said. 

 These norms have been proposed by Sebi to ensure that any adverse impact on the interest on investors as well as on the integrity of securities markets can be avoided in the event of any lapses at the end of stock broker. 

 Sebi is aiming to ""minimise/prevent occurrence of circumstances leading to default in making payments by stock brokers to stock exchanges or clients due to lack of due diligence in their risk management system, due to mis-management leading to instability or failure in operations of stock broker including insolvency etc"" with these norms. 

 The new corporate governance norms for listed companies are coming into effect from October 1. However, Sebi recently relaxed some provisions after representations from the industry bodies and the government and it has given time till April 1, 2015 for a key provision of having minimum one woman director on the boards of listed companies. 

 A senior official said that the brokers have also already begun making representations before the regulator with concerns that any tightening of corporate governance norms could hurt their business due to high compliance costs. 

 The brokers are arguing that they are already operating in a highly regulated business and the new Companies Act has already provided for significant tightening of norms for the corporate brokerage firms. 

 Among others, the proposed norms would require brokers to submit their audited annual reports within 60 days of end of a financial year and a half-yearly networth certificate within two months of the end of a half-year to the stock exchange. 

 The quarterly financial results would be required to be submitted within 45 days of end of each quarter, while annual audit would need to be done by ""an independent, competent and qualified auditor"". 

 No stock broker would be allowed to re-appoint an individual as an auditor for more than one term for five consecutive years. In case of an audit firm, it can be appointed for maximum two terms of five consecutive terms. 

 In their periodic financial disclosures, the brokers would have to separately mention the advance or margins received from their clients, as also any advance or loans given by them. 

 Details of loans, advances or investments in subsidiaries, associates or group companies, as also all material information about their financial position, performance, governance and ownership, would need specific disclosures. 

 The brokers would also need to disclose all exceptional income and expenditure, along with auditors' observations, while their quarterly and annual financial results would need to be approved by the board of director and CEO/CFO along with a certification of ""absence of falsity or omission"". 

 The board of directors would need to lay down a code of conduct for all board members and senior management of the company, and also devise an effective whistle blower mechanism enabling all stakeholders, including employees, to freely communicate their concerns about any illegal or unethical practices. 

 The board would have to ensure that the interest of a whistle-blower is not prejudicially affected. 

 With regard to investor grievance, a compliance officer would need to ensure that they are redressed in a stipulated manner and within a given timeline. The status of all investor complaints would need to be reviewed and analysed every six months and corrective steps would be required to be taken by the compliance officer to ""minimise recurrence in future"". 

 The CEO of the company would need to certify that ""there are no transaction entered into by the stock broker during the year which are fraudulent, illegal or violating the stock broker's code of conduct"". 

 The certification would also include that the auditor has been informed about any significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting or in accounting policies, as also about the ""instances of significant fraud of which they have become aware and the involvement therein, if any, of the management or an employee""."

 Sebi had earlier ordered attachment of bank accounts and demat accounts of -- Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Prem M Parikh, Bharat S Thakkar, Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Hemant Kumar Motihar -- to recover the penalties imposed on them for violation of capital market norms. 

 In separate release orders issued this month, the market watchdog said it has recovered Rs 33.44 lakh from Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Rs 7.1 lakh from Prem M Parikh, Rs 6.46 lakh from Bharat S Thakkar, Rs 4.54 lakh from Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Rs 2.57 lakh from Hemant Kumar Motihar. 

 Together these dues amount to Rs 54.14 lakh. They include interest and other expenses along with the penalties. 

 Stating that it had collected ""full and final settlement of the dues"" from the defaulters, Sebi directed the banks and depositories - NSDL and CDSL - to defreeze the accounts of the entities. 

 ""...you are hereby directed to release the bank accounts/ lockers/demat accounts, of the defaulter attached, if any, pursuant to the notice of attachment,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in the release orders. 

 Till July-end, the market regulator was able to recover penalties worth nearly Rs 7 crore from several defaulters. 

 Sebi had began passing orders earlier this year to defreeze bank accounts and demat accounts of entities which made the payment of outstanding dues. 

 The capital markets watchdog began initiating attachment proceedings against defaulters, including individuals and companies, in October last as per the greater powers granted to it through an ordinance promulgated by the government. 

 Since then, the Sebi has launched nearly 1,400 attachment proceedings for recovery of penalties imposed in as many as 393 cases. These proceedings involve attachment of bank accounts, movable and immovable properties, shares and debentures, among others.

 The proposed study will also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others. 

 The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by capital markets regulator Sebi for the next financial year beginning April 1, 2014, for which it has identified 'capacity building' as a core focus area, a senior official said. 

 According to the proposed move, a comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to understand the ""trend/pattern discovery by regulators in developed markets like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong"" in order to keep pace with the ever increasing globalisation of Indian markets. 

 ""The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc,"" the official added. 

 In 2014-15, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) also plans to organise an International Research Conference with an aim to commence a dialogue on ways to tackle newer challenges faced by securities markets by ameliorating the pool of research talent around the world. 

 Sebi, which was established on April 12, 1988, has also proposed to organise a Foundation Day lecture each year, beginning the next fiscal by inviting a Nobel laureate or an eminent person from the fields like economics and finance to talk on relevant issues for securities markets. 

 With regard to Sebi's capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously. 

 At present, Sebi's average training budget per person per year is the lowest among all its peer regulators, while the area of skill development also needs a further fillip. 

 While Sebi is already working on increasing its staff strength in a gradual manner from about 700 currently, it is looking to achieve quality enhancement of staff through better training and skill enhancement measures, so as to further bolster the supervisory and regulatory capacity of the organisation."

The Securities and Exchange Board of India and the bourses may introduce a new segment called T+ Group, under which margin requirements would be steep and circuit filters would be lower.
 
 At present, stock exchanges try to prevent manipulation by transferring them to the trade-to-trade segment or T Group.. In this segment, traders have to take delivery of the shares they buy, while the daily maximum tradable limit is 5% on either side.
 
 Exchanges shift stocks to the T Group when there is speculation and unusual movement on the back of higher-than-average volumes. These requirements result in a fall in unnatural activity in such shares. The plan to introduce a new segment comes on the heels of reports of manipulation in stock prices during inclusion into or exclusion from the T Group.
 
 The T+ Group would include shares that have been in the T Group for over three months and whose price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is less than 250 and book value is less than 30 times, said a source familiar with the matter. “Exchanges have got complaints that there is still a lot of manipulation despite stocks being shifted to the T Group. So, they felt there is a need for a new group,” said a source in the know.
 
 Under the T+ Group, margin requirement of 500% and 100% will be introduced on sell and buy transactions respectively. Funds and shares wo
uld be released by the clearing corporation of the exchange only after a month, while the circuit filter would be even lesser than 5%. It has also been proposed that at the time of review, the companies having a P/E greater than 50 times or price-to-book greater than 10 times, will be eligible for moving out of T+ Group to T Group.
 
 Earlier this month, bourses moved almost 550 stocks out of the T Group after they were convinced that speculation has receded. The T Group was introduced shortly after the Ketan Parekh scam in 2001 but the detailed norms of how, when and why shares would be put under surveillance were not disclosed until November 2010."

 LONDON: Come Monday, global equity markets will wake up to a new $558 billion magnet pulling cash out of developing nations from Russia to Malaysia. 

 As Saudi Arabia lifts a ban on direct investments by foreigners, fund allocators are preparing to shift money out of other countries and put it to work in the Arab world's largest stock market. While there's little consensus on which country will be the biggest loser, money managers mostly agree that energy producers will feel the heaviest effects. Below are the views of seven emerging-markets investors and strategists on what to expect: 

 Martial Godet, head of emergingmarket equities and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas SA in Paris: 

 Saudi Arabia “will not be a bargain, but it can be a nice diversification from emerging Asia that has become increasingly large within emerging markets. The biggest losers will be markets associated with oil and energy: Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia.“ 

 Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging-markets strategist at NN Investment Partners in The Hague: 

 “Investors will eventually sell a bit across the board to get to a decent weight in Saudi Arabia. There might be a bit more selling in other oil countries, but then we should ask ourselves what are the pure oil plays in emerging-markets, comparable to Saudi Arabia? Only Russia comes close.“ 

 Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital in London: 

 “The UAE and Qatar may suffer. After Saudi Arabia's inclusion in MSCI EM, investors might think: why bother looking at small Qatar when you can choose Saudi to be your Gulf proxy?“ 

 James Bannan, who oversees the $150 million Frontier Markets Fund at Coeli Asset Management in Mal mo, Sweden: 

 “Most of the large frontier-market funds already have decent exposure to Saudi Arabia. If they were to increase their exposure, it would come from allocations in the region, namely Kuwait, the UAE., Qatar and Oman.“ 

 Rami Sidani, the head of frontier markets at Schroder Investment Management in Dubai: 

 “The event of Saudi Arabia opening up is a very positive development for the entire Gulf region, as it graduates to becoming an investment destination for emerging-market funds. The Gulf market won't be able to be disregarded by international investors as an asset class.“ 

 Julian Mayo, co-chief investment officer at Charlemagne Capital in London: 

 “This move will gradually benefit Saudi in the next two years, as Saudi becomes investible to a wider range of investors, but we don't expect any specific market to suffer as a result of this move. Ultimately, stock performance depends on fundamentals of earnings and valuations.“ 

 Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, the head of the Europe, Middle East, Africa and global frontier markets equity team at Baring Investment Services in London: 

 “I don't think there is going to be a massive knock-on effect to start with from the day of the opening, as the market is being opened in a very limited way with a lot of requirements for anyone wanting to go into the market directly. We are already in Saudi Arabia. It's an out-ofindex position in my fund, which is around 20 %."""

  ""Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) informs that S K Roongta ceases to be the chairman of SAIL with effect from May 31, 2010, on attaining the age of superannuation,"" the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  ""Further, the company informs that Soiles Bhattacharya Director (Finance) SAIL has been given the additional charge of Chairman SAIL,"" it added.
  
  Bhattacharya is the senior most director in SAIL. Official sources said that he has been given the additional charge for a period of three months or until further orders are issued.
  
  The steel ministry had to appoint an interim chairman, as there were delays in approval of state-owned BHEL's C S Verma for the top job in the steel PSU. Government's headhunter Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Verma for the post of chairman of SAIL.
  
  While most of the clearances for Verma were in place, his appointment was not yet confirmed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), pending which Bhattacharya has been appointed as the interim chairman.
  
  A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said that recently certain clarifications were sought from the ACC over appointment of a new chairman of SAIL.
  
  ""The Steel Ministry has already sent its reply on Verma's appointment to the ACC,"" he added.
  
  Steel minister Virbhadra Singh had last month said that he has already approved Verma's name for the post of SAIL chairman and recommended the same to the ACC.
  
  Bhattacharya assumes the responsibility of the country's largest steel firm at a time, which analysts say could be ""a very difficult time for the steel industry"", which is hit by rising prices of raw material like iron ore and coking coal and slackening demand ahead of the monsoon."

Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,"{""Rupee"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-swings-hand-arbitrage-advantage-to-day-traders/articleshow/45635008.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,"MUMBAI: With the rupee turning volatile against the dollar, day traders have tapped an arbitrage opportunity within a short span between the exchange traded futures and domestic over-the-counter forward markets. 

 The intensity on Tuesday was about 5-10 paise compared with zero to three paise a week or two ago in the 1-month contract category. Traders were seen buying the January contract in the dollar-rupee pair at about 63.82/$ while selling the similar maturity forward contract at 63.87-63.88. The gap, or spread, was on the higher end in other pairs like euro-rupee or pound-rupee or yen-rupee. 

 “Traders have initiated fresh long positions for the last two weeks as the rupee has turned volatile,” said Sajal Gupta - head (forex and interest rate), Edelweiss Financial Services. 

 “Earlier, they were enjoying premium of a stable exchange rate. Intra-day sharp volatility led to some arbitrage opportunities.” The average daily futures volume has nearly doubled to 11,300 crore compared with 6,050 crore in the first fortnight of the month, show data from NSE. 

 Between December 15 and 23, the rupee has swung from 62.46 to 63.89 per dollar, a movement as high as 2.29%, or 143 paise. 

 “After being ranged and quiet for nearly five months, dollar/rupee sprang to life since the first week of December,” said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities. “Since then, turnover or participation has increased in all the three pillars of financial markets, viz., speculators, arbitrageurs and hedgers have become active.” 

 Over the past one week, the offshore non-deliverable forward market has been tepid as most traders have gone on leave ahead of year-end festivities globally. 

 The spreads, or gaps, with non-deliverable forward (NDF) from two domestic markets have shrunk to near zero from eight or 10 paise discount earlier. This, too, has fuelled arbitrages between domestic futures and forwards. Futures, forwards and NDFs all are the rupee derivatives. 

 Such large arbitrage opportunities have been lapped up by traders, which has helped in pumping up the volume on the exchange, dealers said. “We have seen arbitrage between futures and forward markets whenever there is demand-supply mismatch and sudden exchange rate volatility,” said Abhishek Goenka, founder & CEO, India Forex Advisors. 

 Arbitrage opportunities wane as and when the exchange rate turns to a particular trending, be it down or up instead of sharp swings. Traders’ rush to tap such opportunities is also being blamed. 

 “That too has not lasted long, as players have captured the difference and consequently, the contracts on OTC and exchange are now almost back at parity,” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, the local unit trended down against the greenback to close the day’s trading at 63.52 per dollar, weakened 0.38% from a day earlier. 

 Oil companies were seen buying dollars in the domestic forwards to meet their month-end demand."

 Goenka, who announced RP Goenka scholarship scheme on Friday, said the group has a net profit of around Rs 900 crore. As per the new rule 2 per cent of the net profit should go to CSR activities. ""Our target is to set up one world class institution in every three years,"" he added. RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group could have an yearly corpus of Rs 18 crore for CSR. ""We want to create institutions and do something which is worthwhile instead of fettering it away.

AGM can open new chapter for RIL shareholders,"{""RIL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/agm-can-open-new-chapter-for-ril-shareholders/articleshow/6061579.cms,m.economictimes.com,AGM can open new chapter for RIL shareholders,"MUMBAI: When Mukesh Ambani steps out of his Black Mercedes, with wife Nita Ambani in tow, on Friday, to chair the annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries (RIL), it could mark the beginning of a new chapter not only for the Ambani family, but the extended family of 3.5 million RIL shareholders.
  
  Many thoughts would cross Mukesh's mind before he proceeds for the 36th AGM, being held at the Birla Matoshree auditorium in south Mumbai, as the company embarks on a new journey of going beyond its traditional business of oil refining to enter new sectors like power, telecom and financial services. These were the very sectors which RIL was barred from entering after the Reliance empire was split between the two brothers . Now, with the truce in place, the AGM would put an official seal on the patch-up , something which shareholders having been hoping to witness for a long time.
  
  What began as a bitter period of animosity between the Ambani brothers five years ago, could well come to an end on Friday, if Anil Ambani attends, something which no one is confirming but everyone is talking about. Anil is expected to represent himself as an ‘ordinary shareholder' , this time to express his gratitude for the truce agreement between RIL and his group.
  
  
  Shareholders expect big announcements
  
  The AGM of RIL would mark a breakaway from what shareholders saw at the August 2005 AGM, when an emotional Anil Ambani had said: ‘‘ Today, it is a very emotional day for me as I stand here with the blessings of my beloved mother Kokilaben . She has given birth to me twice. First, on June 4, 1959 and the second one on June 18, 2005. Both Mukesh and I could not be in front of you without her support and blessings.” Perhaps, June 18, 2010 would mark another rebirth for Anil.
  
  Ironically, he had sought his elder brother's blessings even then, when he was getting started on building his own empire. In all probability , this year's AGM could be like a ‘home coming' for Anil and his family, given the thaw in relations between the two factions.Shareholders could indeed witness a special ‘Kodak ’ moment if the two families happen to be seated together in the front row, just like old times.
  
  However, one sticky subject which Mukesh could touch upon at the AGM is the gas pricing issue for ADAG's power business. Mukesh had, in past AGMs, briefed shareholders on the gas dispute, which has been the main bone of contention between the two brothers ever since the Reliance empire was split. Said Shailesh Mehta, an RIL shareholder , who owns 32 shares of the company since it went public in 1977, ‘‘ I’m expecting the chairman to make big announcements at the AGM. We expect a new vision for RIL.”
  
  Clearly, the mood is already upbeat as to what Mukesh would unveil at the AGM."
Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,"{""richly valued stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/should-you-opt-for-richly-valued-stocks/articleshow/44867043.cms,m.economictimes.com,Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,"The holy grail of stock market investing has forever remained elusive: fundamentally sound companies trading at cheap valuations. Like all good things in life, the top performers of the equity universe—companies that boast stable cash flows, high profit margins and efficient management, among others—carry the burden of high valuations, with their shares trading at substantial premiums to the broader indices as well as their peers.

This presents a dilemma for investors and experts alike. Some people like Vikas Gupta, executive vice-president, Arthveda Fund Management, questions the obsession with 'quality'. ""People are paying through their nose for these stocks. There is no doubt about the solid fundamentals of these companies, but there is a limit to the premium one should be paying for them,"" he says. Gupta believes such valuations cannot be sustained for long. ""There are other companies that are valued at much lower prices, and when these sectors and companies start showing results, money will be pulled out from the highperforming set of stocks,"" he argues.

Therefore, Gupta cautions investors against blindly buying the so-called highquality stocks. ""Unless there is a strong likelihood of the company's sales doubling within the next 2-3 years, and this positive development has not been factored in in the pricing of the stock, paying such a high price for it just does not make sense,"" Gupta adds.

In spite of the warnings by experts, there is always a good reason to track these fundamentally strong companies that have been commanding rich valuations in the market across time periods because of the opportunities they might throw up. Here, we have restricted our search to the CNX100 universe and included only those high-performing stocks that have been around for the past 10 years (since October 2004). The stock-picking filters left us with 79 stocks. Next, we compared the monthly average price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for each of these stocks against the monthly average PE of the Nifty index for the period under consideration. This exercise revealed the number of occasions on which each stock traded at a premium to the benchmark index, helping us identify the final list of perennially expensive stocks.

We have also compared the 10-year median PE of these stocks with the current PE to check where they stand today in terms of historical valuations. To determine the median, we first sort the list in ascending order, then pick the middle value. Comparing it to the average or mean valuation, the median value is a much more realistic interpretation of the market, especially if the data distribution is asymmetrical, which is the case for many of the stocks under consideration. Let's dig deeper into the final list of eight high-performing stocks and assess where they stand in terms of their fundamentals.

Stocks that have consistently traded at premium valuations

				

Asian Paints

The market leader in the paints business has always commanded a hefty premium in the stock market. Its superior pricing power due to its leadership position has allowed the company to maintain healthy profit margins throughout the past decade.

Over the past 2-3 years, Asian Paints has clocked a steady volume growth of around 10 per cent. With the company's new premium offerings in the fast-growing exterior paints segment, it is likely to maintain its profitability. Currently, the stock is trading at around 50 times the trailing 12-month earnings, compared to the 10-year median PE of 31.5. It is available at 144 per cent premium to the Nifty index PE. With these high valuations, most analysts are emphasising on caution despite the company's superior fundamentals. Says Shirish Pardeshi, head, research, Anand Rathi Securities: ""Though the company continues to report a healthy earnings growth, we believe most of the upside is capped at current valuations.""


	 


Dabur

The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major, Dabur, enjoys a strong presence in the low-penetration and high-growth categories. It is known for its unique positioning, with a suite comprising products derived from ayurvedic and herbal sources. The company's robust fundamentals have naturally been awarded with premium valuations at all times. The stock has historically traded at a PE of around 37 times, but is currently enjoying a valuation multiple of nearly 57 times the trailing 12-month earnings. This stands at a 173 per cent premium to the Nifty index, almost twice its historical premium of 88 per cent. Despite these high valuations, analysts remain bullish on the stock given the company's strong innovation pipeline and high volume growth. Says Abneesh Roy, analyst at Edelweiss Securities: ""The company is in a sweet spot with volume growth ahead of most peers due to its huge innovation funnel, higher ad spends and aggressive distribution drive.""

HDFC

The first specialised housing finance company in the country, HDFC has enjoyed premium valuations over the years due to its consistent track record in earnings and loan book growth. Across economic cycles, its return ratios have remained healthy, with a return on equity of over 20 per cent in the past 10 years. The company's share price has appreciated recently due to the expectations of a merger with its subsidiary, HDFC Bank. Today, the stock trades at 29 times the earnings, which is not too far from its 10-year median PE of around 27. Its premium over the Nifty is at par with its historical valuation premium.

""At the operating level, HDFC continues to deliver superior performance led by strong growth, steady margins and robust asset quality. However, the stock is trading at a premium valuation and the scope for upside is limited,"" says a report from brokerage firm, Sharekhan. It maintains its 'hold' rating on the stock.

HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank has always held sway over the market, enjoying rich valuations. It has been awarded for its consistent track record of clocking over 30 per cent profit growth. However, it has recently seen the valuations fall from a historical context, after failing to match its own lofty standards of earnings growth. The valuation premium over the Nifty index has narrowed significantly compared to its historical premium. Analysts, however, remain positive on the stock. Says Vaibhav Agrawal, vicepresident, research, Angel Broking:

""Though the current earnings trajectory at over 21 per cent year-on-year is lower than its illustrious track record of over 30 per cent earnings growth, it is still impressive and better than other large private peers in light of the current macro environment. A likely economic recovery would reflect in higher loan growth, which, in our view, justifies a premium valuation multiple.""

Kotak Mahindra Bank

This relative newcomer in the banking space has made a mark for itself with its focus on retail loans. It fetches the highest net interest margins in the industry at 4.5 per cent and boasts a better-than-average asset quality, with its net non-performing assets (NPA) of 1 per cent. It grew its loan book at 25 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past five years. Its high loan book growth, strong management and consistently high return ratios have allowed it to enjoy rich valuations.

At 51 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is trading marginally higher than its his torical multiple and is expensive. Analysts, however, remain bullish because of its all-round superiority. Says Manish Ostwal, analyst, KR Choksey Institutional Research: ""We believe that strong core capitalisation, superior margins and asset quality, improving liability franchise with strong market positioning in capitallinked businesses, are the key differentiators for Kotak.""


	 


Titan Company

Jewellery and watchmaker, Titan, is another company that has always been valued on the higher side. Its dominant position in the organised market, aided by unwavering trust from an upwardly mobile and increasingly brand-conscious Indian middle class, has held the company in good stead all these years. The stock has historically traded at twice the valuation of the broader Nifty index, but is currently trading at a premium of 135 per cent. At a PE of 49 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is much more expensive than its 10-year median PE of around 39. Yet, analysts are convinced that the stock has enough potential even at these levels. Says Gautam Duggad, analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities: ""We believe that Titan will be a key beneficiary of the improving macro and urban consumer sentiment. The dominant presence in its core segments, underlying shift towards branded segments in both jewellery and watches, and a strong balance sheet make it a compelling play on rising urban aspirations and, therefore, a preference for branded lifestyle goods.""

Apollo Hospitals 

Apollo is India's largest private healthcare service provider, with an integrated business model that offers an umbrella of services. Apart from hospitals, the company has the largest organised pharmacy retail chain, with around 1,600 stores, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of its total revenue. The healthcare services segment has grown at a healthy CAGR of 17 per cent over the past five years on account of incremental hospital addition, as well as expansion and maturity of older hospitals. The pharmacy business has grown at nearly 33 per cent CAGR in the past five years and is also a candidate for possible value unlocking in the future. The consistent growth has allowed the company to fetch premium valuations at all times. At a trailing PE of 46 times, the stock is trading much higher than its historical valuation of around 34.5 times. Analysts say the stock is not providing much comfort at these levels.

Motherson Sumi Systems

This auto component maker has been on an unmatched growth trajectory over the past decade. Even during the troubled years, when its peers struggled, Motherson was able to protect its revenue base and maintain profitability. In the past, it has set very ambitious five-year growth targets for itself and has gone ahead to achieve them.

Having already achieved its revenue target one year in advance, it appears set to meet its target of 40 per cent return on capital employed (ROCE) by 2015. Given such robust fundamentals, analysts continue to back the stock despite a steep PE multiple of 62 times. Says Kaushal Maroo, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services: ""Over the past five years, the Street's focus on nearterm earnings has possibly lead to it missing the bigger picture. The company has emerged from being an Indian wiring harness maker of repute to being a supplier of rear-view mirrors and polymer products to major European original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We see over 30 per cent earnings CAGR during 2013-18.""
The Nifty Fifty era

The craze over high-quality growth stocks has echoes of a bygone era—the US of the 1960s and 70s—when the Nifty Fifty, a basket of 50 popular stocks, enjoyed an obsessive following by investors. These were widely perceived as solid buy-and-hold growth stocks and their lofty valuations were considered well-justified. While these 50 stocks propelled the US bull market of the early 1970s, the subsequent bear market that lasted till 1982 caused valuations of the Nifty Fifty to fall to low levels along with the rest of the market. Most of these stocks underperformed the broader market averages. While many of these are still good performers (Coca-Cola, Gillette, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble), some have lost their way (Polaroid, Eastman Kodak, Dow Chemical). It should serve as a cautionary tale of unrealistic expectations from growth stocks."
Wilmar deal: Not much for Renuka investors,"{""Renuka"": ""neutral"", ""Wilmar"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/wilmar-deal-not-much-for-renuka-investors/articleshow/30757675.cms,m.economictimes.com,Wilmar deal: Not much for Renuka investors,"The proposed deal between Shree Renuka Sugars and Wilmar is certain to disappoint investors, as the stake sale will be at a 10% discount to the current market price. Besides, it will only partially address the company's debt problems.
 
 The Renuka Sugar stock had gained 13.6% in the past four days to Rs 22.5 in anticipation of this deal. Even the proposed open offer price at Rs 21.89 is at a 2.7% discount to the current market price (CMP).
 
 The two-stage deal is expected to help raise Rs 1,240 crore, while the company’s consolidated debt is over Rs 8,700 crore.
 
 “The Brazilian debt is serviced by the Brazilian companies and secured against the assets of those companies. The parent company hasn't given any guarantees towards those loans,” Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugar told ET. The proposed equity infusion will reduce the debt-equity of the standalone parent company from 2.6 to 1, he said.
 
 The two Brazilian subsidiaries jointly have loans close to Rs 5,000 crore. Given this backdrop, the problems related to the company’s stretched balance sheet and huge interest costs may not be addressed swiftly.
 
 The company had reported an operating profit of Rs 1,265 crore for FY13 on a consolidated basis, of which Rs 868 crore went towards servicing its interest payment.
 
 High sugar cane prices and surplus production have resulted in operating losses in Renuka Sugar’s domestic business.
 
 Given the surplus production expected this season, sugar prices are expected to remain flat this year in India. While in spite of a drought in Brazil, the world largest producer, world production may still be above consumption this year. Another concern for the company has been the depreciation in the Brazilian real and Indian rupee, while the company’s significant debt is in dollars. The entire process will take time to consummate due to regulatory issues as well as procedural lag.
 
 An extraordinary general meeting has been convened on March 21 to seek shareholder approval, Murkumbi said that once regulators as well as shareholders approve the deal, the promoters will make an open offer for a 26% stake.
 
 In the second stage, a rights issue will be unveiled to raise Rs 725 crore. Until this entire exercise is over --which could take four to six months -- the company is not expected to secure any benefit either by way of reduced interest costs or operational synergies.
 
 “The deal valuation leaves nothing for the retail shareholders. They are not likely to benefit out of it,” said Nilesh Karani, VP Research, Magnum Broking.
 
 The first phase of the deal, which will entail a preferential allotment of 257.5 million shares to Wilmar, will expand the current equity base of the company by 38%.
 
 This dilution will lower the per share earnings for retail shareholders, whenever the company is back in the black."

 Elections are the major trigger for 2014 and investors expect that the new government would take strong decisions for the growth, Religare Retail Research said in a note.
 
 The important factors that may affect the stock market in the year 2014 are global and domestic market environment, inflation, interest rate scenario, fiscal/trade scenario in India and policy actions from the next government, among other things, added the report.
 
 Religare is of the view that volatility may continue as the US Fed decision for QE will play a major role. However, the volatility should be used to pick strong fundamental stocks for long term.
 
 The brokerage firm selected following four stocks for the year 2014. It believes the strong growth potential and robust business model of these companies could be rewarding for investors.
 
 
1) Britannia Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1,050
 
 The company expects sustained growth in both bakery and dairy segments in FY14-15. Its growth is expected to be driven via heavy investment in advertising and promotions as well as infrastructure investments, both in the premium and discount segments.
 
 The company expects that it would continue to drive profitable growth in an extremely competitive environment with focus on consumers, customers and cost-effectiveness.
 
 
2) Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd: Target price set at Rs 610
 
 The product pipelines of the company for FY14 are strong and resilient. This fiscal year could witness some more positive action during the second and third quarters as the outlicensing deal with Sanofi could show pleasant progress.
 
 The company has also received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to launch Crofelemer, a drug used for HIV-linked diarrhea. The company is currently preparing to file for approvals to launch this medication in 140 countries.
 
 
3) Jyothi Laboratories Ltd: Target price set at Rs 225
 
 The company has revitalized its flagship brand and also rejigged its detergents portfolio acquired from Henkel. It is likely to launch new products in the personal care space.
 
 To increase awareness of its brands, the company has identified seven power brands that'll be marketed aggressively. Now the company aims to increase its turnover three-fold to Rs 3,000 crore in the next three years.
 
 
4) Rallis India Ltd: Target price set at Rs 210
 
 The company believes that there is a big opportunity in the Indian agrochemical industry as the usage of pesticides in India is one of the lowest in the world with 0.48 kg/ha whereas average world consumption is around 3-5 kg/ha and only 35-40% of the farmland is under crop protection.
 
 The company is strengthening its organic portfolio and focusing on agrochemicals that account for about 85% of its business. It plans to increase its presence in the seeds business and focus on exports.

Reckitt Benckiser names Nitish Kapoor as India MD,"{""Reckitt Benckiser"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/reckitt-benckiser-elevates-india-md-nitish-kapoor-to-global-leadership-role/articleshow/61565898.cms,m.economictimes.com,Reckitt Benckiser elevates India MD Nitish Kapoor to global leadership role,"British consumer goods and healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser has elevated its India managing director Nitish Kapoor into a global leadership role, as part of a sweeping restructuring of operations globally.
 
 Kapoor, who led the India operations for four years and was also RB’s senior vice-president for South Asia, will now head the company’s health business in North America. He will move to the US and report to global chief executive Rakesh Kapoor.
 
 The new structure will be implemented starting the first quarter of 2018.
 
 Under Kapoor, RB India had posted sales of Rs 5,606 crore in fiscal 2016, an expansion of 14% over the previous financial year. Growth was fuelled by improved higher direct distribution in rural markets, introduction of packs at entry-level price points in brands such as Dettol and Harpic, and the ‘Banega Swachh’ campaign to leverage the sanitation brands.
 
 An RB India spokesperson confirmed the development. “RB has reorganised its business, globally, into two units: RB Health and RB Hygiene Home. Nitish Kapoor, currently senior VP South Asia, is moving as executive vice president, RB Health, North America, based in the US.”
 
 RB India will also have two heads — one each for health and hygiene businesses — instead of one overall chief executive.
 
 Gaurav Jain is being appointed as senior vice president Africa, the Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) for RB Health. He will also take charge of the India health business. Narasimhan Eswar is being appointed as senior vice president, South Asia-RB Home Hygiene, and will be looking after the India hygiene home business.
 
 Both executives are internal recruits.
 
 The maker of Dettol soap, Air Wick air freshener and Veet hair remover announced its decision to split its businesses globally last year to sharpen its focus and fuel growth in a challenging market. RB Health is a 7.5 billion pound business.
 
 “RB is embracing bold changes when needed, to continue to create disproportionate shareholder value. The new structure also reinforces the prowess that RB has when it comes to growing diverse talent and building a culture of merit and performance,” said Vibhav Dhawan, managing partner of executive search and consulting firm Positive Moves Consulting.
 
 US baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition, which Reckitt Benckiser acquired for £14.2-billion in June this year, will be part of RB Health. RB Hygiene Home will have brands such as Lysol, Vanish, Finish and Air Wick, and is a five billion pounds business.
 
 In its latest reported earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, RB had reduced its full-year sales outlook, with its net revenue falling 1% to £3.2 billion. The company said it is expecting sales to be flat in the full year, down from a previous target of 2%. RB has struggled with weak sales in recent months, owing to a subdued consumption environment and the Petya ransomware attack earlier this year. The cyber attack had severely impacted the company's ability to make and export products to some markets."
"RBI, bourses weigh dollar delivery in futures trade","{""RBI"": ""neutral"", ""bourses"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/rbi-bourses-weigh-dollar-delivery-in-futures-trade/articleshow/20850701.cms,m.economictimes.com,"RBI, bourses weigh dollar delivery in futures trade","MUMBAI: A choppy rupee is making financial regulators look for ways to cut blind bets in currency futures and make life a little easier for small importers, who have been the worst hit by the rupee’s fall. 

 The Reserve Bank of India and exchanges are exploring the possibility of actual delivery of dollars in bourses where currency futures are traded. At present, futures contracts are cash-settled and do not result in physical delivery of dollars or any other foreign currency. 

 “There are discussions to figure out whether businessmen can be given the choice to take or give dollars. Understandably, exchanges will have to tie up with banks that can arrange the dollars,” said an official familiar with the proposal. 

 Many perceive that hedging – or covering the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations – can be less expensive in an exchange than buying or selling forward dollars with a bank in the regular and much larger OTC exchange. 

 In a currency futures exchange, a small firm as well as a large corporate are offered the same rate, unlike in the less transparent OTC market where a bank may quote a better rate to a large corporate that generates other businesses. “Also, if a section of the market prefers physical dollar delivery, the degree of naked speculation would come down… But one doesn’t know whether this would make the rupee stable or the absence of alarge number of speculators would bring down liquidity in certain contracts,” said a currency trader. 

 Unlike the OTC market where a forward position can be taken only against a real undertaking (like export receivable or import payable), positions in currency futures require no such underlying. What may have kept away many small companies from currency futures is the need to monitor their margins with the intermediary on a daily basis and the compulsion to replenish margins if the market goes against it. 

 The proposal (to allow delivery and physical settlement in dollars) crops up at a time the central bank has to take a call on whether foreign institutional investors (FII) should be allowed to trade in currency futures. After the recent drop in the rupee, the regulator has to think through the subject. The entry of FIIs in currency futures could shift billions of dollars of trades on the rupee that currently happen in offshore markets like Singapore and London, to India. Even though RBI never openly admits the existence of such markets, it’s fully aware of their activities and even takes steps to minimize chances of volatility in the offshore market boiling over to the Indian foreign exchange market. 

 Currency has always been a touchy issue for RBI, which hunts for ways to reduce volatility whenever the rupee is under pressure. A year ago it restrained banks from covering their OTC positions in the currency futures exchange. In other words, a buy or sell position in OTC can be reversed or sold in OTC itself (and not in currency exchanges). 

 “Allowing FIIs to hedge in currency futures along with allowing companies to take delivery of foreign currency in exchanges may be a good idea. But in such times RBI has to decide carefully,” said a banker.

RBI Deputy Governor Anand Sinha retires,"{""RBI"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/rbi-deputy-governor-anand-sinha-retires/articleshow/29122013.cms,m.economictimes.com,RBI Deputy Governor Anand Sinha retires,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Anand Sinha, who was looking after the new bank licence process has retired, even as procedure of granting licences to the private sector is yet to be completed. 

 His portfolio has been allocated to other three Deputy Governors. 

 It is also believed that Sinha will be appointed as an adviser to the central bank for a period of three months so that his expertise can be utilised for shortlisting of applicants for bank licences. 

 Initially, 26 entities evinced interest in entering the banking arena. Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, withdrew its application in November, leaving 25 players in the fray. 

 Public sector units India Post and IFCI, private sector Anil Ambani group and Aditya Birla group submitted applications on July 1. Besides, Bajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Religare Enterprises and Shriram Capital have applied for licences. 

 The Finance Minister and RBI Governor at several occasions had said that bank licences to corporates would be granted by the end of current fiscal. 

 ""I hope to announce the licences within, or soon after, the term of Deputy Governor Anand Sinha who has been shepherding the process. His term expires January 2014,"" RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had said in his first media briefing after taking charge from D Subbarao. 

 RBI in a statement said the portfolios are allocated among three other Deputy Governors-- K C Chakrabarty, H R Khan and Urjit Patel. 

 ""The RBI has reallocated the portfolios among the three Deputy Governors from Monday, January 20, 2014. The reallocation was necessitated consequent upon Anand Sinha relinquishing his charge as Deputy Governor,"" RBI said in a release. 

 Sinha was reappointed as the Deputy Governor of RBI for 11 months till January 18, 2014 in February last year. 

 He looked after the Department of Banking Operations and Development, the Department of Non-Banking Supervision and the Urban Banks Department, Departments of Risk Monitoring, Information Technology, Expenditure and Budgetary Control, Legal and Premises. 

 K C Chakrabarty has been given additional portfolio of Legal and Premises Department, Urban Banks Department. 

 H R Khan will get additional charge of Department of Banking Operations and Development, Department of Non-Banking Supervision and Urban Banks Department and Department of Information Technology. 

 While Urjit Patel gets the Department of Expenditure & Budgetary Control and Risk Monitoring as additional portfolios. 

 RBI said that the portfolio will be reallocated upon appointment of a new Deputy Governor."

RBI bets on 'shut period' to improve liquidity,"{""RBI"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/rbi-says-liquidity-rebalancing-evolved-satisfactorily-holds-repo-auction-amid-gst-outflow/articleshow/89019436.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,RBI says liquidity rebalancing evolved satisfactorily; holds repo auction amid GST outflow,"NEW DELHI – The Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to rebalance the quantum of surplus liquidity in the banking system by shifting the excess funds from the overnight fixed-rate reverse window to variable rate reverse repo facilities has evolved satisfactorily, the central bank said on Thursday.

“As stated in Governor’s statement of December 8, 2021, the Reserve Bank has been rebalancing the surplus liquidity in the system by shifting it out of the fixed-rate overnight reverse repo window into the variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions of longer maturity. Overall, this rebalancing has proceeded on a pre-announced glide path and has evolved satisfactorily,” the RBI said through a press release on its website.

The central bank said that it would carry on rebalancing liquidity conditions in a non-disruptive manner while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the productive sectors of the economy. ""With larger than anticipated collections under the goods and services tax (GST), system liquidity has tightened in this week,"" it said.

After a long hiatus, the RBI announced and conducted a variable rate repo auction as overnight money market rates had hardened this week due to larger-than-anticipated collections under the goods and services tax.

The overnight variable rate repo auction, which had a notified amount of Rs 50,000 crore, drew bids worth Rs 65,700 crore, with the cutoff rate being set at 4.06 per cent. The weighted average rate was 4.10 per cent.

In a repo operation, the central bank lends out funds to banks in exchange for government securities.

In the December monetary policy review, the central bank had said that it aims to make the 14-day variable rate reverse repo auction, the primary route for liquidity absorption.

Following large-scale liquidity infusions by the central bank amid the coronavirus pandemic, liquidity in the banking system has swollen to record highs, with the surplus estimated at around Rs 7 lakh crores last week.

The central bank’s efforts to nudge banks to park funds at longer-tenure variable rate reverse repo auctions have not always met with success though, with some such auctions seeing poor participation as banks were averse to lending out cash for longer periods.

Some market participants have also questioned the efficacy of the step, given that a significant portion of the liquidity surplus rests on the books of mutual funds, which are not permitted access to the RBI’s reverse repo window.

Managing liquidity conditions in the banking system is a tricky job for the RBI at the moment as inflation in India remains well above the central bank’s own targets, while central banks in advanced economies are progressively moving towards tighter monetary policies.

Even as economic growth still requires much support amid the COVID pandemic, it seems a foregone conclusion that the RBI will have to proactively tackle the liquidity surplus in the banking system and consider raising interest rates to be in sync with both global and domestic inflationary developments."
Raw material bull market fades as supply expands,"{""Raw material"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/raw-material-bull-market-fades-as-supply-expands/articleshow/19353111.cms,m.economictimes.com,Raw material bull market fades as supply expands,"LONDON: At a time when US equities are trading near a record and the dollar is having its best start in three years, commodities will finish this quarter little changed from where they were at the end of 2012. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials will be at 644 at the end of June, 1.2% lower than now, according to the median of nine investor and analyst predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The index rose 0.8% this year, the worst start since 2003. 

 Arabica coffee, silver and nickel will gain as cotton, crude and natural gas fall, analyst forecasts show. Investors had $132 billion tracking commodity indexes in February, Barclays estimates. Supplies of everything from copper to sugar to oil are now catching up with or exceeding demand after the S&P GSCI's almost fourfold advance since the end of 2001 spurred new mines, wells and crop acreage. 

 While the International Monetary Fund expects global economic growth to accelerate to 3.5% this year, from 3.2% in 2012, the Washington-based group cut its estimate three times since July. The 17-nation euro area already tumbled back into its second recession in three years. 

 ""No one is really concerned we're going to have any shortages,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, the Toronto-based company ranked by Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster on Brent oil and third-best in industrial metals over the past two years. 

 ""The big complaint is the inventories are probably a bit too high. It's difficult for us, given the supply configurations across the commodity spectrum, to say that we're going to see a lot of upside."" 

 The S&P GSCI beat the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities, the US Dollar Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index of bonds in six of the past 11 years. Commodities entered a bull market in August as the worst US drought since the 1930s drove crop prices to records and oil rallied. The gauge retreated about 4% since then and ended 2012 at 646.58. 

 Nine of the 24 items in the S&P GSCI are in bear markets, having declined at least 20% from their recent highs. They account for less than 17% of the index weightings, with New York oil, gasoil and heating oil still in bull markets. Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks fell 24% to $6 billion last year, the first drop since at least 2008, according to Coalition, an analytics company. Goldman Sachs ranked first in 2012, followed by JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, the London-based group estimates. 

 Smaller price swings may be curbing profit. The 100-day measure of volatility in the S&P GSCI dropped to 11.5 on March 18, the lowest since 1996, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The commodities supercycle, or longer-than-average period of rising prices, is over, Citigroup said in a November report. 

 China, the biggest user of everything from copper to cotton to coal, is slowing and years of higher prices encouraged more supply, the bank said. The retreat in raw materials in February reinforced that view, Ed Morse, the global head of commodities research in New York, said in an e-mail March 25."

  Ranbaxy is pretty much a day trading and a short term buying idea. Not all pharmas are defensive, Ranbaxy is not a defensive pharma but every now and then it will make a pretty good move and it is doing exactly that. Short side, this is there only if the market starts going down. There is no point shorting in a rising market but we often have this 11 o’clock or a little bit later a reversal in the market. If that comes today, then a good short sale for intraday traders would be OnMobile Global, that is not doing much yet today and it has done pretty poorly in the last few weeks."

  The BSE metal index has been a poor performer in the recent past. The index faces a strong resistance around 15700 and even in the last three weeks, we see that the index has turned from 15250 around, so a pullback rally could maximum do up to 15500 or 15700. 
  
  On Ramsarup, I see the stock has been trending between 70 and 90 for quite sometime now and the upside is capped at 90, so unless it breaks above that, very little to take on the stock."

Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Is it time to put money to work or is this the time where you need to clean up whatever you can get?The obvious view point here is that you sit tight in a situation like this and stay with good quality stocks in your portfolio. Some of the good quality stocks have also fallen and it is going to test your patience. We are observing that the market takes time to reward good quality stocks but they keep getting rewarded in subsequent period of time also. 
 
Today there is a situation of fear in the marketplace. People are unsure about where exactly some of the banks or the NBFC problem could hurt or hit some genuine companies in respective space. That is where we are telling people to stay with good quality promoters and the companies. Some of the stocks in the midcap and even in the largecap space are becoming attractive now and one should start looking at them with an investment horizon of one year and above. 
 
This fear factor will recede at some point of time and that is where we will find value in some of the good quality investment stocks which can reward you eventually. It is time to remain a little bit cautious. That does not mean one should be a pessimist. This country and economy offer huge opportunities. So do not be pessimistic. One should be realistic and sit on cash for some time and accumulate good quality stocks.


Will you be a buyer in Emami because the supply promoter overhang is clearly over?One sensible thing which is happening is the promoter group is basically paying off their debt and whichever way they are paying off, it is a good thing to observe. The second most important thing and that is where I would like to see the direction coming from Indian promoters. They are probably spread too thin in too many areas of business. At a promoter level, you should have a journey in some select areas and try and make the size as your destination. 
 
Many of the promoters have spread into too many businesses and that is going to be a problem area for them. The sooner those promoter groups consolidate and stay focussed, where they can register their mark by becoming a right size company I guess would be the one thing to look at. 
 
As of now, we do not get that kind of a signal from any of the promoter groups including Emami and that is where discomfort would be since they are spread too thin, It is not the time to look at them even though they may be correcting their past and bringing capital back to give shareholders relative comfort. I would like to see a clear focus on a select group of businesses and not too many areas. 
 

Earnings are not there generally and good quality stocks are super expensive. The slowdown in the consumer space is a reality and the delayed monsoon could create further stress on the agrarian economy. It clearly appears that for next 6, 8, 10 months, this market is gone.There are concerns over some of the factors which you have mentioned. Monsoon is definitely a concern. In next two-three months, we hope to get good rains and that is how we would probably remain relatively more confident going forward. 
 
As far as the consumption space is concerned, the solution lies in bringing down the rate of interest. Today for a variety of reasons, the banks and institutions have not been able to bring down the rate of interest. May be the argument going forward would be that can the country bring differential rate of interest wherein on one side you have the infrastructure projects which needs investment but which are not investing because of the high cost of funds. On the other side, the consumer wants to spend again and needs to know where to put his money at a lower cost of funds. This is a situation where a differential rate of interest could help relatively better investment on the consumption side as well as on the infrastructure spending side. 
 
What is common for both the sectors is that if an increase in spending takes place, then that may lead to revival in the economy or growth in corporate sector earnings. So, one is going to influence the other. Lower cost of interest will influence the higher rate of growth and that is where one would like to argue for bringing down the rate of interest. How soon, how fast will depend on the actions from the government side."

Purvankara will spend close to Rs 75 crore dolling out dividend to its shareholders, while the promoters will take home only Rs 19.19 crore as 20% dividend. 

 The public shareholding in Purvankara is 9.04% while the promoters hold 89.96%, which they have to cut to 75% to satisfy Sebi's minimum public share holding norms. Investment banker JP Morgan has the mandate and Purvankara will sell shares through an IPP for around Rs 110 apiece, said a source involved with the deal. Puravankara has a m-cap of Rs 2,245 crore based on Wednesday's closing price on BSE. 

 Each Puravankara share has a face value of Rs 5 and public shareholders will get a dividend of Rs 3.5 per share. This makes it a dividend yield of 3.5% for shareholders of Puravankara based on closing the closing share price of Tuesday. The share price rose by 7% to close at Rs 105.2 on Wednesday after it declared the dividend. 

 Among real estate companies with a market-cap more than Rs 100 crore, only Kolte Patil Developers, at 4.11%, based on its last declared dividend, has a dividend yield higher than Puravankara. 

 ""The move raises the bar for corporate governance at a time minority shareholders feel short-changed every now and then. Real estate companies like DLF, Unitech and HDIL are unable to service their debt. Any such gesture by a company gives a good signal to the market,"" said an analyst of a Mumbai-based brokerage. 

 ""Giving a higher dividend to non-promoters is good for existing shareholders of the company but prospective shareholders should also look at various other parameters before investing,"" said Phani Shekhar, fund manager at Angel Broking. He said Purvankara's project execution was better than many of its peers and even its debt pile was less than peers like DLF and HDIL, among others."

 CPSE-ETF is an open-ended scheme comprising 10 major PSUs such as ONGC, Gail and Coal India. The new fund offer will open for subscription on March 18 for anchor investors (investing above Rs 10 crore) and the next day for non-anchor and retail investors.
 
 ""Though ETF is a very popular (investment vehicle) globally, it is at a nascent stage in India. Also, equity ETFs are yet to gain traction here. Through the CPSE-ETF, the Government is trying to make this product popular,"" Alok Tandon, Joint Secretary, Disinvestment Department, told reporters at the launch here.
 
 The new index is another option of Government divesting stake in public sector enterprises, he said.
 
 The Government plans to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore from this scheme in the outgoing fiscal, Tandon added.
 
 Describing the scheme's benefits, he said it provides a sound opportunity for investors to be part of the top 10 PSUs - ONGC, Gail, Coal India, IndianOil, Oil India, PFC, REC, Container Corp, Bharat Electronics and Engineers India.
 
 ""While 5 per cent upfront discount will be offered to all class of investors, 6.66 per cent loyalty units (one loyalty unit for every 15 units held) will be provided for retail individual investors,"" he said.
 
 The scheme is managed by Goldman Sachs India MF and will be listed on exchanges in the form of an ETF.
 
 Asked about any further ETF involving listed government firms, the Joint Secretary said it will depend on investor response to the current scheme."
PSU bonds match equity returns in fourth quarter,"{""PSU bonds"": ""neutral"", ""equity"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/psu-bonds-match-equity-returns-in-fourth-quarter/articleshow/33196481.cms,m.economictimes.com,PSU bonds match equity returns in fourth quarter,"MUMBAI: All eyes might be on equities but tax-free bonds offered by state-owned companies in the January-March period have silently returned close to stock market gains. Investors have seen between 4% and 7% capital appreciation in their investment within this short span of time.
 
 Towards the end of the financial year, public sector issuers such as NTPC, National Housing Bank (NHB) and Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC) to name a few brought a series of public issuances offering between 8% and 9% coupon broadly for 10,15 and 20 years. “Those bonds offer very attractive rates over a long period,” said Suresh Sadagopan, principal planner, Ladder 7 Financial, an advisory firm.
 
 “Perhaps, we are going through the peak of interest rates. Even if there is capital appreciation, retail investors should hold it till maturity for higher long-term returns.” For example, a particular series of NHB bonds which were issued at a face value of Rs 5,000 per bond during the March quarter on Thursday quoted the last trading price of Rs 5,321 in the secondary market, suggesting a capital appreciation of 6.4%.
 
 Similarly, NHPC bonds rose to an intraday high of Rs 1,072 compared with a face value of Rs 1,000, an appreciation of more than 7%. The 30-share BSE Sensex has moved up 8% in the last three months. Even though a comparison between equity and debt may not be justified as they are two different asset classes, an investor with less risk appetite can earn good returns in bonds.
 
 In its first bi-monthly policy, the Reserve Bank of India hinted at keeping interest rates unchanged till the time the central bank attains 8% retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index, or CPI. If the rate of inflation keeps falling, there are rate cut chances, which may begin in 2015. As the country achieves higher pace of growth with falling inflation, interest rates may be cut.
 
 Most of those issuers were AAA-rated, barring HUDCO, which was assigned AA+, one notch lower. But, the government ownership is the key trigger that makes all these a safe investment bet.
 
 “It does not make sense for investors to exit investments booking profit at this point unless there is a compulsion,” said Amit Kukreja, founder of WealthBeing Advisors. “In case of selling, investors will attract shortterm capital gain tax as per individual income tax slab, which, in turn, will erode absolute returns.”"

  What are your views on the power sector?
  
  In terms of stock if you look at power as a sector, we are neutral, and our top pick is NTPC with a target price of Rs 202. We had a sell call on Neyveli Lignite earlier, and the stock has corrected and roundabout Rs 100 levels, it becomes a hold. The best part is that the company has all fully depreciated plants but then again going forward, the growth visibility is still lacking because the capex is still not happening as it should have been because of which we had a sell rating. Probably we will look at this stock afresh post this announcement but I do not think we are very bullish on the power sector as a whole for the next 12 months. We prefer NTPC because it has got a little far lesser fuel risk compared to some of the other players, which are banking on merchant or the regulated ones also."
Participate in power through other sectors: Vijai Mantri,"{""power"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/participate-in-power-through-other-sectors-vijai-mantri/articleshow/35506198.cms,m.economictimes.com,Participate in power through other sectors: Vijai Mantri,"In a chat with ET Now, Vijai Mantri, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Pramerica Mutual Fund shares his views on Power companies. 

 
ET Now: Let us talk about power as a group. Now the power index only in the month of May has appreciated by about 30%. Some part of the price action in power stocks could be mean reversion but nothing will change for Indian power sector in next six months, next 12 months because there is still no fuel supply, plant load factors are at a historic low and most of the power companies have broken balance sheets. So do you think somewhere power stocks are now not only running but running way ahead of their fundamentals? 

 
Vijai Mantri: It is very difficult to pinpoint on the power sector because many companies are new and they do not have a robust business model. So it is not necessary that you have to participate in the power sector by investing only in the power companies. You could participate in that either by investing in the capital goods companies or the banking stocks or NBFCs. If you look at the track record of Narendra Modi in Gujarat, he has increased the power capacity in the state by multiple times and he assured people that you will see 24 power power supply coming in your household. So very clearly what are the bottlenecks you have seen and most of them are linked with the few linkages and the policy related, that will be ironed out over a period of time. So the kind of hammering these stocks have gone through, 30% in my opinion is too less. Most of the stocks are down by 80% to 90% from the historical high. So you will see more gain coming out from the power sector but if you want to see visibility of the earnings coming, then it is not necessary that you have to participate only through power sector, you can participate in the same story through other sectors as well."

There are fundamental factors, besides rupee, influencing the industry's growth in the short to medium-term. Drug companies' performance stands impacted by these factors in the coming quarters:
 
 1. Pace of Drug Approvals in the US has picked up, clearing the way for companies to launch more products in the US. Companies like Lupin, Aurobindo and Glenmark have received a series of approvals in the recent months.
 
 2. Punitive Regulatory Action by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) remains a potential risk, dimming the exports prospects of the company facing the clamps. Sun Pharma and Ipca Labs continue to work towards attaining full regulatory compliance.
 
 

 
 3. Customer Consolidation in the US is changing the existing equation for Indian drug sellers. A handful of retailers control most of the purchasing of generic drugs. Companies like Dr Reddy's and Lupin have faced price erosion in the US on this account.
 
 4. Volumes Growth in Domestic Market has been on a recovery, auguring well for companies with leading presence in the local market. Companies like Astrazeneca Pharma, Glenmark and Torrent have outperformed the rest in recent months.
 
 5. Price Control in the domestic market remains a sore point, especially if prices of more drugs are brought under the control regime.
 
 6. MNCs in India have become aggressive in launching products in the domestic market.
 
 7. The growth of MNCs have outpaced that of the Indian companies in the last two months.

Seven rules for investing in penny stocks,"{""penny stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/seven-rules-for-investing-in-penny-stocks/articleshow/48305040.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Seven rules for investing in penny stocks,"Despite the risks, small investors are putting big money in low-priced penny stocks. They are lured by the fantastic returns that some stocks have delivered in the past few months. If you also want to invest in this risky segment of the market, keep a few rules in mind.
 
 
1. Don’t invest large amounts
 
 Don’t lean too much on these risky investments. Penny stocks should not account for more than 10% of your total equity portfolio. This means if your total investment portfolio is Rs 20 lakh and 30% (or Rs 6 lakh) is in stocks, then the maximum you should put in these high-risk stocks is Rs 60,000. Invest only what you can afford to lose.
 
 
2. Invest only in 2-3 stocks
 
 The principle of diversification does not work here. Instead of picking up a large number of penny stocks, invest in only a handful of scrips. Spreading your money across a basket of low-priced stocks will not let you earn meaningful returns from them.
 
 If you have Rs 3,000 invested in a stock and it gives a return of 25% in a month, the gain will be an insignificant Rs 750. Besides, it is easier to monitor 2-3 stocks rather than a portfolio of 10-15 low priced stocks.
 
 
3. Don’t invest and forget
 
 Investing in penny stocks should be seen as a short-term gambit, not a long-term strategy. If the stock witnesses a sharp rise, it may be time to exit or at least book partial profits. Some investors might think that if they wait for a year, the gains will be tax free. But the stock may have fallen by then. Set a target and exit when it is achieved. Don’t hold penny stocks forever.
 
 
4. Don’t believe anyone
 
 The online forums of financial portals are awash with advice and information on penny stocks. Don’t believe a word of what other investors have to offer. In this segment, everybody is in search of the greater fool who will pay a higher price for the junk in their portfolio. Also, take the claims of the management with a pinch of salt. They usually paint a rosy picture.
 
 
5. Buy stocks with high volumes
 
 Some penny stocks are very thinly traded. For instance, the average daily volume of Titan Securities for the past 1 month has been only 3 shares. So if you have 5,000 shares of the company, it will be quite difficult to offload them when you want to exit the stock. Buy stocks that have reasonably high trading volumes so that there is ample liquidity. Don’t look only at one day’s trading but consider the monthly average.
 
 
6. Don’t try to average your purchases
 
 If you bought a share at Rs 6 and it is now trading at Rs 3, don’t try to average out your purchase by buying more of it. You may end up digging a bigger hole for yourself and lose more money. Don’t get anchored to a price and be ready to book losses if an investment goes wrong. You should improve the average by selling some shares when the price starts moving up, rather than buying more when it goes down.
 
 
7. Never let success change your strategy
 
 They say the four most dangerous words in the market are “It’s different this time”. Investors who make early gains tend to get carried away by overconfidence and start making mistakes. Do not forget the six rules of investing given above if you don’t want to lose your shirt in this market."

  The board has named Pawan Hans Ltd chairman & managing director RK Tyagi as its second choice for the post of chairman & managing director of ONGC. 
  
  The panel’s recommendation will be sent to the appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC), which will take a final call, one of them said. Mr Vasudeva has been actively involved for about 19 years in development and management of the Mumbai High, India’s prime oil asset.

Analysts are advising against buying shares of these companies as they are expected to remain under pressure until global crude prices decline further and the rupee stabilises.

The government on Wednesday said it has approved a one-time grant of ₹22,000 crore to these PSUs for selling liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or cooking gas at prices below market. OMC shares, which have drifted lower in recent months, edged 1-3% higher earlier in Wednesday's session but the gains fizzled out soon.
""OMCs will continue the downward trend,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities. ""We expected a temporary bounce that could be used to book profit but there are no signs of bottom reversal in these stocks.""
 
IOC shares, which advanced as much as 2.8%, closed at ₹67.30 apiece, up 2.05%. The stock has a crucial support at ₹65, breaching it could take the stock down to ₹61-62 levels, said Shetti.

BPCL gained 1% to end at ₹302.65, while HPCL surrendered all its gains to end marginally in the red at ₹210.15.

HPCL shares may find support around ₹206, and breaking that would take it down to ₹197, a downside of 6.2% from the current levels, said Shetti. BPCL may find support around ₹285 and breaching it would take the stock around ₹275-276 levels, down about 9%, he said.

""The only thing that can change the negative outlook on OMCs is if crude oil prices ease to $70-80 a barrel,"" said Swarnendu Bhushan, vice president, research - oil and gas, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""Due to elevated crude oil prices, OMCs generated steep losses on petrol and diesel. The talks of subsidy packages may not be sufficient to cover the losses incurred in the previous quarter.""

Brent crude prices have surged more than 20% to around $94 per barrel so far this year on account of the Russia-Ukraine war. It spiked to as high as $139.13 earlier this year due to the supply crunch after the US and western European nations imposed sanctions on Russia, world's third-largest producer of oil. Since January, shares of IOC, BPCL and HPCL have lost 11-29% on the back of weak auto fuel marketing margins and a steep fall in refining margins.

Besides the increases in crude prices, the Indian economy is facing a double-whammy due to the sharp declines in the rupee against the dollar. 

On Monday, the rupee fell to its all-time low of 82.68 to a dollar, down 10.5% since January."

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for April delivery, rose 11 cents to 40.07 dollars a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 23 cents to 42.27. ""The markets are sort of still in search of indicators for demand and whether OPEC cuts are going to hold in the long run and support prices,"" said Jason Feer, Asia Pacific vice-president for energy market analysts Argus Media Ltd. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which pumps about 40 percent of the world's oil, announced output cuts late last year of more than four million barrels per day in a bid to reverse tumbling prices and protect revenues. Barclays Capital said in a report Tuesday that the oil market was currently facing ""something of a hiatus,"" marked by macroeconomic uncertainty and lack of any definitive direction in the flow of market data. The New York price, slightly lower in early Asian trade Wednesday, rose slightly as US President Barack Obama made his debut address to a joint session of Congress. In a blizzard of proposals, programmes and reforms, the president demanded an overhaul of financial regulation and warned he may need more than the 700 billion dollars already earmarked to save the debt-riddled finance industry. ""Demand concerns remain prevalent on the energy markets, so the upside continues to be limited and we could be in for more sideways trading,"" said Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital."

NSE operationalises SME platform with first listing,"{""NSE"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/nse-operationalises-sme-platform-with-first-listing/articleshow/16449372.cms,m.economictimes.com,NSE operationalises SME platform with first listing,"\New Delhi: Top stock exchange NSE today launched operations of its new trading platform for SMEs, Emerge, with the first listing in this segment and said some more companies would follow. 

 The platform was launched by Finance Minister P Chidambaram, along with Sebi Chairman U K Sinha, with the listing of Thejo Engineering -- the first company to get listed in NSE's Emerge segment. 

 Talking to reporters after the launch, NSE Managing Director Ravi Narain said that the exchange has been very careful in brining in only good-quality companies on the platform and there was ""quite a decent number of companies"" interested in getting listed. 

 He, however, did not divulge the exact number of the companies that NSE expects on the Emerge platform. 

 ""NSE would provide all the required hand-holding to the companies interested in getting listed on Emerge,"" NSE's Joint Managing Director Chitra Ramkrishna said. 

 Narain said the turnover was expected to remain modest on the platform initially and it was not driven by a revenue- earning model. 

 However, the platform would help in developing the eco- system and provide the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) a much-needed avenue to raise capital from the equity market. 

 ""At times, it is difficult for these small companies to get credit, but here we are talking about helping them get the equity risk capital,"" he said. 

 Narain, however, said that the Emerge platform was very different from London Stock Exchange's AIM platform, as there have been no relaxations in regulatory framework for such segments in India. 

 Asked about the competition from BSE, whose SME platform has already got seven listed companies, Narain said that the NSE would bring in innovation to its model. 

 ""Beyond the capital market Sebi's requirements, we have added two more things -- voluntary rating and voluntary due diligence -- for the companies desiring to get listed on Emerge,"" he said. 

 Ramkrishna said, meanwhile, that the exchange would also put out research reports about the Emerge-listed companies on its website for the benefit of the investors. 

 The platform would seek to safeguard the interest of the companies, investors as well as market intermediaries, she said. 

 Companies would get the option for trading in continuous market, or through call-auction mechanism.

  5300 is still being held by the Nifty which is not too much of a down dip. But going forward for expiry do you think we will have a substantial close above that and may be even 5400 in the annual?
  
  We have kept in very close to the last market top that was 5400 and a bit and today’s reaction, though it’s over 100, it is nevertheless in keeping with little bit of a global reaction. So at the moment there is nothing very alarming about it. It has to see whether it gains downward momentum from here, that’s the only look out. If we see the market bouncing back again tomorrow and day after, that means the uptrend is still very much in that."

Eventually, we will head towards levels of around 7930-7940 which were the recent lows a few days back and those levels should be revisited.  Now, it would be fine taking out of long positions, waiting for the correction to play out. I have got two sell calls. The first one is on Aurobindo Pharma that has already started falling but around 830, it can be sold with the stop at 851, for a first price target of 815 and a sell on ACC with a stop at 1481, for targets of around 1430-1440 on the downside."

Nifty February futures closed above 5200 levels with 14 points premium, 37 points gains and 14 per cent increase in Open Interest (OI). Put Call Ratio (V) after trading above one for the consecutive three trading days dropped to 0.87, which shows a lot of activity was seen in Calls. Overall, long build-up was seen. In entire December series, 5300 levels also have been one of largest OI gainers and in February series maximum OI was seen on 5300/5200/5400/5500 Calls and also highest long build-up was seen in 5300 Calls and OI was up by 52 per cent, which shows the 5300 level may prove effective resistance for further price advance. In February series, maximum OI was seen in 5000/4900/5100/5200 Puts. On December 31, short build-up was seen in 5100 Put and OI was up by 44 per cent, which shows effective support from 5100 levels may also be seen. Trading bias may remain upside as long as the Nifty trades above 5100 levels. As per US markets’ technicals, Dow Jones has been trading in the 10550-10230 range for the past five weeks and the Nifty is still hovering around 5200 levels. Overall, the range-bound scenario in 4900-5300 seems to be taking place. Only, on maintaining above 5300 levels any unidirectional rally may be seen. Good OI increase with positive price movements was seen in the consumer durables sector. Good open interest increase and negative price movement was seen in FMCG and pharma sectors. Stock-wise good Open Interest build-up and positive price movement was seen in Praj Inds and Bharti Airtel.

5450-5500 is possible on Nifty: Aptart Technical Services,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/5450-5500-is-possible-on-nifty-aptart-technical-services/articleshow/5423151.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,5450-5500 is possible on Nifty: Aptart Technical Services,"Sandeep Wagle, Founder & MD, Aptart Technical Services in an interview with ET Now says that 5450-5500 is possible on Nifty.One word on the Nifty. What is the sense on the last day of the week?We have been saying this for the last two weeks. 5280-5300 is a correction, that is a resistance point. Nifty has moved up one way from 4950 to 5250-5300. So a fall of 50-100 points in fact is not yet corrected. I would expect another 50 to 100 points and that would be also fine and the move should start. The bulls are not willing to let go and the action is totally focussed on midcaps.The market is looking for fresh triggers and ahead of Q3 earnings, you think that is factored in already or what is the support levels we are working with?I would say that is being factored in. I would not say it is already factored in because we are talking of 5400-5450 on the Nifty. So some element of some sideways move before that move begins. 5450-5500 is also possible, that is around 7-8% from current levels. So if the Nifty takes some time, indices take some time here where individual stocks moving up. Reliance has already started, so maybe the front liners may follow in the next couple of days or weeks, that is healthy for the markets outside.There was a bit of a pressure on IT index yesterday. Do you think they have ability to bounce back because the ADRs have not been too bad?The fall or the correction - whatever you call it - is almost over and I am specifically talking of IT and it had already run up ahead of the market. So that was very much due. This is a time if one has sold it at higher levels book profits, it is time to start entering again. Auto looks a little weak, possibly that can drag the indices to some level, another 50-70 points whatever if it happens but IT yes, we are near intermediate bottom.But any favourites or anything that you would take off the table from IT?I would go with the front liners, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, that would be my best bets and midcaps of course that will normally follow, front liners normally lead and then midcaps outperform. So at this point of time, front liners, they have corrected a bit, they may correct in a small way, that is the time to buy.One stock that was really active yesterday, Aban Offshore, what is the rationale, what is the target price?Aban has a typical behaviour pattern in terms of the way it moves. When the move starts, it continues. If you have seen the past previous rise that has happened in Aban or even the correction, yesterday it has started the move and we have a buy in Aban between 1443 and 1410. It will not correct in a big way. We have a stop loss of 1390 and a target of 1575, we are looking at around 8% to 10% upside move. This could happen in the next 8 to 10 trading sessions.Arvind Mills, showed a bit of an uptick yesterday, 8% to 9%. At current levels would you buy and what is the target?Yes, we have a buy in Arvind. In fact Arvind and Alok both are showing a very similar pattern but this is for a quick trade talk of the next one week, 8 to 10 trading sessions. Being a small cap but you cannot count the returns in percentage. We have a target of around 49 to 50 which comes out to 15% to 20% and this should come in in the next possibly 8 to 10 trading sessions, very very clear breakout, highest volumes in the last two to three months. So that volume itself will have the momentum to push the stock upward by another 15-20%, the target being 50.Have you looked at the sugar stocks?Yes but I feel a little uncomfortable. I have been saying for the last three days, Renuka in the short term is very positive and Bajaj Hindusthan, the weekly pattern is phenomenal. Having said that, I do not say the move will start now. It can consolidate over the next two-three weeks and the move may begin. It all depends on how the Nifty pans out. If the Nifty is at 5450-5500 in the next two to three weeks, Bajaj Hindusthan will be the stock to watch.You have been looking at some strong leadership coming in from the oil and gas space. We have been looking at Aban, a lot of interest building up there. Essar Oil, another counter that clocked a pretty smart turnover in yesterday’s trade.Yes, Essar Oil has given a very clear breakout, volumes have been phenomenal over the last two to three days and it is heading for somewhere around 175-180 - that is the immediate target. If one can take a little longer view, six to eight weeks possibly, one can look at a target of even 190-195 which is our 20-25% return. This is a stock to be bought on every decline in the range of 160 to 150, a stop loss of 145.Reliance Industries yesterday closed trade above 1100. Would you buy the stock this morning given the news?I would buy this stock somewhere around 1040-1050 and I would be looking at booking profits around 1140. In short term - possibly a few weeks - I am looking at this stock in the range of 1050-1150-1140. So if one is trading for Rs 30-40 as a trader, yes I see that much upside. Beyond that I do not see it immediately because if it takes out 1150 and holds above that then the next target in Reliance could be somewhere around 1300. Frankly, I do not see that much momentum in the short term at least for the next two to three weeks. Having said that, I am not bearish also, so I would talk of range bound movement. So I will not buy at this point of time.What about Motilal Oswal Financial Services and IFCI. Is IFCI interesting to go?Not really, short term yes, possibly 7-8-10%, nothing more than that. I do not have a very clear pattern which suggests the bigger move than that but it is not weak also.So what would be your recommendation right now, avoid IFCI?I would say avoid IFCI.What about Motilal Oswal?Similar pattern. Stocks are coming out of a move. So I see a 10 to 12% upside move in all of the stocks, nothing beyond that.What is your sense in the midcap banking space? Dena Bank is looking extremely strong. Do you think there is more upside there for it?A lot of analysts have recommended Dena Bank in the last two-three days. I would say that Dena Bank once above 95, it is coming out a big rounding bottom pattern and I see a very very big move. It can go to around 140-150. But again, having said that, this is probably a three to six-month view. So I do not expect Dena Bank to just surge one way. If one has to take a long term call then I would buy Dena Bank on every decline or on breakout above 95. The target can be really big somewhere around 140-150.What about Cairn India or JP Hydro, have you looked at the charts?JP Hydro was one stock which I had recommended earlier. The move has started. I see a immediate target of 90-92 and possibly the next target is 95-96. So a very clear 10-12% up move. If you talk of Cairn, one is late because the breakout came around 293. Currently it is at around 308 and I see a move up to 314-315. So financially it may not make great sense buying Cairn at this point of time but I do not see weakness in that. I still see a further up move to around Rs 10-12.What are you particularly observing on the charts there after that buzz move on MTNL?Whatever little I understand of MTNL, it gives big moves and then that move does not follow up. I would say this is a stock which normally flatters to deceive. So I would advise caution. Yes, it is looking good, it is looking good for a target of around 93-94 which is around 7-8-10% from current levels. But if one has to buy this stock, I would wait for a Rs 2-3-4 decline and buy it at 80-81 for a target of 90-92.I read you probably expect a 30 to35% return on Walchandnagar Industries. What is the timeframe and the rationale?Walchandnagar is just about to give a breakout. I hope we have caught this stock early where traders and investors can benefit. The actual buy is around once 236 is crossed, that the momentum in the stock will start. It has closed at 226 yesterday but the volumes that have occurred in the last four-five days suggest that this is on the way of a breakout and once above 236. This stock has the potential to go to even 280-290 and that can happen very very fast. My target is 275 with a six to eight-week time horizon and below 210, this stock can become weak. So that should be the stop loss. One can hold on for a little longer time. This can even go to 310-320 somewhere around that.One stock idea or one stock that you would watch out for today morning?As I said, Walchandnagar is one stock which I would look out and a four-five day perspective also it can be bought and can give 10-12%. So I would look at buying that in the morning irrespective of wherever it opens.You are looking at the charts of Siemens this morning, what you have seen?We had recommended this stock at around 550 with the 5 to 7% trading ideas maybe last week but today it has given a weekly breakout and our next target. I would want people to hold on, next target is coming to somewhere around 725. It is currently at 630, can be bought on a little bit of a correction up to 610, stop loss being around 590 and it has the potential to go up to around 725-730. This is possibly a four to six weeks’ time call.One more day of weakness pronounced at that for Infosys, 2500. Does it break that mark down?In fact in the morning we were talking of buying Infosys and TCS at lower levels but the way it is panning out, I am not very clear on it. I still see some more downside in the IT stocks.Would you still hold that view, buy TCS and perhaps avoid Infosys right now?No, both are equally weak. So at this point of time I will not buy Infosys, I would rather avoid the IT stocks. I will wait for some confirmation because other stocks are giving a very very clear cut pattern. So I would be a little negative on the IT stocks as well."

ET Now: What are your thoughts on Wednesday’s sell-off.
 
 
Mitesh Thacker: We have been expecting such a fall for quite some time. We got that confirmation when hourly chart pointed towards some kind of breakdowns early Tuesday. Post Wednesday’s trade, one can expect Bank Nifty to test 17,500 levels. For Nifty, we have talked about levels of around 7,935-7,940.
 
 Those levels appear to be the next-short term target. So, I would continue to trade with a negative bias. Buying into put options on the indices could be good strategy.

Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: What is your sense of the how will you start of the new series? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: In terms of sectors I have a very similar outlook. I did mention that we will be exploring long positions on the banking side and look at adding short on pharma and IT. This is slightly surprising. Given the fact that if you look at the dollar-rupee equation, you will possibly look at exporters gaining over here. Technically if you look at the charts most of these stocks gain because pharma and IT are showing some kind of corrective set up. So for the time being that continues. 

 The Nifty today has broken below levels of around 8,200 and 8,180. This could possibly trigger some kind of down move and retest levels of around 8,000. So maybe next few days there will be some choppiness. Barring banks couple of PSU banks I would expect the market to drift slightly downwards, about a per cent or two per cent. Then we might look at some kind of reversal from those levels."

ET Now: What is your sense on the market over the next two sessions? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: I would want to see some kind of strength coming beyond 8950-8980 but till then the market upside would be capped and that would happen with some kind of positive news flow coming in but otherwise this is a market which will not fall aggressively therefore stock specific longs can be explored. 

 The level to watch on the downside is about 8800 as long as we are not breaking below 8800-8780 remotely, we might consolidate between 8950-8980 on the upside to about 8780 on the downside. 

 Eventually, my bias is on the upside and we should break on the upside. The key here could be the Bank Nifty which has been underperforming and that needs to start getting past 19,400 levels, once that happen you will see some kind of momentum pick up in bank which could aid the Nifty movement."

This has unleashed energy bottled up in the market on the downside. It appears, with tapering being announced by the Fed, dollar assets are likely to go back to the US and hence fund flows may be impacted to emerging markets. 
 The Nifty is likely to find stiff resistance at 6150-70, and next support is going to come at 5950. Bank Nifty will continue to underperform. Support comes at 9900-10000 and resistance at 10400. CNXIT will continue to outperform in declines, but is unlikely to move with great momentum. Key weekly levels for the Nifty will be 6025 and for Bank Nifty it will be 10176 and 9697.

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will present the final Union Budget for 2014-15 in Lok Sabha at 11:00 IST on Thursday, 10 July 2014. And on Wednesday, 9 July 2014, the Finance Ministry will table Economic Survey for 2013-14. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 12.50 points lower at 7,620 indicating flat-to-negative opening on the domestic market. 

 Hit by profit booking, the S&P BSE Sensex slipped as much as 517 points on Tuesday after hitting record highs in trade, while the 50-share Nifty index finally concluded the session with a deep cut of slightly over2% and closed at 7623. 

 On the eventful session of the Railway Budget, the benchmarks were seen declining almost vertically and lost more than two percent in the end. 

 ""We had recommended profit taking in the vicinity of 7790 to 7850. The decline witnessed today was particularly very sharp which even breached the initial support of 7650,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 ""Nifty now has a vital support in the range of 7570 - 7550 and if it manages to respect this support then there may be a bounce back till 7680 to 7700 range in next couple of sessions,"" added the report. 

 However, a breach of 7,500 on closing basis would force us to look at a deeper correction in coming weeks. 

 ""Now, it's important to see how the market reacts to the Economic Survey report which is scheduled on Wednesday i.e. 09th July, 2014,"" said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited. 

 ""On the downside, 7450 is a support area in Nifty so one should be watchful and keep the trading positions hedged,"" he added. 

 Overnight, U.S. stocks fell in a broad selloff dropping for a second straight session and driving the Dow below 17,000. 

 ""The advance has largely come on the back of strong data,"" said a Reuters report. Market participants are looking to earnings for confirmation that the economy recovered in the second quarter from the impact of a harsh winter, added the report. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 117.59 points or 0.69 percent, to 16,906.62. The S&P 500 slid 13.94 points or 0.70 percent, to 1,963.71. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 60.07 points or 1.35 percent, to 4,391.46. 

 Asian shares were trading lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was down 0.30 per cent at 15,269.50 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 1.3 per cent lower at 23,230.

Tracking the momentum, the index may reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8,800 in trade today. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 2.50 points higher at 8,811 indicating positive opening on the domestic market. 

 Indian markets ended the day on a positive note after witnessing a choppy trade through the trading session. The S&P BSE Sensex closed 177 points higher at 28,885.21, while Nifty ended 64 points up at 8778.30 on Thursday. 

 ""Nifty is likely to move in a broader range for some time. This will remain a bounce back with some kind of choppiness coming in, but overall direction or the swing should be on the upside,"" says Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com. 

 ""We kind of managed to get pass 8750 on Thursday, and the next targets would be at 8865, possibly even 8945-8950 on the upside - so we are looking at these two targets,"" he adds. 

 Another important point highlighted by analysts is the fact that Reliance Industries and couple of banking names are lending support. 

 Unless and until we see 8680 being taken out, the immediate bias still on the upside, but yes I do not see 8950 or 9000 being crossed so easily, concludes Thacker. 

 Nifty has surged past the immediate resistance zone around the 8720-8750 mark. 

 ""In continuation to our earlier trajectory, we may see higher levels in the range of 8850-8920 mark. The immediate support has now shifted higher at the 8720-8650 mark,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 Overnight, US stocks closed higher as crude oil rebounded off a sharp decline, while investors bet that companies would top lowered expectations this earnings season. 

 ""Equities have struggled for direction of late, with investors seeing limited upside potential in equities, but also few alternatives for yield. Many investors are looking ahead to the first-quarter earnings season for market guidance,"" Reuters reported. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.22 points, or 0.31 percent, to 17,958.73, the S&P 500 gained 9.29 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,091.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.74 points, or 0.48 percent, to 4,974.57. 

 Asian markets were trading higher on news that Greece had made a 450 million euro loan payment to the International Monetary Fund trimmed safety bids for U.S. government debt. 

 ""The payment to the IMF secured extra emergency lending for Greek banks and helped improve global risk sentiment, though it remained unclear whether Athens could satisfy creditors who remain skeptical on the country's economic reforms,"" added the Reuters report.

ET Now: What would be yourclosing thoughts for the day? 

 Ashwani Gujral: Well, some kind of momentum has picked up on the downside. Today was a right day to go short on this market and chances are that if we do get follow through, we should slowly head towards 5180-5150 levels and then may be 5100. Today we have closed at a very interesting point on the Bank Nifty because this trend line I keep talking about 4770 through 5050, today was tested around 5220. 

 So once 5220 gives up, then the entire rally we had from 4770 to about 5400, that ends and you start a downside move. It is often easierto move on the downside if global markets also participate. In case that starts,then it will be a bit easier to go down, but clearly metals, banks and most ofthese sectors at intermediate lows are likely to make fresh lows. 

 
ET Now: What is your call on the market? 

 Ashwani Gujral: While the Nifty has not given you that thrust that you need to get a decisive move in one direction. Bank Nifty has done that often, the parameter for that is about 1.5%, the Bank Nifty has done 1.5% downside. So, while Nifty is still kind of up and down, the Bank Nifty has given the clearer move so that is where the short trade can come into play. 

 We have cut long positions on the Nifty. So now you can easily keep a 10,050 type of a stop on Bank Nifty and play for some bigger downside to about 9550. So in that regard the short side you can play much better on the Bank Nifty, then on the Nifty itself. The breakdown level on Nifty was 5230, we went down 10 points below it. 

 Now we are couple of points above it, so that is not giving you that clear decisive move which can help you go short but clearly the upside bias on the Nifty is probably not there now. So on individual stocks JSPL is a sell with a stop of about 346, target of 325. JSW Steel is a sell with a stop of about 675, target of 630 and Zee Enterprise buy with a stop of about 165, target of 185."

The stock has fallen 50% since its listing in July 2009 and is now trading close to an all-time low.
 
 Many of its delayed projects, with aggregate capacity of close to 1372 MW, are likely to be commissioned in FY13 and FY14. Timely completion of these projects will be critical for the company to restore investor confidence.
 
 The company recently commissioned the 154 MW Chamera III plant, which was delayed by around two years. Many other projects of the company too are delayed, and two of its most profitable projects , the 800 MW Parbati II and 2000 MW Subansiri projects are behind schedule by over five years.
 
 The company expects to commission six of the delayed projects, with of a total capacity 1372 MW, in the next two years within a three-tosix months span. In FY13, the company expects to commission 1212 MW, or 24% of the current capacity of 5500 MW.
 
 Due to the high incidence of missing targets, most brokerages are highly skeptical about the company's ability to achieve the target. They are assuming only 40-60 % of project completion for their calculation of the company's future earnings estimates .
 
 According to them, the company's earnings are likely to grow only 2% in FY13. In the June quarter, NHPC's revenues fell 2.3% year-onyear to Rs 1,399 crore, while operating profit fell 10.4% to Rs 1,149 crore and net profit dipped 15.3% to Rs 670 crore.
 
 The rise in the company's debtors too is a concern. Its debtor position was Rs 2,100 crore at the end of the June quarter.
 
 Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Jharkhand account for two-thirds of the troubled debt. The company plans to recover this in installments with interest. Due to its lackluster performance in the past and slow execution, NHPC's stock is trading below its net worth or book value.

NCDEX mulls relaunch of Brent contract soon,"{""NCDEX"": ""neutral"", ""Brent"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/ncdex-mulls-relaunch-of-brent-contract-soon/articleshow/7415251.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,NCDEX mulls relaunch of Brent contract soon,"MUMBAI: National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) proposes to relaunch its illiquid Brent-benchmarked contract with some changes in the contract specifications. 
  
  At present, the bourse has a crude contract referenced to West Texas Intermediate contract that’s traded on New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex). The Brent contract is traded on InterContinental Exchange (ICE), which holds a 2.96% stake in NCDEX. 
  
  “We have recently applied to Forward Markets Commission (FMC) for a change in contract specs,” said R Ramaseshan, MD & CEO of NCDEX. “We propose to increase the tick size from Rs 0.50 to Rs 1.” A phone call and a text message to BC Khatua, chairman of FMC, to get the regulator’s response remained unanswered. 
  
  The tick size — the minimum price a contract can move up or down — is 50 paise currently. By doubling the tick size, both profit and loss of a trader will be doubly magnified. For example, if the minimum size of a crude contract is 100 barrels, the value of a tick in a contract with a tick size of 50 paise is Rs 50. This would increase to Rs 100 if tick size is doubled to Rs 1. 
  
  It remains to be seen if a change in tick size will result in liquidity rising, a market watcher said. “NCDEX may have launched Brent with a lower tick size to attract volumes but considering the contract has been illiquid, it may have decided to standardise it by bringing the tick size on a par with that of the WTI benchmarked contract,” said Krishna Nathani, MD of indiabullion.com, a Chennai-based commodity research firm. 
  
  The mainly farm-led trading bourse has been focussing on crude oil whose volumes have gone up after Delhi brokerage Jaypee Capital was inducted as NCDEX’s anchor investor in October last year.
  
  Upon becoming a stakeholder in a commex, regulatory norms require an entity to surrender membership of that bourse. Earlier, Mr Khatua told ET that Jaypee Capital’s Gaurav Arora had informed the regulator that he had surrendered directorship of Jaypee Commodities, a broking member of NCDEX. 
  
  FMC data for the fortnight ended January 15 show the value of crude oil futures trading on NCDEX was Rs 27,549 crore against Rs 80,422 crore by MCX which is the market leader in metals and energy trading. MCX also offers a Brent contract but trading is illiquid on it compared with its WTI contract.
  
  Of late, the Brent contract at over $100 a barrel has traded at a $10 premium to WTI due to local issues in the US which has seen supplies from Canada and a build-up of storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, said an oil trader at a PSU oil refining company."

 The increased profit is on account of increased margins in the products coming out of the secondary units in Phase III units, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) Chairman DK Saraff told reporters here. 

 The profit also increased on account of increase in the gap between the prices of crude oil and those of refined products during the first quarter 2015-16 as compared to the corresponding previous quarter, Saraff said. 

 The Company's refining throughput was 3.89 MMT as against 3.20 MMT in the corresponding quarter of previous year, Saraff said. 

 The GRM for the quarter was posted at $6.62/bbl as against $0.66 /bbl during the corresponding quarter, he added.

The unemployment rate also dipped to 6.1%, last seen six years ago. Treasuries are likely to fall on speculation that the US will raise interest rates faster than anticipated, with many leading institutions revising its rate increases to third quarter of 2015, citing better than expected job data. Market is likely to take its cues from the FOMC minutes due for release on Wednesday. Chinese trade data and inflation due this week will also affect prices in the near term.

The dollar has become stronger with the DXY Index ticking up to 80.33 after languishing at levels of 79.80 most of the previous week. Confirmation that the two export terminals in Libya are expected to open soon, added to the positive sentiment. Though the prices have slipped below the psychological 104 levels, the key will be the breaking of the next support at $103.50 levels. 
  Gold-: A stronger dollar continues to weigh on gold prices, with Gold breaking a key support level of $1316 to trade at $1314. However, the speculation on whether the Fed will actually change its timetable to raise interest rates earlier is likely to keep prices ranged till Wednesday, when the FOMC meeting minutes are to be released.Technically, having broken the $1316 level, the next support lies at $1305.50 and the resistance at $1330. With the safe haven factor evaporating, gold is likely to take its cues from dollar strength/ weakness in the coming weeks."

The dollar gained with the DXY upto 81.40 levels on a strong reading of the second quarter GDP coming in at 4% versus an expectation of 3% and against a previous reading of -2.1%. The Fed acknowledged the growth and continued with the wind down of its bond buying program with a tick down to $25 billion from $35 billion. For the first time, the Fed also acknowledged inflationary pressures, and reiterated that while it was comfortable with it?s the accomodative monetary stance, things could change if rapid improvement in the labor markets is seen.

The fall in Euro was due to improvement in US economy as the GDP numbers impressed the market participants which helped dollar to gain strength and as such Euro faltered. 	 		Euro lost momentum further as the CPI m/m data of Germany slowed down, raising questions whether the ECB?s recent measures are having the intended effect on the economy or not. 	 		Spanish flash CPI y/y dipped at -0.3% against 0.1% earlier indicating that ECB has to take further stringent measures to save the economy. However, flash GDP q/q came at 0.6% against 0.4%.

The overall trend is negative.  Other Markets   	 		India?s 10-year G-Sec -. Ten-year benchmark yield is quoting below par at 8.49% as RBI?s move to switch to multiple price auctions from uniform price auction seems to have spooked bond traders. Today there is a second auction for the ten year benchmark for Rs 9000 crores, which is also expected to be aggressively bid. The seven day repo auction for Rs 20,000 crore was completed yesterday at a cut off yield of 8.16%. Yesterday the RBI also conducted a 182 day and 91 day Tbill auctions of Rs 6000 crore and Rs 9000 crore at cut off yields of 8.64 and 8.70 respectively. RBI also conducted a one -day reverse repo of Rs 11,949 crores at a fixed rate of 7.00% and a one-day repo auction of Rs 18,061 crores at a fixed rate of 8.00% under the Liquid Adjustment Facility. 	 		US Treasury Market -: The Treasury markets took direction from the FOMC meeting minutes and a positive second quarter GDP which was up at 4.00% against a previous reading of -2.10%. The ten-year benchmark yield jumped 9.5 basis points to trade at 2.55% as investors considered a better than expected GDP and an inflation component in the GDP Report i.e. the PCE Index was up to 2.3%. The FOMC meeting minutes also acknowledged inflation and better growth, while maintaining its comfort with the wind down of the bond stimulus and the accommodative monetary stance for a considerable time. However the element of dissent was stronger and it seems probable that interest rate hikes could come sooner, especially if the labor market numbers continue to improve. 	 		Crude Oil-: WTI Crude oil moved back to trade at $ 99.13 below the psychological level of $ 100. While there was some pressure on account of sanctions on Russia, FOMC?s comments that the labor market slack was a matter of concern, reduced the impact of better US growth and the pressure on oil prices. The US Inventories Report also showed crude oil stocks dropped by 3.7 million barrels as against an expectation of a 1.5 million barrel drop, which for the most part was ignored by investors. Brent too is trading lower at $ 106 levels 	 		Gold-:. Gold dropped on the strong US GDP report to trade at $1292 before climbing back to trade at $ 1295 levels. The Fed?s reassessment of the US economy, which acknowledged growth and inflationary pressures, added salt to the wound. While geopolitical tensions both in Ukraine and Gaza should support prices, a strong DXY at 81.44 levels will exert pressure on Gold. Technically, gold is supported at $1287 with a resistance at $1314 levels."

Technically, Gold seems to be poised for an up move, as we have been indicating over the last week. (See our Graph of the day on July 8, 2014 and July 1, 2014)."

  The Indian Rupee opened flat on Tuesday but fell for the second consecutive day, closing down by 9 paise at 59.29 or 0.15% against dollar due to sustained demand by the importers for American currency. RBI intervention was seen in the afternoon as well as the demand for the dollar which had put pressure on Rupee.

During the month, the central bank purchased USD 7.85 billion from the market and it sold USD 1.98 billion, according to RBI data released today.

  The MET department forecasted yesterday that the monsoons will be below normal at 93% against the earlier forecast of 95% of the long term 50 year average which will slow down the agricultural GDP to near 0.8%. 
  Technically speaking, USD INR continues to trade in a tight range of 59.00-59.50. Traders can utilize this opportunity by buying rupee near 59.50 and selling it near 59 levels. While the prices persist within this range the Rupee is expected r to be range bound. A trending move can be seen only when one of the extremes of the range is taken out which will direct the further trend for Rupee. If rupee breaks the low of 59.50, then it can drag down further till 60.00 levels and if it moves above 59.00 levels then it can reach till 58.00 levels.

  ECB governing council member Erkki Liikanen stressed to support price stability and the economic recovery in the region and Jozef Makuch signalled that ECB may take further steps by cutting interest rate even as the measures taken in the last policy were insufficient which added pressure on Euro. 
  French industrial production rebounded 0.3% in April but business sentiment in the nation declined in May. Whereas the Italian Industrial production rose to 0.7% against -0.4%. The mixed euro zone data was also a reason for Euro to slump. 
  Further IMF warned the Greece Government that to achieve the nations fiscal targets, the efficiency of public sector need to be improved.

  India?s 10-year G-Sec -: Benchmark 10 year yield yesterday closed at 8.56% up by 0.20% from its previous day close. Today it is quoting at 8.58% up by 2 points. Experts came out of the view that it can come down to 8% by the year end as the 50bps reduction in SLR to 22.5% will only add to the excess liquidity lying with banks and may not lead to lower rates. It is, however, a signal that, RBI will provide liquidity if demand rises. Reduction in liquidity under ECR will be offset by the special term repo facility. RBI will further moderate its policy stance in the next meeting without reducing rates. For FY15, we expect rates to moderate by 50 bps and G-Sec yield is likely to be about 8% by fiscal end. RBI accepted 52 bids worth Rs. 184.22 billion under the Repo auction this morning. 
  US Treasury Market -: Treasuries sell off pushed yields on 10-year notes to the highest level in four weeks before the U.S. sells $21 billion of the securities today.

It reached a level of 2.66% overnight and has been stable at this level since then. 
  Crude Oil-: Crude oil prices rose Tuesday and crossed its previous high of $104.50 and it is now quoting at $104.48 was helped by higher than expected China inflation that bolstered the demand outlook for the commodity. However, with fundamentals unsupportive, its upward journey is likely to face stiff resistance even at the nearest target. As the twists and turns in the geopolitical scenario and monetary and currency conditions are unpredictable which can affect the crude oil prices. 
  Gold-: Gold settled above $1260 for the first time after 2 weeks due to weakness in equities yesterday as now investors will watch closely the data scheduled this week and getting s modest boost inflationary news coming from Europe and China.

In June, the multilateral agency had forecast growth at 4.7% for 2014.

Yields eased yesterday after the release of WPI numbers, inflation dipped sharply to a five- month low at 6.16 percent in December 2013. The moderation was mainly driven by a fall in vegetable prices. Strengthened expectations of no rate hike by central bank has also helped the yields. In current session, benchmark 10-year yields are trading at 8.62 percent. RBI also deferred bond auction scheduled for the current week supporting the sentiment for G-sec market.

U.S. Producer price index rose 0.4 percent in December. The data was in line with estimates. The increase was partly due to a rebound in energy prices, which surged 1.6 percent in December after falling 0.4 percent in November. In current session gold is trading at $ 1241 per ounce. Gold is expected to trade in thin range between 1225 and 1250 for sometime. A upward move cannot be expected unless we see a constant rise above $1250.

FED will possibly not raise the interest rate unless it winds down bond buying stimulus in this year. 
  While Charles Plosser think that FED should increase the interest rate by mid 2015 as FED is achieving its goals faster as unemployment could drop to 5.8% this year and inflation should move back to central bank?s 2% target.

Assessment of the current business situation remained good, but companies were less optimistic about future business developments as the worries of Iraq escalate. The fall in the IFO is a signal that the euro zone?s growth engine is slowing down and German businesses are quite unimpressed by measures taken by the European Central Bank.

  Indian stock markets have seen volatile trading all of the last week, with FII flows continuing to keep markets buoyant, even as investors mulled the contagion effect of an early interest rate in the US as well as lethargic off take of credit and slow exports and industrial production in the Asian region. For India, the problems are complicated by high inflation, which the IMF, in its note preceding the G20 meet has highlighted. The RBI thus has its hands tied in terms of easing interest rates to boost productivity, and is dependant on central government reform and foreign aid to boost productivity. Since the impact of both these is slow in coming, investors play a wait and watch game, even as cheap money flows continues to drive their search for yields.

  US stocks and bond yields eased substantially ahead of the earnings season and the FOMC Minutes due today.

He indicated that he saw no inflationary bias in the economy in the near term and believed inflation would come in at less than the Fed?s target of 2.00 per cent.

In UK too, there was an unusual dip in manufacturing and industrial productionwith manufacturing output falling 1.3% (mom) and industrial production falling 0.7%. 
  Asian Markets are all down as are Asian currencies, probably beaten down by the correction in the US stock markets and a dip in the Chinese CPI which came in at 2.3% vis a vis an expectation of 2.4% . In early trade, the Sensex is flat, with a 10 point gain and Nifty is trading at 7622 levels. 
  In domestic news, the Rail Budget, despite the reaction from stock markets, was analysed as having no adverse impact on the fiscal deficit, while increasing facilities and infrastructure available to the customer. However the proposals seemed very broad , with no indication of details and timelines of implementation. Credit Suisse indicated that since the options before the FM are so limited, it is possibly that the general budget too would strike a similar note and be either a dissapointment or a non event for stock markets. 
  Technically speaking, USDINR is facing the resistance of 60.00 levels as it opened today at 59.92 but failed to move above 60.00 levels. The major resistance comes to 60.20-60.25 where cluster of resistances are placed. The immediate support for this pair comes to 59.65 followed by 59.50 where the lower Bollinger band is placed.

In the last week, foreign funds have exhausted 51% of their limit to invest in Indian bonds. Corporate bond issues are also up with ONGC completing a $ 2 billion bond issue this week. However, the upcoming budget and the fiscal deficit target it lays down is likely to determine direction of yields in the near term The RBI completed auctions of 4/5/ 10 year state development loans of nine state governments of Rs 8500 crore at cut yields ranging from 8.90 ? 9.00% yesterday.

Uncertainty increased in global markets as the implications of the move are still unclear to the global investor, with no clarity from either the British or the Scottish government on a new currency versus the pound, the impact of the same on those holding Scottish assets. 	 		In domestic news, economic data releases due this week are likely to be keenly watched by investors. August IIP is expected to come in weaker at 0.8% yoy down from 3.4% in July mainly on account of unfavorable base effect and moderation in core industries. This is likely to continue into September if no solution is found for the coal crisis. The Supreme Court is expected to take a decision on the fate of coal block allocations which it declared illegal earlier and decide a course of action. The government of India has suggested a middle path of sparing some of the 42 of illegal coal block allocations but it remains to be seen whether this will be accepted by the Supreme Court.

Further, Richmond manufacturing index marked at 14 against 12 earlier which rise to 3 year high indicating that manufacturing is doing well.

Equities globally were weaker yesterday as investors mulled slowing growth in the Eurozone and China as well as an uptick in geopolitical tensions with Israel striking down a Syrian warplane and the expanding airstrikes in the region by US and its allies. In early trade, the Sensex is up by 21 points and the Nifty up by six points at 8023. Rupee likely to trade in a range of 60.80- 61.20 levels. 	 		The India story still has got a lot of appeal for foreign investors says the IFC, the World bank?s private sector arm who are in talks with Indian regulators to sell another $2 million of rupee denominated bonds to overseas investors. The company had launched $1 billion fund last year which saw a strong response. Earlier this year it had raised another $100 million through the issue of rupee denominated bonds available to both domestic and foreign investors. 	 		Perhaps this positive sentiment is also reflected by the yields of the 10 year GOI Bonds which have fallen to its lowest level of 8.44% in the last two months. In addition to an easing of inflationary pressures (a lower CPI and WPI) the CAD target is looking increasingly reachable for the government. Additionally the Government is continuing its repurchase program making an announcement to repurchase Rs 8000 crores of securities. 	 		The Supreme Court will meet today to take a final call on the coal allocations.

The composite PMI for Europe came in 52.3, a nine month low, as Germany and France, two of the biggest economies struggled to keep its PMI?s above the contraction level. The US bond markets too have slashed expectations of future inflation to their lowest levels in three years.

  After a long weekend the local unit opened stronger at 59.81 levels after closing last week at 59.89 levels. The range for the Indian Rupee is seen between 59.60?60.10 levels. 
  The Indian rupee posted its biggest quarterly gain since the September quarter of 2012 as heavy foreign buying of equities and debt boosted the local unit, but further gains could be capped by a cautious central bank. 
  The rupee also breached the 60-per-dollar mark for the first time in eight months, prompting the central bank to start building up their reserves. Some traders speculated the central bank has likely bought nearly $2-$3 billion over this week in its attempt to slow the rupee's rally. 
  Foreign funds have purchased a net $3.7 billion in equities from the start of 2014 until March 27 while in debt the net inflows stand at $5.8 billion. 
  The one-year onshore forward premium rose to 519 points, not far from its record high of 525.25 points as the central bank likely conducted sell buy swaps in the forward as per the traders. 
  With elections looming and an uncertain economic growth outlook, the Reserve Bank of India left interest rates on hold on Tuesday, as expected, and indicated it will keep rates steady in the near term if inflation eases towards the bank's targeted level. 
  But in a move to impose more discipline on lenders and in line with global practice, the central bank cut the amount of overnight funding it makes available to banks, nudging them to use longer-term funding in a push to deepen financial markets. 
  RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan warned of risks that inflation could rise even as risks to economic growth are to the downside.? If electoral outcomes fail to provide a stable government, the downside risks to growth could accentuate,"" the RBI said in a report accompanying its policy statement. 
  India's election commission on Tuesday allowed the Reserve Bank of India to announce new bank licenses even ahead of general elections set to conclude next month, according to a notice in the commission's website. This move would further add to the positive sentiment in the local equity market too. 
  Reserve Bank of India will remove pricing restriction on entry and exit of foreign direct investment (FDI). The central bank says it would like to move to market practices, operating guidelines will be issued soon. This is one of the biggest announcements by the RBI yesterday but markets have been preoccupied with the monetary policy statement. 
  Till now India has always wished control on how foreign investors will enter or exit India in terms of pricing and now the RBI is taking a far more mature view saying look we are going to leave it up to market players. As of now, no major details are announced. The statement seems to be positive to remove the 
  restriction on foreign players, but again we have to wait for further clarifications and details on the same. 
  The Asian markets are trading higher after an increase in U.S. manufacturing boosted optimism about growth in the world?s biggest economy. 
  Trading would be cautious, ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank and Friday's U.S. jobs numbers, both of which could move markets in major ways. 
  Investors have also been speculating that the European Central Bank would soon take further steps to loosen policy, though officials are blowing hot and cold on the issue. 
  On Tuesday, ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio told a news conference that low inflation was a concern and could drag on economic growth. Euro zone inflation slowed to an annual 0.5 percent in March, it?s lowest since November 2009. 
  But Constancio then went on to deny any risk of deflation, saying inflation was set to pick up. That was taken as diminishing the chance of an easing at the ECB's policy meeting on Thursday and gave the euro a modest lift. 
  Rupee gains to 59.80 ? 59.70 levels, which is again a strong support zone, where we can see some buyers emerging. The weekly close below 59.70 levels is very important, if it manages to close above it then we can see 59.00 levels too. But a weak weekly close above 60.00 could provide opportunity for the exporters to sell. Exporters as said earlier keep selling on upticks.

  The euro bounced back against the U.S. dollar even as softer-than-forecast inflation numbers added to the discussion of whether the European Central Bank will cut interest rates when it meets on Thursday. 
  The data initially supported expectations that ECB could act to counter the deflationary threat as early as this week. But many investors expect the ECB will keep monetary policy unchanged. 
  The gains in euro over past 3 days have been modest. The problem is not underlying weakness in recent reports but rather an overall skepticism about how much impact these stronger numbers will have on the European Central Bank's economic outlook and monetary policy bias. 
  Due to dip in Germany's jobless rate and their larger than anticipated decline in unemployment rolls, the euro extended its gains against the U.S. dollar. 
  The positive surprises in German data are relatively new and have yet to cause investors to forget about last month's disappointments. Inflation remains extremely low making it impossible for the ECB to considering reducing stimulus at this time. 
  Positive sentiment for the Euro was also fuelled after the ECB Vice President, Vitor Constancio projected inflation rate in the region to bounce back in April, following a fall to 0.5% in March. Furthermore, he indicated that he did not see deflation prospects in the Euro-zone but at the same time warned that the economy could face a protracted period of low inflation, which could act as a drag on the region's economic recovery.

  India is prepared for potential financial fallout if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates before April 2015, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said yesterday in Washington. ¡§Nobody is prepared for every eventuality,but for most eventualities, we are prepared,¡¨ Rajan said in an interview with Bloomberg News after an event in Washington. ¡§For us, the specific timing matters less than that it should happen when U.S. growth is strong.

  The Indian rupee opened weaker at 60.35 levels after closing last week at 60.17 levels.The range for the day is seen between 60.20 ? 60.80 levels. 
  The Indian rupee posted its second consecutive weekly fall after data showed the trade deficit widened to a five-month high in March. The data reflected that the trade deficit inched up to $10.5 billion from $8.13 billion in February on the back of falling exports. The data again revived concerns about the current account deficit after a recent sharp narrowing. 
  Investors will now be closely eying the consumer inflation data due on today, as well as the start of corporate earnings results next week, for a better snapshot of the domestic economy. The government will release the data on wholesale prices on Tuesday around 0630 GMT. Consumer price data is due at 1200 GMT. 
  Inflation in India is expected to have edged up on higher food costs in March, snapping a three-month easing trend that will give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) less scope to support the economy amid fresh signs of slowdown. Analysts say the risk of less-than-normal monsoon rains this summer will call into question assumptions that the worst is over for Asia's third-largest economy. 
  The other big news is from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology last week predicted that the chance of an El Nino weather event developing in 2014 now exceeded 70 percent. According to the reports, a strong El Nino in India would trigger lower production of summer crops such as rice, sugarcane and oilseeds. In 2009, it had turned monsoon rains patchy, leading to the worst drought in nearly four decades which shot up annual food inflation to over 21 percent. 
  Such a scenario would further compound the challenges for the new government that takes over in New Delhi after national elections in May. 
  The Asian markets are trading mixed after upbeat U.S. data helped Wall Street bounce from a sharp selloff in recent days, though tensions in Ukraine tempered demand for riskier assets. 
  The encouraging retail sales from the world's biggest economy, which had been bogged down by a harsh winter, gave some respite to the investors. The dollar held steady after the solid U.S. retail sales data. The euro remained under pressure on weekend comments from European Central Bank officials, including ECB President Mario Draghi, who rekindled speculation about more easing in the euro zone. 
  Dollar Rupee is trading above 60.20 levels, a break above 60.40 levels on a consistent note could produce a fast rally towards 60.80 - 61.00 levels.

  The Euro is trading lower at 1.3816 levels after mixed sentiment seen arising over the pair. 
  The European policymakers putting downside pressure on the pair and the recent decline in U.S. yields providing upside support. Both of these forces are strong and significant enough to keep EUR/USD confined within a 1.36 to 1.40 trading range. 
  Based on the comments from ECB officials, European policymakers do not want to see the EUR/USD trade above 1.40 and if it gets there, the chance of ECB easing will skyrocket. 
  The central bank may not be serious about Quantitative Easing but they are very serious about talking down their currency. In fact Mario Draghi's comment that ""the strengthening of the exchange rate requires further monetary stimulus"" is one of the central bank's strongest warnings against a rising currency. 
  The policymakers have made it clear that QE is an option in theory, in reality they have a number of ways to ease monetary policy including a reduction in the refi or deposit rate, narrowing the interest rate corridor. If the currency pair resumes its rise above 1.39, we see an 80% chance of more stimulus in June.

  Sterling fell for three consecutive sessions but yesterday it managed to close almost at par with opening level of 1.3726. Despite positive economic report, the currency tends to react from global markets which were prone for risk aversion due to Ukraine tensions. 
  The only economic report on the docket was housing price index which soars to record levels indicating the healthy sign for the sector. 
  The strong housing sector and positive signal from other economic reports shows the economy is gaining momentum compare to last year where it was drowning in recession. 
  This shows that the central bank may consider starting tightening the policy rates, however so far they remained dovish since the inflation and wage prices are still under pressure. 
  In previous month, wage prices were at minimal and inflation below the target level which if continued will defer the policy tightening by the central bank, thus correction in the pair will remain imminent. 
  Apart from CPI, there are other secondary data are set to release which will also incorporate the trend of currency by traders. 
  GBPUSD: The Sterling traded within tight range of 47 pips in yesterday?s session before closing the day unchanged at 1.6726, thus forming Doji. The price has fall for three consecutive sessions and if today it close in red will continue the pattern of deceleration while keeping upside limited at 1.6750.

  The local unit opened significantly lower at 60.73, versus close of 60.55 yesterday.

The rupee is likely to trade with a weak bias between 60.40 ? 61.00 levels. 
  US equity markets went into a tailspin probably on market interpretation of Fed?s statements acknowledging inflation combined with the strong numbers on Q2 GDP. The market has interpreted this as a strong possibility that rate hikes could happen earlier, especially if the slack in the labor market were to improve. However ADP Employment numbers on Wednesday came in lower than expectation at 2, 15,000. Yesterday, the four week average of jobless claims dropped to 2, 97,250, the lowest since April 2006. Today?s number on non farm payroll will be crucial determine whether data is consensus with the Fed?s view that the slack still exists in the labor market.

On economic front Halifax HPI m/m was released yesterday marking at 1.4% against -0.4% earlier. It is measured by change in prices of house financed by Halifax Bank of Scotland. It's a leading indicator of the housing industry's health because rising house prices attract investors and spur industry activity. 	 		Manufacturing Production m/m registered at 0.3% against -1.3%, but was well below the market expectations of 0.7% which added pressure on Pound making it weak against dollar. Manufacturing production is a leading indicator of economic health as production reacts quickly to ups and downs in the business cycle and is correlated with consumer conditions such as employment levels and earning. 	 		Industrial production m/m marked at 0.3% against -0.6% but was not in line with the expectations of 0.6%. The report adds to signs some areas of the recovery are softening, with manufacturers battling a stronger pound and strains in the euro area. 	 		NIESR GDP estimate came at 0.6% against 0.8% earlier. This implies an annual rate of growth of around 3 per cent. While the economy regained its pre-recession size recently, a significant negative output gap remains. NIER is change in the estimated value of all goods and services produced by the economy during the previous 3 months. 	 		The FTSE yesterday was in a negative territory mirroring the negative global cues. The index was down by 0.70% and closed at 6636 levels but is slightly up today morning. 	 		Later today, Asset Purchase Facility, Official Bank Rate and MPC Rate Statement is expected to be released. Pound is expected to take cues from it.  GBP/USD: The pair continues to make a lower high and lower low formation which clearly suggests that the trend is negative. Any bounce in this pair will be temporary and it will then start its downtrend again. The pair can test the level of 1.6800 levels and the resistance comes to 1.6880 levels.  Other Markets   	 		India?s 10-year G-Sec -..Ten-year benchmark yield is steady at 8.62%, as rupee hit a five month low at 61.50 yesterday. In addition, Governor Rajan?s statement that the fiscal deficit of 4.1% in 2015, would be a difficult ask, is likely to support a higher yield. RBI completed a Rs 6000 crore auction of 364 day T bills and Rs 9000 crore auction of 91 day T bills at cut off yields of 8.74% and 8.64%.They also conducted a one -day reverse repo of Rs 2167 crores at a fixed rate of 7.00% and a one-day repo auction of Rs 20145 crores at a fixed rate of 8.00% under the Liquid Adjustment Facility. 	 		US Treasury Market -. Yields fell sharply with the ten year benchmark dropping to 2.43% before finally settling at 2.46% as tensions about Ukraine and Russian defiance in face of stringent sanctions, weighed on the markets. Though analysts agree that the possibility of an actual invasion of Ukraine is low, the sentiment remains risk averse with all safe haven assets showing a tick up, including bond yields across global markets. While data on US markets have been positive, with the trade deficit narrowing to 7%, the lowest since Jan 2014, investors are currently ignoring US growth and focusing on developments in Ukraine. 	 		Crude Oil-:..WTI Crude ticked down to $ 96.94 levels after ticking up slightly to $ 97.95 levels on geopolitical tensions and a general risk off sentiment. However today, the excess supplies is playing on the price, with the inventories report released by Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing that the stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma have gone to 18.0 million barrels, despite a draw down of 1.8 million barrels. Earlier in the week, the American Petroleum Institute in its report yesterday showed that the stocks were lower by 5.5 million barrels which was positive for prices. Brent too was trading at a 13 month low of $ 104.07 at yesterday. 	 		Gold-: Gold convincingly broke through the psychological level of $ 1300 to trade steady at $ 1306 on safe haven trade as concerns on Ukraine kept global stock markets pressured. Gold rose along with other safe haven trades such as yen and global bond yields. Prices are likely to be steady till the ECB and BOE meetings today. Technically, $ 1297 remains a strong support with some resistance seen at $ 1310."

  India?s 10-year G-Sec-: Government bonds gained for a third consecutive session on Tuesday to a more than one-week high, as strong demand at the government's auction of mobile airwaves is improving confidence about the country's finances. The benchmark yield dropped by 7 bps to the day?s low of 8.67 percent yesterday. The government is scheduled to sell 100 billion rupees ($1.60 billion) worth of bonds on Friday, potentially the last debt sale in the current financial year as the government has received higher-than-budgeted revenues through small savings. In the current session the yield is trading at 8.71 percent. As far as liquidity is concerned, a total of 27 banks bid for a total of Rs. 20947 crores today. 
  US Treasury Market -: Rebound in risk appetite aided bond yields to gain from three month lows with 10 year bond yield upped by 5 bps to 2.63 percent. Investors are bracing for job report schedule later this week, after poor manufacturing report is blamed for recent economic weakness. And any poor number will shift the Fed stance from withdraw of QE. Also, the government is most likely to reinstate the limit on borrowing later this week as they could use accounting measures to do the same till end of the month. In the meantime, issuance of short term debt is been restricted which might add pressure to the bills that are most at risk of delayed payments. Thus mix of events could keep cautious investors to take a call before entering into the market. 
  Crude Oil-: WTI Oil price remain steady with a firm note at $97.70 as US is gripped with cold bolstering the demand for fuel. Also, recovery in equities is supporting the prices. But Brent oil remained lower on concerns over recovery in emerging markets. Inventory data is lined up today, where it is expected to print lower which shows that stronger demand in the world?s biggest economy. While on supply it has eased the delivery has been eased from Gulf coast as well as the start-up of TransCanada?s Keystone south pipeline which should even out supply demand balance overall in near term. 
  Gold-: The week was astounding to gain by more than a percent; however recovery in equities and dollar strength has capped further upside for Gold. Today, the price fell for second day but trading in tight range of $4 amid weak demand from Asian markets as the Chinese markets are shut for the Lunar New Year holiday which weighed on volumes. Earlier the gains in the price were due to weaker data from US, nevertheless the price has added nearly 5 percent since start of 2014. The top buyer, China has been weak on physical front on New Year which has kept the price in range bound. NFP the barometer of US remains watchful to define the price in near term."

  The continued buying pressures make the local unit to break the range. It opened at 62.35 levels after closing at 62.26 levels. 
  The Indian rupee fell to a two-week low yesterday, posting a second consecutive decline, hurt by the biggest falls in stocks in six weeks and dollar demand from a large corporate. The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index PMI fell to 50.7 in December from 51.3 in the previous month.  
  The weak start to the year comes ahead of key events later this month, including inflation data due mid-month that will help determine whether the Reserve Bank of India raises interest rates at its policy review on Jan. 28. 
  The RBI has made clear it could resume tightening monetary policy after two rate hikes last year even as economic growth slows. Good and consistent demand from state-run banks may be on account of genuine oil demand, and a fall in equities also exerted pressure on the local unit. 
  The dollar index regaining the strength could take rupee under some pressure, it is trading steady near a two-week high after positive U.S. economic data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to step away from its bond buying stimulus. 
  The US 10 year bond yields have risen above psychologically important 3% and there is nearly a consensus on long-term interest rates in US to rise further this year. This should attract investors to dollar bonds thus strengthening US Dollar in 2014. 
  The Yield differential has been a major driver for currencies historically and a recent spike in US yield lead to a huge outflows from Indian Debt market. If the trend continues the local debt market could again come under pressure again hurting the local unit. Accordingly, one should closely watch the movements in US bond yields and in US Dollar; we expect rise in both in coming months. Further, there are instances of dollar strengthening in the first half of the year. This is specially driven by optimism about US growth outpacing growth elsewhere; hence money pulls back to homeland. 
  In the chart below, except in 2011, US dollar has strengthened in the first half. We expect US Dollar index to try 85 levels by mid of the year.. This also means that Rupee, which has benefited from FCNR swap flows till last Dec end, could come under pressure as well. Along with we also have short term debt of USD 173 billion maturing in March 2014.  
 USDINR: Technically, USDINR still waits for a major break out, which could be concluded on a consistent move. The days closing would hint for the coming week a weekly closing above 62.35 levels would limit the gains seen earlier, a closing below it will still open the doors for 62.00 below levels.

  The U.S. dollar eased from a seven-week high early on Friday as investors booked some profits ahead of the keenly awaited U.S. jobs report, helping lift the euro that was briefly unsettled by dovish comments from the European Central Bank. 
  The main takeaway from European Central Bank meeting is that low inflation and the volatility in money market rates are becoming a bigger headache for the central bank.  
  While the ECB left interest rates unchanged, the euro sold off when central bank President Draghi said they strengthened their forward guidance. In addition to saying that ""interest rates will remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,"" Draghi warned that they would ""act if the inflation outlook worsened"" or ""money markets tightened."" 
  However the currency pair bounced off its lows after investors realized that the central bank has grown more serious about dropping interest rates below zero. Draghi said all policy tools are at their disposal and they stand ready to act if needed but right now they are comfortable with the current level of monetary policy.  
 USDINR: In daily chart the 11 day EMA is seen crossing from above the 55 day EMA, in case the cross over completes and move towards to cross 21 day EMA then we can see a strong selling coming in.

  The Indian Rupee opened slight weaker at 61.67 levels after closing at 61.53 levels on Monday. The intraday range is seen between 61.40 ? 61.75 levels. 
  The local unit rose to its highest level in over a month on Monday, boosted by hefty gains in domestic shares and after weaker than-expected U.S. jobs data eased worries about an aggressive reduction in the Federal Reserve's stimulus. 
  The local unit rosed to 61.41 during the session, it?s strongest since Dec. 11. The unit rose 0.55 percent on day, its biggest single-day gain since Dec. 16. 
  India's retail inflation (CPI) in December eased to a three-month low as vegetable prices fell, giving some relief to policymakers struggling to contain price pressures as growth hovers at a decade low. Retail prices rose an annual 9.87 percent last month, slower than the 9.92 percent expected by economists. 
  The moderation was largely driven by a fall in vegetable prices, which cooled nearly 19 percent from November on improved supplies. That helped slow down annual food inflation to 12.16 percent last month from 14.72 percent in November 
  India will release December's wholesale price index-based inflation data a day later on January 15. 
  A fall in inflation could raise expectations the Reserve Bank of India would keep monetary policy on hold for a second consecutive month on Jan. 28 after data on Friday showed a surprise fall in industrial output. 
  With economic data, the foreign fund flows into the domestic share market will continue to be key for the rupee's fortunes. 
  With some improvement seen in the economy, the current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to decline by over 40% for fiscal 2013-14. Trade deficit that is down over 20% on the back of rising exports and falling imports is helping the CAD come off. Falling CAD is positive for the rupee that has gained 10% from lows against the dollar. 
  The Reserve Bank of India decided to grant more flexibility for hedging foreign exchange exposures, by relaxing rules for cancellation and rebooking forward contracts. 
  In a notification on Monday, the central bank said that it would allow forward contracts in respect of all current account transactions as well as capital account transactions with a residual maturity of one year or less to be freely cancelled anrebooked. 
  The forward contracts booked by FIIs/QFIs/other portfolio investors that were once cancelled could be rebooked up to the extent of 10% of the value of the contracts cancelled. However, the forward contracts booked by these investors may be rolled over on or before maturity. 
  Previous rules had prohibited the facility of cancellation and rebooking for forward contracts, involving rupee as one of the currencies, booked by residents to hedge current and capital account transactions. 
  Earlier, the exporters were allowed to cancel and rebook forward contracts up to 50% of the contracts booked in a financial year for hedging their contracted export exposures, whereas importers could cancel and rebook forward contracts not exceeding 25% of the contracts booked in a financial year. 
 USD/INR: With VIX continues to drop down, the volatility would be in control for a while. As mentioned earlier, upticks should be seen to sell for exporters while importers should not go aggressive for buying, partial buying on key support area makes sense. Looking further there are chances of rupee retesting the previous low of 61.10 or below levels. It?s the retracement level of the previous major rally from 55 ? 68.85 levels. Market was seen taking support from the same levels, if market breaks these levels on a consistent note then we can see a fair rally of rupee appreciation.

Negative sentiment was also fuelled after one of the leading broking houses slashed its 2014 gold price forecast by 14.7% to $1,141 per ounce and for 2015, by 17 percent to $1,100 per ounce. In the current session, the yellow metal is trading lower at $1241 ahead of the key US data. Technically, gold is expected to find it?s first support at $1234, and a fall through could take it to the next support level of $1228. On the flip side, immediate resistance will be seen at $1251, and breach of the same can take it to $1261 levels."

  The Indian Rupee opened at 62.12 levels after closing yesterday at 62.03 levels. The Euro fell to 1, 3727 levels and dollar index gained to 80.14 from 79.80 last night. The Rupee is to remain in a range of 61.80 to 62.40 for the day and upticks on the $ are to be sold. 
  The Indian rupee fell the most in nearly two weeks on Monday after data showed India's economy grew slower than expected and as military tensions in Ukraine hit emerging market assets, sending domestic shares lower. 
  Any renaissance in global risk aversion threatens to reverse strong dollar inflows into local stocks and debt markets, which totaled over $2 billion in February, and helped to push the local unit to its highest level in more than a month on Friday. 
  Indian manufacturing activity and new orders showed their strongest growth in a year in February, according to a survey released on Monday that suggested that the worst is over for Indian factories struggling through an economic slowdown. 
  The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which gauges the business activity of India's factories but not its utilities, rose to 52.5 in February; it?s highest in a year, from 51.4 in January. 
  Overall new orders for factory goods, which rose to a one-year high of 54.9 contributed to the surge. Export orders climbed to their highest in eight months. 
  The Asian stocks are trading mixed, after the regional index yesterday capped its first back-to-back declines in a month, as investors weighed the crisis in Crimea and ahead of the National People?s Congress annual meeting in China starting tomorrow. 
  In China, the National People?s Congress annual meeting begins tomorrow. The latest meeting of the legislature, the first to be overseen by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, comes as leaders pledge to give markets a ?decisive? role in the economy. 
  Investors will be watching the NPC meeting for clues to the next steps to fix local-government finances, charge market prices for natural resources, rein in shadow-banking risks, free up deposit rates and open up state businesses to private investment. 
  The Ukraine issue would hit the Europe most because Europe is more economically reliant on Russia than the U.S. Commodities were hit hard with wheat prices rising 4.8% to its highest level in more than 2 months, corn prices rose 1.5% to its highest level since September. As Ukraine is one of the world's largest exporters of corn and wheat, these increases should not be surprising. If supplies are halted for any reason, prices will rise even further. We have also seen a significant rally in the price of crude oil, which climbed to its strongest level in 5 months and gold, which is at a 4 month high. 
  USDINR got the support at 61.80 levels and is seen inching higher, a sustained move above 62.20 levels would push it towards 62.45 ? 62.50 levels. Exporters have a keen eye and keep selling partially on the rallies seen. Importers were asked to buy on dips below 62.00 levels.

  The Indian Rupee opened weaker at 61.41 levels after closing yesterday at 61.17 levels. The range for the day is seen between 61.20 ? 61.65 levels. 
  The Indian rupee rose slightly yesterday, snapping a two-day losing streak, as a sharper-than-expected fall in retail inflation and a slight expansion in industrial output reinforced optimism the domestic economy was on the mend. Still, broader gains were capped as much of the positive news is seen to be priced in, given the rupee is trading at around seven-month highs, while traders preferred to wait and watch ahead of wholesale price inflation data, due on Friday. 
  The FII?s flows have been quite robust in last few sessions totaling the net inflow to more than USD 7 billion. The Foreign investors have bought net USD 1.08 billion and USD 5.98 billion in debt till year. 
  India imported about 36 percent less oil from Iran in February than in January, because of efforts to meet U.S. requests to restrict purchases from Tehran to 195,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the six months to July 20, data from trade sources showed. 
  The Asian stocks are trading lower as heightened tension in Ukraine ahead of a weekend referendum prompted investors to shed riskier assets. Safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc and the yen are in demand having surged overnight as tensions in Ukraine flared up and worries about the health of the Chinese economy continued to fester. 
  It fell with a regional gauge set for the biggest weekly slump since June, gold climbed and copper fluctuated on concern China?s economy is faltering. Along with the slowdown in China and uncertainty in the Ukraine contributed to the liquidation and profit taking. There is also no coincidence that the rally in stocks stalled near record highs and the rally in EUR/USD stopped at a very significant technical resistance level. 
  The US central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering.So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases. Thankfully reducing stimulus won't be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. 
  Expectations for a continued normalization of monetary policy should limit losses for the greenback. Producer prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey is scheduled for release today and based on yesterday's economic reports, we expect slightly stronger numbers. 
  The Rupee is trading weaker on account of global concern. It is also seen sustaining above 61.00 levels and a weekly close above it could make it to inch up higher around 61.70 - 61.90 levels. Exporters should sell for next few weeks on the upticks seen and importers keeping on up-ticks or at stop losses.

  No major top story from financial market has helped sentiment to continue for dollar strengthening across the board. The recent rally is largely attributed to fall in major currencies since their respective bond yields decline, thus weighing back towards dollar for higher return. 
  Dollar index marked 4 week high of 80.58 to end again near the days high at 80.55. Sterling declined sharply by nearly 100 pips, with lower yields weighed USDJPY, Euro marked 3 ½ month low, commodity currencies stayed lower and Gold made another fresh three month low. 
  Globally, the volumes have fallen sharply in forex market with volatility halving as investors are yet unable to get clear indication of the central bank policy actions. 
  Speaking of equities, the indices hit new record high in yesterday?s session but later it lost its momentum to end the day in negative territory. Dow closed lower by 0.25%, S&P fell from the record high but managed to stay above the psychological level of 1900 at 1909.76 and Nasdaq ended down at 4225.07. 
  Today bout of economic reports are set to release such as revisions to Q1 GDP, jobless claims and pending home sales and another positive numbers could certainly drive dollar higher but any softness will keep both yields and dollar lower.

  Asian indices are trading mixed ahead of series of economic reports from the largest economy, plus tensions between China and Vietnam on border dispute has shed investors to stay away from riskier assets. Dollar across the board is marginally higher across the board, however it has not impacted much on Indian rupee so far.

  Surprisingly, Dollar rallied across the board even though Federal Reserve did not alter the monetary policy with minor change in statement and further few economic numbers too came out but they were not that encouraging. Dollar gained with the index marking high of 79.90 levels, bond yields too surged and equities sold off. 
  The winning streak for the US bourses ended yesterday as negative reaction weighed on markets after Fed decided to hold on the asset purchase program; however the selling pressure in equities were largely subdued. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 ended the session lower by 0.39% and 0.49% while the NASDAQ plunged 0.55%. 
  The FOMC maintained its current asset purchase program unchanged and holding funds target was held in the 0.00% to 0.25% range. The Fed will continue purchasing Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. 
  However, the key surprise element was the upbeat assessment of the economy from the central bank. The statement said that though the unemployment rate remains elevated and numbers coming are not satisfactory, they feel that conditions in all districts have improved. The committee reiterated that though inflation is persistently below its 2% target it will move back toward its target level over the medium term. More or less the tone was similar to previous meeting hence financial markets did not respond accordingly. 
  The other data releases included the release of ADP employment report that showed the private sector added 130K jobs in October, missing forecasts for 150K. Small industries have remained major contributor to employment figures in recent times with dip in their figures future outlook for employment looks less optimistic. The consumer prices (CPI) rose 0.2% in September because of higher costs of medical care, shelter and all forms of fuel. The core CPI rose a modest 0.1%. 
  The Asian equities have staged declines taking cues from its western counterparts. The Hang Seng has dropped 0.47% while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.61% along with KOSPI that plummeted 1.43%. The Nikkei is trading lower at 1.20%. 
  Further directions in the dollar index for today will depend on Federal Budget Balance, Treasury Sec Lew, Weekly Unemployment Claims and speech from Treasury Secretary Lew.

  The Rupee gave a weaker opening at 61.36 levels compared to yesterday?s close of 61.23 levels tracking broad based dollar strength in the markets and losses in some of its Asian currency peers as FED kept the tap of Bond buying programme open and did not comment as to when they would commence the tapering.

  On a separate note, the Kirit Parikh panel's report on pricing of petroleum products has recommended to immediately hike prices of diesel by Rs 5 a litre, kerosene by Rs 4 per litre and cooking gas by Rs 250 per cylinder. However, the implementation of the recommendation is unlikely immediately due to general elections ahead. 
  After two rate hikes in less than six weeks aimed at curbing inflation, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said the central bank may be done with interest rate increases as their impact on the economy is assessed. ?We think we have done enough (on rate hikes) given what we know about the economy to wait and watch and see what happens,? Rajan told analysts in a customary post policy conference call. 
  On the rupee, Rajan said he would consider the local currency to be stable only when dollar demand from oil companies returns to the market. Oil companies currently have a special swap window provided by the central bank to meet their dollar requirements, a facility that Rajan said would be tapered gradually.

  On a positive side, Spain ended its two-year recession with 0.1% growth in the July-to-September period from negative 0.1% previously supported by increasing number of exports that lifted growth, with a boost to the tourist industry.

  Crude Oil-: WTI Crude Oil is trading lower by 0.09% to $96.68 levels in today?s session. WTI Crude has been on a downward spiral journey since October and has plunged from $101 to $96 in this month. The fall is largely attributed to the rise in crude oil inventories which gained for a sixth week in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer. Crude inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels to 383.9 million last week, data from the Energy Information Administration yesterday surpassing expectations of a climb by 2.4 million. Adding to the negative sentiment was that Libya will resume oil production on one of its biggest oil fields by next week. 
  Gold-: The yellow metal lost its sheen in the previous session and is currently trading lower by 0.58% at $1336 levels after the Fed decided to maintain the stimulus package. The policy statement was also accommodative and shoved the tapering concerns to next year. The prices in the previous session plunged to $1334 levels due to profit booking. Meanwhile, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive session yesterday, thereby limiting the losses."

  Dearth of data releases from the US economy left the markets looking on for clues from the Fed officials for hints about the timing of tapering the QE programme. Though the Euro stayed in the 1.34 range in gained modestly, while the commodity currencies extended their losses. The dollar index continued to trade in narrow range of 46 points. 
  The US indices ended the five week winning streak and posted modest losses. S&P500 led the losses in the bourses by shedding 0.24% while the DJIA edged lower by 0.21%. NASDAQ was unchanged at 0.00%, respectively. 
  Fed officials Lockhart and Fisher seemed to adopt a moderately hawkish stance as the former stated that the central bank could begin the taper at its December meeting although he did say policy should remain very easy while the latter said the QE cannot continue forever. Contradicting to the above, Kocherlakota supported the Fed in maintaining the accommodative policy. Overall, the comments proved to be puzzling the markets over the timing of the tapering due to diverging views from the officials. 
  The most watched out Third Plenum meeting in China disappointed the market as the meeting was short on specifics that left the investors clinging onto loose ends. 
  Though China?s leaders pledged to enact fiscal and land reform, relax investment controls and let the market play a ?decisive? role in allocating resources. They also said the Communist Party's hand needs to stay strong. Instead of giving a clear direction for the economy the party signalled a difficult road ahead for economic reforms. 
  The Asian bourses plunged in today?s session taking cues from the Chinese reforms. The Nikkei fell 0.38% followed by KOSPI that dropped 1.28% while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.88%. The Hang Seng has shed 1.39%.

  On the domestic front, both the CPI and the IIP releases disappointed the markets. The IIP data September printed 2% YoY below the expectations of 3.5% YoY although it came higher than the previous month's release of 0.6%. Within the IIP, the manufacturing failed to instill any confidence about a sustainable recovery as it printed 0.6% YoY. The mining sector growth stood at 3.3% YoY versus -2.5% previously. The Electricity sector on the other hand stands out with a stellar performance of 12.9% YoY in September as against -0.2% YoY earlier 
  The Consumer Price index sent another shock wave in the market by surging 10.09% for October from 9.84 % in September, driven by food prices. The food inflation surged to an 8-month high of 12.3% YoY on record high vegetables inflation of 45.7% YoY.

  Meanwhile, the retail price index rose 2.6% in October, below forecasts for a 3.0% increase after rising 3.2% in September. 
  For today, the pound might get a lift if the BoE brings forward the point at which it sees UK unemployment hitting 7% the level at which it would consider raising rates, though a fall in inflation could give the central bank leeway to wait longer. 
  The central bank's inflation report is expected today, with investors watching for any changes in unemployment forecasts or estimates for when the country could reach its 7% unemployment threshold.

  The positive news for the day is that the India's economic growth is expected to pick up slightly in the July-September quarter as improved manufacturing activity steered it from a four-year low in the previous three months. A moderate recovery in Indian factories and exports were probably the main drivers for an increase in overall growth in the quarter through September. Annual industrial output picked up 2 percent in September, driven by an uptick in export and domestic orders. 
  With wholesale price inflation moving back above the Reserve Bank of India's perceived comfort level of 5 percent and consumer inflation quickening to more than 10 percent, there is little expectation the central bank will act to ease policy boost growth. 
  A lot as has been said after US-Iran deal, that it would be highly positive for India. Definitely it would be helpful for India, but don't forget with positive you have some cons as well. Till recently, India would buy oil from Iran, and pay 55% in foreign currency, and 45% in rupees. If trading restrictions are removed by the US or EU, it stands that the Iran will undertake business on a competitive basis. 
  This will further impact the exports of Indian basmati rice against aromatic varieties of Thailand and Pakistan. Soymeal, corn, and raw sugar will meet the challenge of South American and Black Sea prices. India would not be alone to offer Iran agro products, the lists of competitors are huge and some have the immense potential to grab the deals from India?s basket. 
 
 
 USD/INR: The positives are frontline news but the derailment of the rupee-for-oil deal with Iran is the biggest threat for India. Without that, there's an additional $5 billion of outflow expected to Iran, which, if not paid in rupees, will have to be paid pack in dollars.As of now there are some small dollar inflows which are helping the rupee and off-setting the month-end demand for dollars. We would continue to see dips around 61.80-62.00 levels where we can see oil firms coming up to buy dollars. Importers keep on buying around dips i.e. 62.20 - 62.25 levels, while exporters can hold for covering next year?s exposures. Intraday exports could be sold around 62.50 levels.

  The Indian rupee rose to a one-week high yesterday helped by gains in the euro and weakness in dollar index. Rupee is expected to trade in the narrow range of 62.20 - 62.60 levels, while for near term we see the range of 61.80 - 63.00 levels. 
  The Indian GDP data is due for tomorrow with expectation of economic growth likely picked up slightly in the July-September quarter as improved manufacturing activity steered it from a four-year low in the previous three months. If the spur of data's reflects positive then we can see rupee continuing its positive move in next week as well. 
  In its effort to support manufacturing activity, the Reserve Bank of India allowed banks to treat loans given to medium manufacturing enterprises after November 13 as priority sector advance, in its efforts to provide enhanced liquidity support to the medium and small enterprises. 
  The RBI also allowed incremental bank loans to medium services enterprises extended after November 13 to up to 100 million rupees and raised the loan limit given to micro and small service enterprises to 100 million rupees from 50 million rupees that will be treated as priority sector advance. This facility will remain open till March 31, 2014. 
  The Indian Cabinet is likely to take a decision today on relaxing FDI norms for the housing sector and reducing foreign investment limit to 49 percent in rare and critical areas of the pharma segment. The Cabinet would also deliberate on the stand to be taken by India in the forthcoming WTO meet in Bali between 3rd - 6th December. 
  With this development in local market the investors would continue to monitor global dollar and euro moves for further directions. The Euro hit its highest in four years against the yen and rose versus the dollar on after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives reached a deal with the Social Democrats on forming a grand coalition. 
  The dollar extended its losses against the euro and British pound but continued to trade higher against the Japanese Yen and commodity currencies. The lack of consistency in the performance of the greenback this week has not changed, reflecting the impact of relative growth and divergent monetary policy direction on currency flows. 
 
 USD/INR: Throughout the week, this divergence has widened, driving many currency pairs to multiyear highs as investors pile into European currencies and dump commodity currencies. With U.S. markets closed on today so the volume in the FX market is expected to decline. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economy probably will grow more slowly next year than some forecasters predict and indicated that a record U.S. stock market isn't in a bubble. For the day, Importers can eye to buy around 62.20 - 62.25 levels, while exporters should sell on rallies for near term exposure. The market is juggling between 62 - 63 levels, which is also seen a comfort range for RBI. Any further news/events from both local and international would be important to watch.

  Followed by Unemployment claims which marked at 298k against 299k earlier. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits were little changed last week as employers held on to staff in an improving economy clearly indicates that the improving employment market is steady. 
  Pending home sales marked at 3.3% against -1.3% earlier as it rebounded in July and have now risen in four of the last five months. The index is at its highest level since August 2013 and is above 100 which is considered an average level of contract activity for the third consecutive month and which has helped the dollar index to hold its ground. 
  On Friday, Personal spending came at -0.1% against 0.4% earlier falling unexpectedly even if the employment numbers continue to impress the analyst. The fall in consumer spending is due to Household purchase which decreased. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, has been held back by tight credit and meager wage growth that is barely able to keep up with inflation. 
  Chicago PMI registered at 64.3 against 54.2 earlier recovering all the ground lost last month. Components for production, new orders and order backlogs all rose which is a positive sign.

  The local unit opened steady at 60.50 against a close of 60.5150 on Thursday. Most Asian equities are in green, in the hope that Chinese government will go ahead with additional stimulus after the HSBC Chinese PMI came in weaker at 51.1 and the manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.2 against a reading of 50.3 earlier.

  On Friday, US Stocks ended higher ahead of the Labour day weekend with the S&P 500 closing above 2000 for the third time this week. But the dollar really strengthened on a weaker Euro, as a poor inflation number at 0.3% (against a previous reading of 0.4%) as well as a weak retail sales number in Germany and even problems in Finland on account of Ukraine tensions. In fact Ukraine tensions drove down the Euro to an all time low of$1.3126, ahead of the ECB meeting this week. In contrast, the numbers out of the UK continue to remain strong, with housing prices showing resilience as the BoE Governor Carney continues to indicate lower interest rates going ahead. 
  Meanwhile in Asia, Japan?s household spending came in much lower than expectations, though data on factory orders showed that businesses spent in this quarter. But the anti corruption drive in China continues to impact growth in Hong Kong. While the Nikeii is up after two days of profit booking last week, Asian stocks are mixed. In early trade, the Sensex is up 170 points and the Nifty trades at record 8008 levels. 
  In domestic news, the Indian economy expanded 5.7%, the highest in nine quarters against a reading of 4.6% earlier. In an interview with the media, the Central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan also reiterated that India today is in a much better position to handle interest rate increases in the US on account of the upturn in economic activity here. FII investment in India has meanwhile crossed the $30 billion mark, with a $17 billion investment in debt and the rest in equity. The manufacturing PMI for August 2014 came at 52.4 as against 53.00 at the end of the last month. 
  Technically speaking, USDINR is moving in a range of 60.40-60.70 levels. On Thursday it went up and made a high of 60.70 levels on Ukraine crisis but closed at 60.5150 levels which clearly suggest that it was a whipsaw. There is some good buying by state run banks below 60.40 levels while FII?s are sellers at allhigher levels. The pair if has to move till 61.00 levels, it needs to close above 60.62 levels and sustain above it. Failure to do so will enable this pair to stay in a range of 60.40-60.60 levels.

Maruti Gujarat plans: Will small investors be shortchanged?,"{""Maruti Gujarat"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/marutis-gujarat-plans-will-small-investors-be-shortchanged/articleshow/29500510.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maruti's Gujarat plans: Will small investors be shortchanged?,"MUMBAI: Shares of auto major Maruti Suzuki plunged in trade today after its board approved the parent company’s decision to set up a separate 100 per cent subsidiary. 

 Maruti Suzuki would enter into a contract with this subsidiary under which all production in the subsidiary company would be in accordance with the requirements of MSIL and the vehicles would be sold to MSIL, Maruti Suzuki said in the filing with the BSE. MSIL will continue to pay royalty to the parent company. 

 This has raised corporate governance concerns in the company as experts are of the view that small investors will be shortchanged. 

 
Following are the views of brokerages and experts on the company’s decision: 

 
Kotak Securities: 

 The stock has tanked post announcement of Gujarat expansion. Suzuki will do contract manufacturing for Maruti Suzuki at the Gujarat plant which implies Maruti will not put any capex in the Gujarat plant and will give contract manufacturing income and cash to cover incremental capital expenditure to Suzuki. 

 This implies that contribution margin on the sale of vehicles from Gujarat will be significantly lower than current margins but return ratio will be higher given no capex by Maruti Suzuki. 

 
UBS: 

 Maruti has decided to pursue Gujarat expansion through a 100 per cent Suzuki subsidiary. The subsidiary would be a manufacturing company with Maruti as its only customer. 

 This is again likely to create an issue of corporate governance and relationship with the parent. 

 It is likely that most of the future exports could be pursued through this Gujarat plant and Maruti may make only the marketing margin. 

 
Anil Singhvi, Chairman, Ican Investment 

 It is absurd to say the least because Maruti board and even Suzuki for that matter should not stoop down to that level. This is short-changing minority shareholders in India. We have seen these kind of abuses being committed by MNCs and Suzuki should have realised more than anyone else that Maruti has been one of the biggest successes of Suzuki. 

 Why do they want to let this profitable company go through this kind of hurdles? What is the Maruti board doing on this? How can they allow this? 

 This is complete fraud actually. This is where I believe that Indian board should rise above these petty considerations and raise their voice to the parents. 

 
Silky Jain, Research Analyst, Nirmal Bang 

 The response which we have got is completely negative. We were not expecting this thing to happen and so the stock has also reacted negatively. We do not see it perform in the near term but then downside is capped. 

 The stock ended at Rs 1,563.20, down 8.12 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 1,750.10 and a low of Rs 1,541.25 in trade today. 

 Clarity on the subsidiary issue will emerge after the concall. Brokerages are expected to a fresh- take on the stock post that."

 Since early March when the rift between the Maruti management and non-promoter shareholders first drew media attention, the stock price has climbed 18 per cent to Rs 1,868, from Rs 1,580. However, none of the large shareholders have sold a single share. 

 While it’s a widely shared perception that the Suzuki proposal is a raw deal for minority shareholders, one wonders whether a few of them are sensing this as an opportunity to push the company to dip into its cash reserve of more than Rs 3,500 crore to come out with a buyback offer."

Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: What is the call that you are making on the index as well as stock specific strategies? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: On the index, I remain positive but again, it is basically a market which is slightly overbought. So one of these days and it appears that today afternoon, we could have had some kind of profit booking. The market might consolidate after hitting newer highs but one of these days, that kind of price movement is expected to happen but for the time being, the trend is firmly on the upside. So you are broadly carrying about a 100-point kind of risk but overall, this is a market which is poised to go much higher from current levels.
 
 The CNX IT, which was for the last four-five days not really participating but more of consolidating sideways, has started to pick up and if that can contribute along with the Bank Nifty, we should see 9000 being hit fairly fast. That does appear to be the kind of scenario and any kind of decline of 70-80 points on intraday basis or a one-two-day kind of pullback should be used to possibly add onto long positions."

Now it is probably not likely that Mahindra & Mahindra will go into big bear market and go towards 300 but will trade around the lower levels of its range, probably retest levels around 550 in this kind of a down move.

US Generic launches are key to Lupin growth,"{""Lupin"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/us-generic-launches-are-key-to-lupin-growth/articleshow/46118219.cms,m.economictimes.com,US Generic launches are key to Lupin growth,"Lupin, one of the most consistent performers in the pharma sector, reported lower-than-expected revenue growth for the third quarter due to sluggishness in its overseas businesses. However, given a strong pipeline of new drug applications and a diversified geographical presence, the company's long-term prospects look strong. This could be a major reason why its stock did not react sharply on Tuesday despite depressed growth numbers. 

 Lupin's revenue grew 5% yearon-year to Rs 3,144.9 crore during the December 2014 quarter, much lower than the analysts' expectation of 12-14% growth. However, lower raw material costs pushed the operating margin up 200 basis points to 28%. 

 A high base effect characterised by three material drug launches in the US in the third quarter of the last fiscal and delay in drug approvals curtailed the US business growth to 4%.The US business is the largest product segment contributing nearly half of the company's consolidated revenues. For the nine months ended December, the US business grew 24%. 

 With the management expecting growth of 15-20% in the US business for the fiscal, the subdued show in the US seems to be an aberration. The domestic business, constituting one-fourth of the revenue, continued to gain from the low-base effect and recent recovery in volumes.
 
 Lupin's Japan business was impacted by a mix of factors such as yen depreciation and changing market dynamics. With pressures on cost, small players don't have it easy.Being the eighth-largest generic company, Lupin has its fair share of challenges to overcome. 

 In the forthcoming quarters, key generic launches in the US will be one of the major growth drivers for Lupin. The company has over 97 abbreviated new drug applications pending approval -one-third of these are the first to file applications (bearing 180day exclusive marketing rights). 

 Bulk of these approvals is likely to come around over the next two fiscals."

  Company's net profit in 2010-11 declined 10% to 3,957.89 crore. Analysts were not perturbed by the decline since it was primarily because the previous year's profits were boosted by higher exceptional gain on divestment of stake in subsidiaries. Recurring net profit for the year was up 15% year-on-year. 
  
  L&T reported a total income of 43,904.91 crore for the year ended March, up 19% on year, missing the 20% guidance marginally. 
  
  Larsen & Toubro missed its sales and order inflow guidance for 2010-11 but is confident that revenue in the current fiscal will grow by a quarter, driven by a pick-up in orders and execution of projects. 
  
  
  Here are few views and recommendations on the stock: 
  
  
  L&T has taken the market by surprise: Deepak Mohoni, trendwatchindia.com
  
  L&T has, by the looks of it, taken the market by surprise because it was not very far maybe just 1% or 2% to go on the downside and it would have been at a 2 or 3-year low. The market, given the way the stock was moving, was clearly not expecting anything that positive. 
  
  When you get something really unexpected and positive, you do get strong moves and we are seeing exactly that in L&T. The upside could be perhaps a lot more than what you would hope for. 
  
  
  L&T looks positive: Prakash Diwan, Networth Stock Broking
  
  The run up yesterday has been quite significant in single session. It has moved significantly and I think you may not see the repeat every day for the next few days but yes it remains in a positive expectation zone of sorts and I would be surprised if it heads to the 1660 kind of a mark and stabilises there for a while before the next set of cues come in. 
  
  So it does looks positive. I do not see any retracement going down from where it has moved up yesterday so looks positive of course you will have to see how the capex cycles are spanning out in the next couple of quarters for the stock to really give some sort of a direction. 
  
  
  Time to be long in L&T: Sudarshan Sukhani, Technical Trends
  
  As a short term trader, it is time to be long in L&T. Yesterday’s rally if the market continues up, we should see significant follow through today also and L&T would this time at least contribute to the gains which the index could come with. 
  
  
  On declines, buy L&T: Ashwani Gujral
  
  1450-1500 was a key support and whatever the results would have been, I do not think they were too good and still you saw 5-6% type of rally. So now on declines, L&T becomes a buy. On the upside 1750 is a good target and in any kind of pullback, it will probably participate."

ET Now: Tata Consultancy has said that Chennai floods will have a material impact on its revenues during this quarter. Do you think that other IT firms will also react to Chennai floods? 

 
Deven Choksey: I am not very sure. 

 The Chennai episode might have a negative impact on the companies but that will play out well. I do not think that market will give discount beyond a point on to this particular subject. 

 Firms like Infosys are adopting a change in their business model. They are venturing into more acquisition-led growth and are particularly investing money into start-ups and creating a better amount of franchisee on that side. This aspect is interesting but it would not not give result benefits, at least in the coming couple of quarters. 

 Currently, I think, one will have to see whether these companies are meeting the projections that they had spelt out. If they do, then the market will not go negative on those companies but otherwise one will have to play tactfully at this point of time in selecting the stocks in the market. 

 As of now we are not getting further exposure in the IT space. So we'd stay muted on that front for now.

Decoding the cryogenic engine used in ISRO launch,"{""ISRO"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-isro-developed-the-indigenous-cryogenic-engine/articleshow/28575364.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,How ISRO developed the indigenous cryogenic engine,"The year was 1987. V Gnanagandhi, head of the cryogenic engine project at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), wanted to set up a high-pressure hydrogen plant in Mahendragiri near Thiruvanathapuram. But an official from the supplier of the machinery, a German company called Messers Grieshem, suddenly threw a spanner in the works. “There are snakes and elephants on the roads in India,” he told them. “How can I come there?” 

 Gnanagandhi reached a compromise with the Grieshem executive. He need come only as far as Mumbai; the entire ISRO team would meet him there. He agreed. The German—his name is now forgotten—agreed to sell the machinery, but was also inquisitive. “Why do you need a high-pressure hydrogen facility?” he asked. “We are using it to launch rockets,” came the answer. “You cannot just fill an engine tank with high-pressure hydrogen,” he told the ISRO team. “It will evaporate in no time.” The ISRO engineers, thus, learned a thing or two about dealing with hydrogen at high pressure. 
  
 A few days ago, Gnanagandhi retired after watching his baby fly on a Geostationary Launch Vehicle (GSLV), marking the culmination of a journey that was shot through with frustrations, technology denials, quiet diplomacy and sheer hard work. After two decades of development, India developed the cryogenic technology, giving it the much-needed capability to launch medium-sized satellites in a geostationary orbit, and joined an exclusive club of six nations. But on that day in 1987, at their Mumbai Guest House, ISRO engineers, led by Gnanagandhi, were taught a thing or two about hydrogen under pressure by their German guest. 

 
Obtaining The Engine 

 Brought into the nascent cryogenic engine team in 1984, Gnanagandhi had begun his job with clean slate. He had not even heard about the cryogenic engine. He didn’t know how to get liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen, let alone how to use them in an engine. But he learned quickly, set up the facilities, and made a one-tonne prototype engine by 1988. It blew up during a test. “We had used liquid nitrogen to clean the nozzle,” says Gnanagandhi. “And nitrogen solidifies and clogs the nozzle at liquid oxygen temperatures.” ISRO was led by UR Rao at that time. ISRO had been planning larger rockets. 

 Cryogenic engines were absolutely essential to put satellites in geostationary orbit, but the technology was difficult and a closely guarded secret. India had offers of engines. US firm General Dynamics offered first at a high price, and so did the French. It was then that Russia, which was going through difficult times, offered it at a reasonable price. India signed a deal in 1991 for two engines and the technology. 

 Everything looked good, but soon wasn’t. The Americans pressurised the Russians into reneging on the deal, saying its engines will be used for nuclear missiles. 

 ISRO would get the engines but not the technology. UR Rao went to talk to the Americans, and to tell them something that everybody knew: cryogenic engines cannot be used in a missile. But the US had strong commercial interests in denying India the technology. Rao’s meeting with vice-president Al Gore was futile. 

 Rao then negotiated with the Russians. “I told them that I had paid them too much money for just two engines,” says Rao. “If you are not giving me the technology, give me six more engines.” Eventually ISRO got seven engines. However, flying them was not a simple matter as there were no data about their performance. The engines that ISRO got hadn’t been flown yet in any rocket. ISRO engineers discovered they had to work hard to make the engines fly in their launch vehicle. “We found that the Russian engines did not perform as well as we expected,” says Vishnu Kartha, who now heads the cryogenic project. 

 
Developing The Technology 

 If flying the Russian engines was hard, copying the engine design was harder. The Russians had designed these engines in the 1960s but not flown them, probably because they were still not flight ready. Moreover, they used a technology— called stage combustion—that was efficient but difficult. It made the engine a bit heavy but gave the highest efficiencies for a specific amount of propellant. The indigenous engines had to be exactly like the Russian engines: the GSLV has already been planned based on them. 

 The Indian government gave a formal approval to the Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) project in 1994. The budget was Rs 300 crore. ISRO then made a key decision quite in keeping with its tradition: involve the private industry from the beginning. “We didn’t want to first develop the technology and then transfer it,” says BN Suresh, now Vikram Sarabhai distinguished professor in ISRO. 

 The two major partners were Godrej and the MTAR Technologies. Godrej set up the rotary vacuum brazing facility in Mumbai. Brazing was a key and difficult technology, and setting up the facility took more than a year. MTAR made the turbo pump and some other components. 

 The sophistication of the cryogenic engine would be obvious from a few simple facts. The liquid hydrogen is kept at -253 degree centigrade. The turbo pump operates at 500 degree centigrade and rotates 40,000 times a minute. The combustion temperature is around 3,000 degree centigrade. 

 The pressure inside the combustion chamber is 60 times the atmospheric pressure. The chamber wall has to withstand the high pressure and temperature. No material can withstand a temperature of 3,000 degree centigrade, and so the combustion chamber wall has to be cooled. 

 
Lift Off 

 ISRO’s cryogenic team made the first 7.5-tonne engine in 2000. It blew up while being tested. The hydrogen valve had prematurely closed, affecting the oxygenhydrogen ratio in the combustion chamber. “We became failure-hardened,” says Mohammed Mulsim, head of the cryogenic project at that time. “After each failure we went back not to the Russian engines but to the drawing board.” They succeeded finally in 2002. The indigenous cryogenic engine was qualified in 2003. It took another four years to integrate it with the GSLV. But the first flight failed in 2010, as the engine shut down three seconds after ignition. 

 ISRO then conducted a thorough review of the entire GSLV project. For the cryogenic engine, special vacuum testing facilities were created at Mahendragiri. By 2013 end, every likely cause of failure was looked into. A few days before the GSLV flew on January 5, ISRO officials conducted a review meeting to clear the vehicle for launch. Such meetings usually take several hours. This one ended in 45 minutes. Every possibility had been analysed, and project leaders were quietly confident. 

 When it flew, the GSLV put the satellite into orbit with a precision never possible with the Russian engines. “We took a long time to develop the engine,” says ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan, “but all countries took 10-15 years to develop cryogenic technology.” ISRO now has to develop a more powerful engine, to put a 4-tonne satellite into geosynchronous orbit. The older generation that led the first cryogenic engine development has retired. It has been such a long journey, it gave the younger generation now in command a deep understanding of cryogenic technology. And they have long stints left in ISRO."

The kind of moves Indian markets are giving are in complete contrast to emerging markets as well as world markets. The probability of that historically would not be more than 5%. Whether this 5% carries on is what we need to see.


What is the outlook on the realty sector because NCC management was talking about how there has been a slowdown in construction but things are certainly picking up. Now a lot of global uncertainties are out of the way?
The NCC management over a period of time has become very conservative so they give conservative guidance but the way they have managed their balance sheet vis-à-vis other construction companies is something that I like plus the dividend payout.

Look at the dividend yield of any infra company; it would be 1% or less than 1%. The dividend yield at Rs 2 is almost 3% of the stock price when they declared the dividend. The company is growing well and we still do not see fund managers wanting to buy infra stocks. While people have started buying capital goods stocks, infra stocks are still not much in demand. That is an opportunity for investors who are willing to buy and hold for a bit longer.


What is your take regarding the entire diagnostics basket that went for a tizzy when Adani announced that they are looking to get into the diagnostic space? Today we saw some of these names bouncing back. Is there an underlying story there?
There is no story. The competitive intensity is increasing substantially. Lupin has got into it. The Adani group has announced plans. Torrent Pharma has also announced entry into diagnostics. It seems to be a tough space. Pricing will remain under pressure and as it is, the Covid-led testing spike will get over. So, in the next year or year-and-a-half, there will be a base impact which will keep the growth slow.

A combination of slow growth combined with margin compression will be the story for diagnostics. The one-off, one week kind of moves will keep on happening but directionally I do not see a story here.

After the sugar rush of the Covid business was over, the diagnostic stocks are down 20-50% from the recent high but these are businesses which are still growing. There is 10-15% growth and consolidation is happening. Plus four-five players are still there?
The number of players on the organised side are increasing and the second thing we need to understand is that at peak, Dr Lal went to 100 price earning ratio which was unsustainable. Today given the earning cuts which have happened, it trades at around 60 times. Whoever wants to give a 10-12% growth business, 60 PE, it is good for them and if they make money out of it, better but I do not see a story at five times PEG on a longer term."
Why long-term investors should stay invested in Infosys,"{""Infosys"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-long-term-investors-should-stay-invested-in-infosys/articleshow/44768879.cms,m.economictimes.com,Why long-term investors should stay invested in Infosys,"Infosys under its new leadership seems to be marching ahead in the right direction. A while ago, the company announced its September quarter financials, which were slightly better than the consensus of analysts’ estimates. Moreover, it also issued bonus shares signalling the management’s confidence in the future growth.  However, contrary to the expectation of some analysts, the company did not revise the full year dollar revenue growth guidance of 7-9%. But, that need not disappoint long-term investors.  Here’s why it makes sense to stay invested in the stock if you believe in the long-term, value driven investing: The bonus issue: Infosys has declared one bonus share for every existing share and 1:1 stock dividend for American Depository Shares. Technically, an issue of a bonus shares does not have any material impact on the shareholder since the share price will be adjusted once the process of allotment of bonus shares begins, i.e. after the record date. But, it does offer an insight into what the management is thinking of the future growth. This is because bonus shares increase the capital base of the company since a chunk of surplus profit in the balance sheet is converted into equity. A company that pays dividends regularly and has a responsible management will do this only when it is confident that it would be able to serve this larger capital base through dividends, and buybacks of shares in the future.  Sustained business momentum in the US and Europe: Growth in these two key markets sustained during the September quarter on a sequential basis. The US grew by 3.1% and Europe by 4.2%. While the growth in the financial services vertical continued to stay tepid at 1.2%, other verticals such as manufacturing and energies, utilities, communications and services was buoyant.  Attrition: Attrition touched a high of 20.1% during the September 2014 quarter compared with 19.5% a quarter ago and 17.3% a year ago. This is expected to decrease in the coming quarters considering the efforts of CEO Vishal Sikka to retain talent. According to recent media reports, the management had undertaken revision of senior management salaries. The company also gave promotions to 12,000 employees during the September quarter apart from giving 100% of variable pay to all employees.  Operating performance: Infosys has been posting subdued growth compared with what some of its bigger and smaller peers have been reporting and also lower than the industry average. This is expected to change albeit slowly. To begin with, the company has been able to keep the fall in its operating margin under check. In the September quarter, it reported a margin of 26.1%, a 100 basis points improvement over the previous quarter. The days for which sales was outstanding were 63, an improvement over 67 days a quarter ago.  Strong cash management: Infosys has over $4.5 billion (close to Rs 28,000 crore) of cash and equivalents. Its cash generation from operations has also remained strong over the years. With focus on growth, the new management is in the process of finding the right opportunities to deploy the cash."

 1. In Budget 2013, the finance minister has announced a proposal to introduce inflation-indexed bonds (IIB) or inflation-indexed national security certificates.
 
 2. The fixed income instruments pay a stipulated interest through the term of the bond. The real return for the investor will be low in keeping with the inflation.
 
 3. The impact of inflation is higher for those who invest in long-term fixed income bonds. The IIBs will be of interest to the investors seeking to protect their long-term debt portfolio from the effects of inflation.
 
 4. The IIBs negate inflation as the interest received on bonds and maturity value are linked to the prevailing inflation. The principal amount is adjusted by an inflation indexation factor for each interest payment period.
 
 5. The choice of the inflation measure used as a benchmark to adjust for inflation will determine the efficacy of the bonds in protecting the investor against the effect of inflation.
 
 6. The taxability of interest income, maturity value and the relative attractiveness of the post-tax returns of the bonds compared with other fixed income options must be evaluated before making a decision.

 The move follows poor response to the bonds, which the government had hoped will click with investors as an opportunity to invest in assets that produce real returns. “We have got some feedback. We are in discussion with the government, so some clarification will come...on existing features some clarification has been sought,” said RBI deputy governor HR Khan.
 
 The central bank on Thursday also held a meeting with bank chairmen on how to popularise the saving instrument amongst investors. Distribution or sale of bonds is done through banks. “We will come with something. All of them have committed. Issues of marketing, availability of forms, awareness campaign, all these things are happening and banks chairmen have committed to take it forward,” said Khan.
 
 Subscription to these bonds was initially open only for nine days in December (December 23-December 31) but the RBI had extended the offer to March 31, 2014 due to poor response.
 
 Khan said demand for such bonds is now picking up and immediately there will be no feature changes. The minimum limit for investment through these instruments is .`5,000 and the maximum is .`5 lakh per applicant, annually. The government hopes these bonds will wean investors away from gold by offering a real 1.5% return over retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
 
 The government is looking to contain gold imports at 850 tonnes this fiscal against 950 tonnes in the corresponding period last year. The Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-Cumulative are available only to individuals, Hindu Undivided Family, registered charitable institutions and approved universities."

Up to 50% of the issue will be allocated to QIBs and up to 30% of the QIB portion may be allocated to anchor investors at a discretionary price.The company is mainly into software application development and maintenance but has diversified into other areas such as remote infrastructure management and R&D services. Over 60% of its revenues come from application development. It counts some big names, such as IBM, Fujitsu, Alcatel-Lucent, General Electric, ACS (now owned by Xerox) and Verizon, among its clients. The company’s CEO Upinder Zutshi said its strategy was to position itself as an alternative to large IT service providers and focus on large clients. While the focus on large clients has helped it bag big names, a source of potential risk could be that 90% of its revenues come from its top 10 customers. The top client contributes about 35% of its revenues."

Nonlegistative in nature and approved in principle by all financial regulators, some of these steps can be implemented over the next few weeks. ET takes you through the proposals:  	Revamp ADR/GDR scheme, enlarge the scope of depository receipts (DRs)  	Indian companies, including unlisted ones, will find it easier to raise money. They will be permitted to issue DRs to international investors against any underlying security -- like debenture, mutual fund, government bond as well as equity. At present, depository receipts can be issued with only equity as underlying security. The proposed changes are based on recommendations made by the MS Sahoo panel which said DRs can also be issued in any jurisdiction that is IOSCO and FATF compliant without any end-use restriction on funds.  	Liberalise the rupee-denominated corporate bond market  	This is aimed at attracting more foreign inflows in rupee-denominated bonds. As a short-term measure, the government, last June, had cut withholding tax for two years, from 20% to 5% to enable greater inflows in debt market. Chances are that the market can be freed up to introduce more products. At present, foreign investors can invest only in listed non-convertible debentures issued by Indian firms. The liberalisation move could also create a legal framework for rupee-denominated offshore bonds that can be listed abroad.  	Strengthen currency derivatives market  	 					 	Many companies, particularly smaller ones, are unable to hedge their foreign exchange risks effectively in the overthe-counter market, thanks to costs. For such corporates, listed currency derivatives can offer a cheaper route to guard against a rising or falling dollar. Here, the margins are lower and transactions more transparent. This market can deepen with higher position limits and opening the doors to large funds. Such trades, however, need a daily monitoring of mark-to-market losses, if any.  	Smoother clearing and settlement for international investors in bonds  	In order to liven up a lacklustre corporate bond market, the government intends to provide a seamless and risk-free settlement of trades. This could call for local depositories tying up with their foreign counterparts. Since the average deal size in bonds is larger compared to equities, the counter-party risk is also higher with most trades happening outside the exchange. Financial market participants, however, are not enthused by the suggestions as bond market reforms have been hanging fire for more than a decade."

The broker is reportedly miffed with the bourse for having written to regulators like RBI and Sebi to declare the company “not fit and proper” to run its business after a director’s arrest in connection with the NSEL scam. 

 The company feels the defunct bourse, itself an accused in the scam, has no locus standi to ask regulators, which don’t oversee IIFL, to declare it unfit.

 Idea Cellular needs to bid for 2G spectrum in the 1,800 megahertz (MHz) band in at least seven circles following cancellation of licences in these circles by the Supreme Court in early February. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued a memorandum on Monday detailing the base price for the auction in each of the 22 telecom circles in the country.

 The calculations show that at the base level, Idea will spend Rs 1,960 crore to regain these licences. But it will only pay one-third or Rs 653 crore upfront and enjoy a moratorium of two years wherein it need not pay interest and the principal amount of debt.
 
 The company reported a cash balance of Rs 126.5 crore at the end of June 2012, which means it will have to largely depend upon borrowings to fund the auction outgo. Assuming it funds the whole down payment through debt, the loan funds on its book will increase to Rs 12,265 crore from Rs 11,612 crore as of June 2012. Its debt-equity ratio will inch up by a modest 5 basis points to 0.92. Net debt (debt less cash on books) relative to earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBITDA) will also increase by a tad 14 basis points to 2.42 times.
 
 Further, the impact will remain muted even in case of aggressive bidding. Telecom minister Kapil Sibal told ET on Friday that he expects pan-India license bid to go as high as Rs 20,000 crore, over 42% more than the reserve price of Rs 14,000 crore. Assuming a proportionate increase in the bidding in each of the seven circles where Idea will bid, the company's debt will increase to Rs 12,526.2 crore. Its debt-equity ratio will increase to 0.94 from the current 0.87 and net debt as a percentage of EBITDA will inch up to 2.62.
 
 Industry trackers, however, expect a muted response for the auction given the existing debt burden of the telecom sector. ""The bidding may not be aggressive as it was during the 3G auction two years ago since teclos will have to borrow more funds,"" says Romal Shetty, telecom practice head, KPMG. He expects a selective bidding with most palyers bidding for limited number of circles. Norway's Telenor, which lost nine licences, will have to shell out over Rs 7,000 crore at the reserve price.
 
 Established players such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone are less likely to participate in the auction but they will have to accept the spectrum price that will be decided through the bidding process at the time of renewing their licences. Bharti, for instance, will renew its licenses in Delhi and Kolkata in 2014, which will cost over Rs 4,000 crore at the reserve price.
 
 Telecom players are expected to gain traction in data driven services with advent of new technologies that tend to merge personal computation with mobility. This should cushion the spectrum outgo in the long run."

  In an unusual development, the BoR shareholders had voted yesterday after the bank management summarily called off the meeting citing a stay by a Kolkata civil court, which ICICI Bank got vacated.
  
  While the shareholders of BoR communicated their decision to the stock exchanges, saying the ""scheme of amalgamation has been duly passed by the required majority"", BoR officials maintained throughout the day that they would approach stock exchanges only after getting the decision legally validated.
  
  BoR's Managing Director and CEO G Padmanabhan said the bank has sought legal opinion on the matter, adding that the bank is in touch with the Reserve Bank about the developments.
  
  ICICI Bank said in a separate statement that its shareholders have approved the merger at the company's Extraordinary General Meeting in Vadodara yesterday.
  
  Shares of BoR settled nearly one per cent up at Rs 176.15 a piece, while that of ICICI shed 0.87 per cent to close at Rs 893.15 a share.
  
  The integration would help ICICI Bank increase its branch network by 25 per cent to about 2,500 across the country. It will give great visibility to ICICI Bank in western and northern parts of the country.
  
  Currently, ICICI Bank has about 2,000 branches while BoR has 463 spread across the country.
  
  Post merger, the balancesheet of ICICI Bank would cross Rs four lakh crore. BoR has a total business of over Rs 23,000-crore, as against nearly Rs 3,84,000-crore of ICICI Bank. BoR's turnover was Rs 1,507-crore in 2008-09, while that of ICICI Bank in 2009-10 was over Rs 33,000-crore.
  
  ICICI Bank last month agreed to take over Bank of Rajasthan in a share-swap deal that valued the Udaipur-based bank at over Rs 3,000-crore.
  
  The share swap ratio was fixed at one ICICI Bank share for every 4.72 shares of BoR."

  The group has appointed HSBC affiliate Saudi British Bank to manage the initial public offering of Petromin, its equal venture with Saudi Arabia-based Dabbagh Group, Gulf Oil International chairman Sanjay Hinduja told a press conference in Mumbai. Gulf Oil International is Hinduja group’s holding company in lubricant business. It holds nealy 50% stake in India-listed Gulf Oil Corpoaration. “Soon, we will finalise the timeline and the exact size of the initial share sale,” he said. Petromin, which has an annual sales of $500 million and controls one-third share of the downstream oil products market in Saudi Arabia, will sell a 30% stake through the IPO, he added.
  
  Gulf Oil International and the Dabbagh Group bought Petromin a few years ago from Saudi Aramco and Mobil Investments, an affiliate of ExxonMobil. Saudi Arabia is a cash-rich market. Unlike the European markets, there is a strong demand for oil and oil products in Saudi Arabia, he said adding, Petromin is looking for acquisitions in the Gulf region to boost its business.
  
  Mr Hinduja said the group is also planning an IPO in Hong Kong for Gulf Oil Marine, another unit of Gulf Oil International that sells marine lubricants. The group had started the company 18 months ago. In India, Gulf Oil Corporation is planning to tie up with a British firm to enter the defence business, he said without providing details. 
  
  The group plans to set up 10,000 mw of power in India over five years, said co-chairman Gopichand Hinduja. This includes a 1,040 mw power plant that the group took 13 years to complete at Vizag. “To make infrastructure more appealing to foreign and domestic investors, there should be accountability at every level of the project, and a responsibility to stick to timelines,” he said. The group is looking for plant sites in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, he said. “ We will announce two power plants very soon,” he added."

  What is the sense a little bit of tizzy over last few sessions, never mind the fact that earnings have not been too disappointing?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: Yes, it has been a function of liquidity for a while and we are probably in a phase where mode of primary issuance is there. So the liquidity has to taper off both the primary and the secondary markets. Yes I agree the results have by and large been pretty much on track barring a few exceptions here and there. So I would not be too disappointed by the results but given the valuations, given that these have been led up by a reasonable amount of liquidity inflows, if those are not sustained, then we are going to probably see these kind of range bound markets for a while and that is a good thing for the market because it allows people to consolidate and then move on.
   
  
  Going forward from here, how much of a decline can sell off by FIIs in a significant way cause and where will you start drawing the line of danger?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: The FII sell off would be dangerous for the market very clearly because if you look at it, the domestics have been pretty much net sellers for quite a while now and FIIs have been buyers by a margin and they have been buying fairly large amounts for few months now especially beginning September. Now if that dries up, all that stability towards the primary markets, that would be your cause for concern. 
  
  Obviously the markets correct, you would expect to see the domestics getting back into the market but my experience is that when markets start falling, then people tend to wait for it to fall a little bit more before they really enter in. So it becomes a little bit of a vicious cycle. So very difficult to put a number to it but yes, if selling like yesterday from FIIs contuse for a while, that could be in a little bit correction in the market. What that number is whether it is 5% or 10% more, it is tough to call.
   
  
  What have you liked the most post the numbers? Are there any pockets that you would probably enter into with a 6-month, 1-year, 2-year horizon?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: If you look at just the results in terms of what really were a positive surprise, IT numbers were definitely a positive surprise. Some of the banking numbers have been a positive surprise as well. So these sectors have done well. Some of the pharma numbers which have come out have been fairly robust as well. So these are sectors which seem to be doing well. Capital goods numbers, especially the equipment guys, some of the smaller equipment guys as well as some of the larger cap good players have also done well. 
  
  So these are some of the elements which seem to be playing out giving some sense that we are getting the corporate capex back on track and that could develop into a bigger theme as we go forward few quarters. What has disappointed probably in terms of numbers is maybe the cement sector. The numbers have not been very great. So by and large these are our understanding of the results but still large number of results are still to come and we will see how it develops.
   
  
  Going forward from here, do you think that steel as a space is something that you would probably stay out of?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: We have been staying out of commodities especially metals for a while and we will continue to do that. The reason we have not really been too much interested in this space is that it is very much linked to the global economic scenario and that by no means is showing any greater sense of improvement. So we want to avoid the sector as far as possible."

Mr Nayar had no comment on Mr Chandrasekaran’s appointment as second-in-command, citing the ‘silent period’ requirements prior to the announcement of his company’s results on Monday. Mr Chandra, as he is often addressed, is in his mid-40s and worked with global retailer Target Corp before moving to HCL. At Target’s India operations, he was vice-president for technology and part of the executive leadership team, reporting to the global CIO.Mr Chandra is the latest in a succession of global hands joining Indian technology companies, which are looking to strengthen their services delivery capability in a tough business environment. In recent months, Wipro Technologies hired Martha Bejar from Microsoft to head global sales and HCL roped in ex-Siemens and KPMG executive Rothin Bhattacharya as CEO of its offshoot, HCL Security. Rivals such as TCS and Patni too have been adding key talent from overseas in recent months, according to headhunters.Despite robust results, Indian technology firms see business growth in a recovered economy slouching. An analysis of S&P 500 companies shows that by June 2010, only 24% companies are expected to register a year-on-year growth of over 10%. “As tech companies look to expand their services offering, they have to search outside for relevant expertise,” said Gita Dang, founder director, Talent Advisory Services, an executive search firm.Adds K Sudarshan, managing partner, EMA Partners International: “The top management DNA of Indian IT, which has largely been grown in-house, is changing as companies look beyond the commodity business and seek to move up the value chain.’’ Executives with overseas expertise can help tech companies scour for opportunities across the globe. The Kraft-Cadbury deal, where Kraft faces SAP integration challenges with Cadbury, is a case in point. IT companies have to demonstrate not only technology implementation skills but also understand the confectionery business to clinch a deal. “To get such businesses, companies need deep domain experts and hence they have started looking outside,’’ said Mr Sudarshan. At present, IBM and EDS handle Kraft’s systems.In a recent interaction, Saurabh Govil, senior vice-president, talent engagement & development, Wipro Technologies had said, ``We have appointed senior executives from the industry to strengthen domain expertise in the last one year.’’Mr Chandra’s recruitment is HCL Technologies’ first major top-deck addition in over two years. He is said to have a sound knowledge of high-tech, retail, consumer and utility industries as well as expertise in managing global outsourcing engagements.

"India valuations are less compelling, says Goldman Sachs","{""Goldman Sachs"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/paytm-current-share-price-compelling-entry-point-for-goldman-sachs/articleshow/94392648.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Paytm current share price compelling entry point for Goldman Sachs,"Even as investors are dumping Paytm stock, global brokerage Goldman Sachs believes that the depression in share prices is offering a compelling entry point into India’s largest and amongst the fastest-growing fintech platforms.

After the 47% year-to-date dip seen in Paytm shares on concerns around the path to profitability, Goldman sees the stock rallying around 58% to hit Rs 1,100 in the next 12 months.

The target price is still below Paytm's issue price of Rs 2,150. As compared to the current price, Paytm shares are still down over 67% for those who invested in the IPO.

”We see the business model as continuing to show strong traction, and within our internet coverage, view Paytm as one of the most compelling growth stories at an attractive price,” Goldman said in a report.

“While we recognise that lock-in expiry (86% of Paytm’s outstanding shares) in Nov ‘22 may represent an overhang on the stock, we expect Paytm to deliver c.50% revenue growth for the next few quarters and continue its transition from an erstwhile payments-only business to one with a strong financial services portfolio,” it said.

With valuation at 3.6x FY24 EV/Sales, a 30% discount to India internet peer group, the brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating on Paytm and added the stock to conviction list.

Goldman’s analysis suggests the current share price is implying scenarios such as zero revenues from Paytm’s BNPL product and halving of take rates for other lending products, or adjusted EBITDA profitability not until FY27, or 0% revenue growth starting FY33, among other outcomes, which is seen as “unlikely and overdone”. The brokerage firm’s risk-reward analysis indicates 112% upside in a bull case vs 12% downside in a bear case.

Paytm is currently trading at 3.6x FY24 revenues, similar vs global peers, but with a CY21-24E sales CAGR of 38%, vs 29% for the peer group.

“On EV/gross profit, however, Paytm at 5.6x FY24 GP, trades at an 11% discount to peers, for a gross profit growth that is 1.3x vs peers. Even within India internet, Paytm’s growth outlook is similar vs peer group, but valuation is at the lower end,” Goldman said.

Following the report, Paytm shares were trading 2 per cent higher at Rs 699.9 on BSE in a weak market. Trendlyne data shows that out of the 11 analysts with a coverage on the stock, 6 have buy ratings and 3 have sell ratings with the remaining 2 calling it a hold.

Should you bet on gold loan companies?,"{""gold loan companies"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/should-you-bet-on-gold-loan-companies/articleshow/19290169.cms,m.economictimes.com,Should you bet on gold loan companies?,"A 5 per cent drop in gold prices should not be cause for alarm since it can be seen as a temporary correction, right? Yet, gold loan companies are scurrying for cover, with Manappuram Finance, a prominent lender against the security of gold, witnessing the fallout of this price drop last week. Its shares lost 30 per cent of value in just two trading sessions, a reaction to the company’s declaration that it was expecting revenue losses in the current quarter due to the dip. 


The shares of Muthoot Finance also took a slight hit. Though all gold loan companies claim to have a sufficient cushion against the decline in gold prices, are their business models sturdy enough to withstand a sustained fall? More importantly, should you be putting your money in the stocks and bonds of these lenders?

A rigid model 

The business proposition of gold loan companies is simple: they disburse loans to people who are willing to offer their gold possessions as collateral. The sanctioned loan is lesser than the worth of the pledged jewellery, which acts as a safety margin for the lender. Should the borrower default on the loan, the company can sell the pledged gold in the market through an auction. Since the value of the actual loan is less than the value of gold, a slight drop in gold price does not come in the way of the company recovering its money.

However, the model’s simplicity makes it susceptible since the profitability of the company hinges entirely on a low default rate and stability in gold prices. The lender bets on the fact that the borrower is not likely to default as he is typically attached to the jewellery and would want it back. However, this argument does not hold much water. If, for some reason, gold prices tank by, say, more than 20 per cent, it would actually be an incentive for the borrower to default.

Suppose a company gives Rs 80 as loan against gold jewellery worth Rs 100. Assuming a 25 per cent rate of interest, the borrower would owe the company Rs 100. Now, if gold prices fall by 15 per cent, the value of the gold pledged as collateral comes down to Rs 85. A person who is struggling to make ends meet will no longer have an incentive to pay back the money. This is another problem with gold loan companies: most of their clients are not credit worthy, pledging their jewellery since they they are badly strapped for cash and have no other alternative.


	 
For the company, too, the credit profile of the borrower takes a backseat since growth comes from lending more and more. If, however, gold prices fall, it is a potential minefield for the company. In the case of Manappuram, the problem is acute because the loan-tovalue (LTV) ratio is very high.

Since March 2012, the revised Reserve Bank of India guidelines require the loans to be capped at 60 per cent of the value of pledged gold. Prior to this, most companies were lending at much higher LTVs (up to 85 per cent in some cases) as soaring gold prices did not warrant caution.

About 15 per cent of the loans disbursed by Manappuram in the third quarter of the fiscal year are now under stress as these were lent at high LTVs, with the average LTV for its outstanding loans being 70 per cent. Even at a higher LTV, the risk to the lender’s principal remains low unless gold prices fall much more sharply.


				

However, it also means that if the borrower defaults, the lender has to forgo the anticipated interest income on the loan. Since lenders account for these receivables in their books, a default or under-recovery means a large-scale reversal in interest income. Besides, the bullet nature of repayment, where borrowers repay the entire sum at one go at the end of the tenure, means that one cannot predict a default till such a time.

Another problem faced by gold loan companies is the availability of low-cost funds. These firms had been on a growth spree as they had access to cheap funds from banks, which were allowed to fund NBFCs for lending against gold as part of priority sector lending activity. However, now that the RBI has excluded this category from priority sector lending, their source of low-cost funding has dried up.


	 
These companies are now forced to borrow at a much higher cost in the form of non-convertible debentures and bank credit lines, which has led to reduction in margins.
Should you invest? 

It is evident that gold loan companies don’t take kindly to a price fall. Even if defaults don’t rise sharply with every dip in gold price, the business is affected as the loan size also reduces in tandem with the value of gold. The revised RBI lending norms have also taken the sheen off the gold loan companies, with the customer base shrinking slightly.

The slashing of the LTV and the higher auction of gold jewellery have led to the decline in customer base. Says Ambareesh Baliga, a market expert: “The growth expectations for these companies will have to be tempered in line with the lower disbursements after the revised guidelines. Several brokerages have pruned the earnings estimates for gold loan companies for the fiscal year 2013.”
The credit profiles of these companies could also face a threat in case of a sustained fall in gold prices. With reference to Manappuram, Icra observes, “If the lenders were to become cautious and restrict access to these limits or hold back on fresh limits, the credit profile of the company could be adversely affected.”

However, some believe that the problems are not likely to persist since stringent lending norms have come into effect. A research note on Manappuram by Ambit Capital states, “Such instances of income reversal should not recur due to lower LTVs and interest rates on the loans issued after February 2012”, provided gold prices do not fall by more than 10 per cent within a year.

Unless you believe in the misplaced notion that gold prices are only meant to go up, it would be wise to limit the exposure to such firms."

The bonds will fund claims after a catastrophe like earthquake, or flood. These bonds help reinsurers transfer the financial risk of a catastrophe in a year to investors.
 
 GIC Re, the sole Indian reinsurer, has sought government’s permission for one such bond, said a person aware of the development. “We have written to the ministry on issuing ‘cat’ bonds in India,” said an executive of General Insurance Corporation. “We will approach the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority,” he said. GIC Re is attempting to establish itself as a bigger player in the international reinsurance business.
 
 It has been underwriting many global events in the past. For the company, it is a natural progression to launch what is popularly known as ‘cat bonds’. The ‘cat bond’ market size is more than $20 billion. The bonds, popular in the US, are generally priced 200 basis points above the 10-year US treasury yield.
 
 The price offered on ‘cat bonds’ is higher than corporate bonds as they carry junk status and investors run the risk of losing their entire sum. GIC will raise funds for a particular catastrophic risk like either earthquake or a tsunami or a cyclone with the condition that if the event happens, there will be no payout of interest or principal.
 
 But if the event does not happen, investors will get a higher yield than in other top-rated bonds. GIC saw a claim of Rs2,000 crore in Uttarakhand floods. It has not announced last fiscal’s result. In 2012-13, it had posted a profit ofRs2,345 crore against a loss of Rs2,469 crore in the previous year.
 
 GIC will be the first company to issue ‘cat bonds’ in India and is likely to benchmark them against the 10-year government securities. According to the Swiss Re Cat Bond Price Return Index, ‘cat bonds’ have returned 9.09 per cent in the nine months till September last. Large global reinsurance companies like AXA, Swiss Re sell ‘cat bonds’ to reinsure against catastrophes. Also, companies package various catastrophic risks and some even design products based on specific perils like storm, earthquake and flood."

As a first step, it has reclassified FTIL (Financial Technologies) and Multi-Commodity Stock Exchange as public shareholders. 

 At a meeting on February 13, the new board, constituted in the wake of the Rs 5,500-crore fraud at the FTIL subsidiary National Spot Exchange (NSEL), took the decision to reclassify the promoter shareholders. Shareholder director U Venkataraman has also stepped down from the board of MCX-SX. 

 When contacted, Saurabh Sarkar, MD & CEO, MCX Stock Exchange, said, “The Board has noted that Financial Technologies and MCX are not considered promoters and accordingly their shareholdings have been classified as public shareholding.” 

 He also said that U Venkatraman has resigned from the board of the exchange with effect from February 14, 2014, but will continue to act as MD & CEO of MCX-SX Clearing Corporation, asubsidiary of the exchange. 

 Also, the bourse, according to sources, has sought suggestions from its shareholders and well wishers on how to improve its brand image which has been impacted by controversies following the NSEL default. The exchange is considering a plan to rename the bourse. 

 While no decision has been taken to change the name, the proposal will be considered if shareholders and members feel the necessity. MCX-SX shareholders include IFCI (13.2%), Union Bank of India (11.47%) and IL&FS Financial Services (9.18%). Last October, Jignesh Shah and Joseph Massey stepped down as vice-chairman and MD of MCX-SX following direction from the regulator. 

 The MCX-SX board was reconstituted with the appointment of GK Pillai, former home secretary, as chairman; public interest director Thomas Mathew, former LIC chairman, as vice chairman; and Saurabh Sarkar, former MD & CEO of United Stock Exchange, was appointed as MD & CEO. While Prof Ashima Goyal and DR Dogra are on the board as public interest directors, U Venkataraman was the shareholder director. 

 The board is currently reviewing existing contracts and agreements at the exchange. In July 2012, market regulator Sebi, while allowing the exchange to offer trading platform for new asset classes like equity, had asked MCX and FTIL, which together hold 10% in MCXSX, to reduce their holding to 5% by January 18, 2014. MCX-SX’s recognition as a stock exchange for another year (beginning Sept 16) was renewed subject to the condition that no other regulator passed an adverse order against it. 

 Sebi had asked MCX-SX to constitute a committee of two independent directors and three institutional investor nominees to oversee key business decisions, policy matters and appointments of top management personnel. In December, Sebi sent a notice to FTIL, on why recognition of its suitability to run an exchange should not be withdrawn, following a similar notice from FMC."

 ""The Commission has received representations that the existing procedure for surrender of membership is cumbersome and time consuming. ...After detailed consultations with all the stakeholders and exchanges, the revised procedure for surrender of membership has been approved,"" FMC said in its latest circular. 

 As per the revised norms, once commodity bourses receive an application for surrender of membership from a member, they should advertise the same for public information and clients' complaints, if any, within one month from the date of receipt of such application. 

 Advertisements should be published in at least one national-level newspaper and one local newspaper which is widely circulated in the locality in which the member concerned is located. 

 Further, the exchange should ensure as far as possible that the application of surrender of membership is informed to the clients of the concerned member by way of text message or emails. 

 The exchange should provide 60 days for receiving complaints against the member after the date of publication of the advertisement. And the exchange should redress complaints, if any against the member within 60 days of receipt of such complaints. 

 After processing redressal of all the complaints against the member, if the exchange considers the case eligible for surrender, the exchange should intimate the regulator of the same within 15 days. 

 If no communication is received by the exchange from the regulator within 30 days of such intimation, the exchange can approve the request of surrender of membership and should refund all the deposits of the member within three months of the date of intimation to the regulator. 

 List of the members whose request of surrender has been approved by the exchange, along with date of approval, should be widely published by posting the same on the website of the exchange.

FMC unveils uniform warehouse accreditation norms for bourses,"{""FMC"": ""neutral"", ""bourses"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fmc-unveils-uniform-warehouse-accreditation-norms-for-bourses/articleshow/45247699.cms,m.economictimes.com,FMC unveils uniform warehouse accreditation norms for bourses,"NEW DELHI: The Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has come out with uniform norms for giving accreditation to warehouse services providers by commodity exchanges, a step to inspire confidence among market participants. 

 This will also strengthen warehouse facilities in the commodity futures market. It assumes significance in the backdrop of Rs 5,600-crore payment scam at NSEL which exposed the poor warehousing monitoring. 

 FMC has directed the national level bourses to follow the new norms by March 31, 2015. It has also asked the bourses not to allow existing warehouse services providers to operate beyond June 30, 2015, according to a circular issued by the commodity markets regulator. 

 Commodity exchanges at present follow different norms and standards while giving accreditation to warehouses on their platform. 

 ""This is for the first time that the FMC has framed uniform norms for accreditation of WSPs (warehouse services providers) to ensure credibility of warehouses and the warehousing receipts issued by them. It is necessary that the WSPs accredited by exchanges inspire confidence among the market participants,"" a senior FMC official told PTI. 

 As per new norms, the exchanges can give recognise warehouses having a minimum networth of Rs 25 crore. However, for warehouses providing services for single commodity at a particular location, the minimum networth requirement may be relaxed to Rs 10 crore. 

 Warehouses should be in the public same business for last at least three years. Their promoters should have a good business reputation and credibility, says the circular. 

 That apart, warehouses are also required to furnish a security deposit in the range of 3-5 per cent of the value of the goods worth up to Rs 500 crore in the warehouse. 

 To ensure good corporate governance, FMC said: ""Management of WSP or entities owned or controlled by management of WSP/Group concerns or persons 'acting in concert' shall not be allowed to trade on the commodity exchange in the commodity for which it is accredited by exchange."" 

 FMC further said that warehouses should have a professional management team to oversee its functioning and operations. They should submit a networth certification and financial statements to exchange every six months. 

 Warehouses should also have a 'Customer Grievance Cell' and comply with 'Know Your Depositor Policy' from time to time. 

 While giving accreditation to warehouses, exchanges should see if warehouses have infrastructure facilities for proper handling and storage of commodities. 

 Warehouses are required to insurance cover of the stock stored in the warehouses, periodic audit of the stock, electronic record of the information of the warehouses among other. 

 The exchanges are also directed to make suitable amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations as required for the implementation of these norms, the FMC said. 

 There are four national and six regional level exchanges operating in the country."

 Termed a ""game changer"" by Ramesh Abhishek, chairman, FMC, these contracts will allow traders to buy commodities like chana, rapeseed mustard, castorseed, etc, on commodity exchanges, where currently they can’t do so. This, Abhishek feels, could increase delivery by physical market traders on the six national bourses, which posted volumes ofRs 101-lakh crore in the fiscal year through March.
 
 Market estimation of delivery on the bourses is just 2-3% of annual volumes, with a larger portion being because of speculation and hedging.
 
 ""The contracts will be centre-based,"" said Abhishek. ""Modalities of the contracts are being worked out by the exchanges. We are encouraging them to launch products that result in greater proportion of delivery.""
 
 Currently, on the futures market, say a chana trader who wants delivery of the pulse at Bikaner, places an order to buy. However, at the contract expiry, which usually happens on the 20th of a month, he realises the chana delivered is from another centre, say, Delhi. The quality and price of this chana differs from that in Bikaner. This may dissuade a trader from buying or selling on the futures market.
 
 FMC and the exchanges feel centre-specific forward contracts could address the demand from such market constituents.
 
 Atul Chaturvedi, CEO, Adani Wilmar, which handles 2.5-million tonnes of edible oils across the country and is known for the Fortune brand of cooking oil, agreed that such contracts could ""facilitate"" and ""improve"" deliveries on the bourses. ""Traders such as ourselves would get to know how much of a commodity is dematerialised (held in electronic form) and that would help,"" Chaturvedi said.
 
 However, Pukhraj Chopra, a grain merchant at Bikaner, said success of the proposed contracts would depend on their cost competitiveness to forwards executed between traders outside the exchange infrastructure. ""I pay just a brokerage cost for such a trade outside of the bourses.
 
 If I have to pay warehouse and grading and assaying charges, I would not use such contracts,"" Chopra said.
 
 Dilip Bhatia, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank-promoted Ace Commodity Exchange said the finer points were being thrashed out by the exchanges.
 
 However, FMC’s Abhishek feels traders would be assured of reliability, quality of produce and assured delivery that would negate concerns of traders like Chopra in the long run.
 
 A futures and forwards contract are similar to the extent that both allow a buyer or a seller to buy/sell a commodity at a predetermined price at a future date. However, a few differences exist. For instance, in a futures market, the counterparty is anonymous, while a forwards contract is struck between two parties known to each other. But, unlike in an OTC forwards contract, in the futures market, the counterparty default risk is borne by the exchange, a plus point when forwards are launched on the exchanges.

 ""We are looking at proposed modification in corporate governance, which needs to be transparent and strong. We are examining the shareholding pattern of exchanges and the role of anchor investor,"" FMC Chairman Ramesh Abhishek said here on the sidelines of Pulses Conclave 2014 here. 

 The plans follows the FMC decision wherein Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) was deemed ""not fit and proper"" to run the Multi Commodity Exchange and the regulator ordered the reduction in FTIL stake to less than 2 per cent in MCX from the current level of 26 per cent. 

 The new round of proposals are being contemplated after the Rs 5,600-crore payment crisis at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) promoted by Financial Technologies. NSEL has stopped trading on its platform since August. 

 FMC and the government are contemplating capping shareholding of anchor investors in commodity exchanges to 15 per cent or even lower. 

 Also, in a move to achieve a diversified shareholding, the policy-makers plan to simplify rules on transfer of shares and relax restrictions on shareholders from trading on the bourse platform. 

 The regulator is also considering having a single depository for all the commodity exchanges. 

 ""We are examining that the clearing functions even without amendment of FCRA can be done by a common entity,"" Abhishek said, adding that FCRA amendment provides for setting up of a clearing corporation. 

 Post-NSEL crisis, capital market regulator Sebi has instructed CDSL and NSDL to stay away from clearing commodity trade. 

 NCDEX, which was using the services of CDSL, recently launched its own in-house depository resulting in lower cost for traders. 

 Commenting on how commodity exchanges can manage with a single clearing house when equity exchanges such as BSE and NSE have separate clearing corporation, Abhishek said: ""There are challenges, but the objective is to work out a solution for having a unified clearing corporation."" 

 The regulator is also increasing the staff strength and setting up a bigger office, he added."

 He however, said the hearing on petition challenging FMC order is coming up for hearing at the Bombay High Court tomorrow. 

 Sebi officials could not be reached for comments. Today's meeting followed a show cause notice issued by Sebi to Financial Technologies and others last month, soon after on December 18 commodities market regulator Forwards Markets Commission had said the group, its promoter Shah as well as senior executive Joseph Massey were not fit and proper to run any exchange. 

 The indictment came following a probe the FMC had conducted into the Rs 5,600 crore scam at the group promoted spot exchange NSEL which was shut since July 30 following trading of unlicensed forward instruments. 

 Sebi meeting relates to their 'fit and proper' status to run the group promoted stock exchange MCX-SX. 

 The FTIL group will have to reduce its shareholding in the stock exchange substantially if Sebi too declares the group and the promoter not 'fit and proper'.

Are Europe-focused funds a good bet?,"{""Europe-focused funds"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/are-europe-focused-funds-a-good-bet/articleshow/29703481.cms,m.economictimes.com,Are Europe-focused funds a good bet?,"In the past few years, several international funds have been launched in India to take advantage of the market conditions abroad. In 2012 and 2013, the funds focused on the US were offered to capture the revival in that market. Now, with Europe poised for a turnaround, funds concentrating on this region are coming in the market. Religare Invesco Pan European Equity fund, JP Morgan European Dynamic Equity, and DWS Top Euroland Offshore are three such funds available now.

Why invest in Europe? 

The European equity markets appear attractive because the economy in the region is poised for a turnaround this year after a severe recession in the past few years. “The European economy contracted in 2012 and had zero growth in 2013.

It will probably grow 1-1.5% in 2014. Equity markets love situations where the macroeconomic environment is turning from negative to positive,” says Nandkumar Surti, CEO and MD, JP Morgan Asset Management. When the equity markets rise from depressed valuations of a recession, investors’ gains tend to be dramatic.

Corporate balance sheets within Europe are strengthening and the level of leverage is coming down, while retail spending is gathering momentum. Signs of international investors gaining confidence in the region are also evident.

Recently, Ireland, which had received a bailout package and then undergone fiscal consolidation, managed to raise $3.8 billion via a 10-year euro bond issue at 3.5%, a rate only marginally higher than that Germany would have paid.

Thus, investors are beginning to reward countries that have mended their finances.
Europe is one of the world’s largest economic blocs, accounting for 19% of the world GDP and home to 160 of Fortune 500 companies. An investor diversifying internationally can’t overlook this region.

The low correlation between the European and Indian markets also provides a good rationale.

When you invest in a market that has low correlation with the home market, your portfolio is better diversified. Moreover, the valuations of cyclical and financial stocks, and of those in peripheral European markets, are still low compared with historical averages and hold the potential to offer large gains.

The Europe-focused funds can be a vehicle for gaining exposure to global markets. “Many of the companies domiciled in Europe operate in markets across the globe and, hence, are not a play on the European economy alone,” says Vetri Subramanian, chief investment officer, Religare Invesco Mutual Fund.

What’s being offered?

The Religare Invesco Pan European Equity fund is a fund of funds (FoF) that will invest primarily in Invesco Pan European Equity fund. The mother fund has a 23-year track record, with the same pair of fund managers at the helm for the past 10.

The JP Morgan European Dynamic Equity Offshore fund is an FoF, whose mother fund, JPM Europe Dynamic, is a ‘best ideas fund’.

The fund managers are not constrained by sector, benchmark or geography. The fund has existed for 13 years and its current three managers have been there for the past eight years.

The DWS Top Euroland Offshore fund is not an NFO. From 9 January, the DWS Global Thematic Offshore fund has become DWS Top Euroland Offshore.

The mother fund changed from DWS Invest Global Thematic to DWS Invest Top Euroland.


	 
Risks and drawbacks

Investing in an international fund, including Europe-focused funds, carries a few risks, including the one stemming from currency. “At present, the returns from the US and European markets look attractive primarily because of the depreciation of the rupee,” says Rattan Chugh, director, Cornerstone Portfolio Services, a Gurgaon-based financial planning firm.

Having fallen about 35% over the past two-and-a-half years, and with the current account deficit under control, depreciation of a similar magnitude is unlikely to be repeated in the near future. Besides, international funds are taxed at par with debt funds. They don’t enjoy the favourable tax treatment that equity funds do. These FoFs also levy a 1% exit load if you redeem before 18 months. Invest in them only if you have a horizon of three to five years.

Who should invest and how much?

First, gain adequate exposure to all the asset classes in India. “Only high net worth individuals (HNIs) with adequate exposure to Indian assets, who want to diversify and are highly informed, should venture into Europe-focused funds,” says Prasunjit Mukherjee, a Kolkata-based mutual fund analyst. Depending on their risk appetites, HNIs should invest 15-20% of their equity assets in international funds.

Split this allocation between developed and developing markets, with a higher allocation to the former (due to lower correlation). Invest more in the US market, whose longterm growth prospects are likely to be better than that of Europe. About 30-40% of the developed market allocation can be to Europefocused funds."

	Broad based dollar strength weighed on the euro as dollar-yen kept making fresh session highs and the euro-yen was forced to a high of Y139.96 from a morning low of Y139.64 before retracing to Y139.77 last. Euro bulls would need to try clear reported offers at $1.3640 & $1.3655 and a close above the 200-dma ($1.3648), further offers are reported at $1.3670/80 with stops above $1.3680.

	EUR/USD: The $1.3647-69 resistance region remains key this week with bulls needing a close above to confirm an easing of bearish pressure and see immediate focus shift back to the 21, 55 & 100-DMA's clustered in the $1.3687-1.3768 region. 


	For now the pair continues to hover precariously above the $1.3586 May 29 low after having failed to close back above the 200-DMA on recent attempts. While $1.3645-69 caps bears are targeting fresh 2014 lows. 


	Yen Summary: Dollar-yen started at Y102.51 in Asia Wednesday, retracing from NY's high of Y102.56 and continued its bullish tone with Japanese names paying up the pair in early session. 


	Strong dollar demand erased the Y102.50 barrier option easily, forcing the rate up to Y102.67 after it cleared offers at Y102.60 which was supported by a Japanese securities house aggressive buying on talks of a takeover deal by the Dai-ichi Life Insurance for Protective Life, worth $5.7 bln. 


	Stronger USD index and firmer UST yields boosted dollar-yen further to hit an Asian high of Y102.81, stops were triggered above Y102.75 while exporters offers were noted from Y102.75/80 levels and further offers/stops are noted at/above Y103.00.

	Overall a close back below the Y101.89 level is needed to confirm an end to bullish hopes and see bears looking for closes below the 200-DMA to add weight to the bearish case. 


	EUR/JPY: Tuesday's move higher saw the pair close above the 21-DMA which adds support to the bullish case and sees immediate focus shift to layers of resistance in the Y140.27-99 region where key moving averages are located. Overall bulls need a close above the Y140.99 May 13 high to end bearish hopes and target 2014 highs. 


	Bears now need a close below the Y139.36 support to signal a false break higher and target last week's low. 


	Australian Dollar Summary: Aussie dollar had a mixed day Wednesday with much of the positive coming from the stronger than expected Q1 GDP data, which came in at +1.1% qoq and +3.5% yoy (vs. MNI Median at +1.0% and +3.3%). Aussie had been quietly sliding lower all morning until the release, but immediately jumped from $0.9260 to $0.9299, where sellers emerged off the level where, on Monday, the weaker April Building Approvals data had seen the market plummet. 


	Further analysis and Economist commentary focused on the +0.9% added by mining exports, with a weaker picture in the backdrop. After looking to consolidate at the $0.9280 level, the pair slipped in lunchtime trade as the USD rose against the majors, with the pair eventually back to the $0.9260 mark where it had all began. 


	 

	However, the overall picture remains that GDP growth, wherever it has come from, is at +3.5%, and inflation is on the high side of the RBA's target range. AUD began a slow climb back to it's current level of $0.9271, up just 5bps on the day, midpoint of the $0.9253/0.9299 range for the day. 


	Sterling Summary: Cable closed in NY Tuesday at $1.6749 after rate had corrected back from early session highs of $1.6782 to $1.6731. Rate recovered to $1.6756 into the London fix before it settled around $1.6750 into the close. 


	Cable marked highs in early Asian trade at $1.6752 before turning lower as strong demand for dollar-yen emerged, which in turn prompted general dollar strength. Cable eased to an initial low of $1.6720, recovered to $1.6730 before extending lows to $1.6719 ahead of the European open. Rate currently trades around $1.6724.


	Euro-sterling, which had seen a sharp bounce off lows of stg0.8105 to stg0.8148 on reported ECB fix demand Tuesday, consolidated this move between stg0.81345-0.8142 in Asia. UK services PMI (0830GMT) the morning domestic focus with EZ GDP and PPI following at 0900GMT. 


	However, trade expected to remain range bound ($1.6693-1.6782) ahead of Thursday's ECB rate/monetary policy announcement.

Resistance $1.6752 (50% $1.6782-19; $1.6758 61.8%; $1.6767 76.4%), with stronger interest at $1.6782 (Jun3 high/50-dma). Euro-sterling in an outside range of stg0.8080/0.8170. 


	GBP/USD: Cable is starting to look a little heavy following Tuesday's failed rally with the $1.6785 level now seen as initial resistance. Layers of resistance are noted in the 1.6815-81 region which should slow any further rallies for now as bearish focus firmly dominates. Bears remain focused on the 100-DMA and a break below which then targets March and April monthly lows. 


	Dollar-Asia Summary: Dollar regional currencies remain supported in Asian session after further short covering during US session, while regional stocks snapped yesterday's gains. Stronger dollar index, UST yields & dollar-yen further boosted USD/Asia FX ahead of Thursday ECB meeting and Friday US nonfarm payrolls data.

DTC will not impact foreign investor fund inflows,"{""DTC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/dtc-will-not-impact-foreign-investor-fund-inflows/articleshow/6056714.cms,m.economictimes.com,DTC will not impact foreign investor fund inflows,"
  MUMBAI: Foreign portfolio investors will not be materially impacted by the proposed changes in the new tax code, as long as these funds are able to claim tax credit in their home jurisdictions, say experts. 
  
  Another factor likely to mitigate the impact of the new tax rule is that India remains one of the fastest growing economies globally, and is likely to attract a sizeable chunk of the flows coming out of other troubled markets.
  
  The proposed rule seeks to tax foreign portfolio investors’ revenues from equity investments in India under capital gains tax, instead of under business income. 
  
  Business income is income that arises from the regular operations of a company, and hence are taxed at a lower rate. Capital gains are those that arise out of the sale of assets such as land, gold or in the case of FIIs-equity holdings, and hence attract a higher tax.
  
  “The rule is likely to impact very few foreign funds,” says Sukumar Rajah, MD & CIO-Asian Equities, Franklin Templeton Investments.
  
  Suresh Swamy, ED, Financial Services, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has similar views. “As of today, there is only a small universe of FIIs which claim their income to be business income. Most of them adopt a capital gains stand. FIIs/sub-accounts were entitled to claim treaty benefits only if they satisfied certain conditions. Not all of them satisfied those conditions,” he says.
  
  Mauritius-based institutions continue to be taxed under Mauritius laws, which exempt them from capital gains tax. India has a taxation treaty with Mauritius which is used to save on tax by foreign funds.
  
  “For those who come in from a treaty jurisdiction, there would be little or no impact at all. But those who were from non-treaty jurisdictions and were relying on this being categorised as business income, could be impacted,” says Siddharth Shah, head-funds practice, Nishith Desai Associates. 
  
  “It’s ironical in some sense that such change combined with higher tax rate on capital gains may actually investors push to look at investing through treaty jurisdictions with capital gains benefits,” he says.
  
  He, however, cautions investors that one needs to watch out for GAAR provisions and applicability of the same to structures. “While the draft has removed the treaty override provisions proposed under the old draft, one will get a clear picture only when detailed GAAR rules are announced,” he told ET.
  
  Shefali Goradia, partner, BMR Advisors, believes it is aspirational for the government to curb treaty shopping by invoking GAAR. “Most other countries have not succeeded in doing this. If the tax officers challenge the Mauritius treaty due to lack of substance, this can be challenged before the courts,” she adds.
  
  Punit Shah, ED-tax & regulatory services (financial services) KPMG says that the certainty of availability of the capital gains tax exemption under Mauritius tax treaty is crucial for foreign investors. 
  
  “Even though, the discussion paper provides for beneficial provisions of the treaty to prevail, it is subject to passing anti-abuse provision tests, the application of which itself is not objectively provided for. This brings uncertainty and subjectivity in applying the beneficial tax treaty provisions,” he said.

Pramod Bhasin to head DLF's rental business,"{""DLF"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/pramod-bhasin-to-head-dlfs-rental-business/articleshow/29517273.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pramod Bhasin to head DLF's rental business,"By: Raviteja Sharma 

 NEW DELHI: Pramod Bhasin, the man who set up General Electric’s outsourcing business to India, is being appointed as the chairman of the rental business of DLF, the country’s biggest builder, as the latter plans to consolidate its rental assets into Rentco and list it as a REIT or real estate investment trust in the future. 

 A REIT is a type of security that is sold like a stock on an exchange and invests and owns real estate assets that produce a stable rental income for shareholders. The advent of REITs will give builders an opportunity to monetise their income-producing assets. 

 DLF’s assets generate rents worth Rs2,000 crore a year and a new company owning these assets could be valued at around Rs20,000 crore at least, according to top executives of the company. Bhasin set up GE Capital International Services or Gecis, renamed Genpact, in Gurgaon after DLF promoter KP Singh convinced the then GE boss Jack Welch to start outsourcing work from the US to India. Bhasin was inducted onto the DLF board as a non-executive independent director in August last year. “The company now wants to leverage his experience in the BPO, outsourcing and IT businesses to make the rental business a self-sustaining model, by either taking it for an IPO or listing it as a REIT,” said one of the executives cited above.
 
 
  
 Most of DLF’s 25 million sq ft of leased assets, which include offices and malls, have been rented to IT and outsourcing entities. 

 A spokesman for DLF said, “Bhasin joined us a few months ago as an independent director on the board of DLF. Since he comes from the IT/ ITeS background, we look forward to his guidance in all aspects of business.” 

 He declined to share details. Bhasin could not be reached for comment. The company’s board is likely to take up the appointment of Bhasin at its next meeting, both the sources said. 

 After spending over 25 years at GE, Bhasin set up an in-house BPO division Gecis in 1997. Gecis took up space in offices set up by DLF. Around that time, other technology firms and large MNCs began outsourcing business to India, and much of this investment came to Gurgaon. DLF was a big beneficiary of this trend as it was already building offices and homes in the area. 

 Over the past few years, DLF has categorised its businesses into two segments — development side, which is in the business of building and selling assets such as homes, and rental side, which builds and leases out assets such as offices and malls. “Going forward the company wants to make the two independent of each other so that they both generate their own free cash,” said one of the sources. Bhasin’s entry is being seen as part of the process of making the rental business an independent vertical within DLF. 

 Almost 80 per cent of the rental assets are housed in a company called DLF Cyber City Developers while some others, mostly malls, are in other companies. Over the course of the next two years, all rental assets will be merged into one entity that will be spun off as a listed company or as a REIT as and when the government puts in place a tax code for the new instrument. 

 Worldwide, REITs get special tax considerations. In India, stock market regulator Sebi recently issued draft guidelines for REITs, after having put the move on hold in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. “After the new government enacts a tax code for REITs in line with those applicable globally, we will decide which way to go,” said one company executive."

 The 30-share BSE benchmark ended at 21,209.73 today. The Sensex is trading at 14x (in line with long-term average), and we expect 15 per cent EPS growth for Sensex in FY15. We have a Sensex target of 24,000 for December, at which Sensex will trade at 15.8x, in line with average of past five years, Deutsche said in a report.
 
 This is in line with the MSCI India which is also trading at 14.1x, while its premium to MSCI Asia-ex-Japan has come down marginally to 29 per cent from 32 per cent in January, the report said.
 
 The Indian market outperformed most of its key emerging market (EM) peers like Thailand and Indonesia in February, with the Sensex rising 3 per cent in the month and 1 per cent YTD for the year, it said.
 
 Deutsche said the market is driven by decreasing likelihood of a fractured verdict in the general elections, both WPI and CPI inflation dipping by more than 100 bps in January MoM and improving global risk appetite.
 
 In dollar terms, the Sensex was among the top performing indices globally as the rupee appreciated 1.5 per cent on improving risk sentiment for EM assets.
 
 The BSE capital goods index was the top performing sector (+9.4 per cent), followed by autos (+8.9 per cent) and healthcare (+7.2 per cent), while key underperformers were metals (-5.4 per cent), realty (-0.7 per cent), FMCG (-0.5 per cent) and oil & gas (-0.3 per cent).
 
 The report pointed out that in February, fiscal discipline continued, vote-on-account desisted from populism and diesel prices hiked despite concerns to contrary.
 
 In the interim Budget, the Government commendably desisted from populist measures (like farm loan waiver in an election year), endorsing commitment to fiscal consolidation.
 
 Similarly, the latest diesel price hike announced last week sent a strong signal that calibrated fuel price rationalisation will continue, the brokerage said.

ET Now: Do you think the secular rally in cyclical is over, just about everything and anything has gone up irrespective of the pedigree, irrespective of the market capitalisation, we have seen a strong appreciation of about 40% or 50% in just about every cyclical, do you think it is the time to differentiate now and that easy money in cyclicals has been made? 

 
Nitin Raheja: Yes, I clearly believe so and that is what the broader market seems to be indicating. We have seen this huge hope-driven, expectation-driven rally and now market seems to be showing some sort of a reality check. So, you had a case where a lot of the stocks were undervalued and they were completely out of flavour. From the bottoms you have seen them come up to a level where they are looking for something concrete in terms of fundamentals to start showing up before they make their next move."
Crude reserves filling to begin after March 2016,"{""Crude"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/crude-reserves-filling-to-begin-after-march-2016/articleshow/50114732.cms,m.economictimes.com,Crude reserves filling to begin after March 2016,"NEW DELHI: The process of filling India’s two new strategic petroleum reserves could begin only after March as pipelines connecting the caverns to the port are yet to be laid, a top executive of state-run Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve (ISPRL) has said. 

 India, which imports 80% of its crude oil requirement, has built three strategic reserves to store crude oil that could help guard against potential energy supply disruption. A sharp drop in crude oil prices has been another incentive for the country to quickly build and fill these reserves before prices start rising again. Benchmark Brent and US crude futures are now trading near $40 a barrel. 

 Its first reserve in Vishakhapatnam with a storage capacity of 1.3 million tonne (mt) has already been filled at a cost of Rs 2,700 crore. The other two reserves at Mangalore and Padur in Karnataka, with a combined capacity of 4 mt, too are ready to take crude oil but the proposed pipelines connecting them with the landfall point are yet to be laid, delaying the project by a further six months. 

 The pipelines, long delayed due to landowners’ protest, will now be ready by March, said the ISPRL executive, requesting anonymity. 

 ISPRL is responsible for building and managing these reserves that could act as a buffer for more than a month in case oil supplies to the country are disrupted. The government also plans to build four more reserves with a combined capacity of 12.5 mt in the second phase. 

 The executive said the deadlock with landowners was resolved after the company agreed to pay them a higher compensation for right of use. Laying pipelines have been contentious in India as farmers and companies can’t quickly agree on compensation and local politics further vitiates the atmosphere, delaying projects for years and putting investments at risk. 

 ISPRL needs to lay a 12.8 km pipeline between the port and the Mangalore cavern, of which about 8.6 km has been laid so far. Barely half a kilometer of pipeline has been built on the 36-km segment between the valve station and the Padur Cavern."
Crisil launches first inflation-linked government securities index,"{""Crisil"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/crisil-launches-first-inflation-linked-government-securities-index/articleshow/42804043.cms,m.economictimes.com,Crisil launches first inflation-linked government securities index,"MUMBAI: Largest domestic credit rating agency Crisil Research today launched the country's first inflation indexed government securities index (Crisil IIGS Index), which will track the performance of a portfolio of inflation-linked government securities.  	Crisil believes the index will provide market participants an appropriate and easily accessible benchmark to measure and analyse the performance of such securities, the agency said in a statement.  	That apart, this total return index seeks to capture returns on inflation-linked securities due to coupon accruals and price change, both adjusted for inflation.  	The launch comes as part of Crisil's ongoing effort to develop and maintain representative indices for the debt market. In addition to this index, the agency currently maintains 37 indices across bond, gilts, money market, hybrid and commodity segments, which are used by asset managers for benchmarking their products and portfolios.  	Agency president Mukesh Agarwal said: ""The launch of the index further endorses the agency's status as a pioneer in debt and hybrid indices in the country. This index is expected to serve both as a benchmark and underlying index for investment products such as index funds.  	""Crisil will continue to develop indices that help market participants gauge the performance of different asset classes and make investment decisions in an otherwise shallow debt market,"" he said.  	Currently, there is one such security, the 1.44 per cent inflation indexed government stock 2023 (linked to wholesale price index) issued in June 2013. Such securities provide inflation protection on both principal and coupon (interest) payments.  	It may be noted that the agency already provides daily valuation of government securities, including mutual funds for determination of net asset value of funds, to investors.  	Senior director for capital markets Sandeep Sabharwal said, ""We believe the Crisil IIGS Index will meet the need for an appropriate benchmark index for these funds.""  	He further noted that since its launch in 2013, the inflation-linked government security has gained some popularity in the mutual funds space. Two inflation-linked funds have already been launched and a few are in the pipeline."

 The company also expects to turn profitable in two years. ""The online real estate segment is growing rapidly, mainly due to the penetration of internet and increase in usage of smartphones...to further expand our business, we might go public in the next 3-5 years,"" company's Co-founder and CEO Sumit Jain told PTI here. 

 He did not, however, disclose how much the company expects to raise. 

 ""We have been raising funds through various investors and utilising it for creating new products, investing in technology and data gathering. We will be further investing in these three areas to make the platform more robust,"" he said, adding the venture will turn profitable in next two years. 

 The company recently launched two services including CF Retina, which gives virtual experience of the property, and live-in tours in which customers can take a complete virtual tour of the property. 

 ""We plan to roll out live in tours in 17 more cities in the next one month. We currently have 15,000 properties listed through live-in tours and plans to list five lakh rental and resale units under the virtual tour feature in the next six months,"" Jain said. 

 The company has about 10 million homes across 200 cities listed on its portal. 

 The Bengaluru-based firm has so far raised over USD 60 million from Accel Partners, Tiger Global and Google Capital. 

 ""We are looking to turn profitable in the next two years. About 220,000 properties are listed on the site every month. We are well capitalised and have over half of the money raised till now in the bank. We believe in spending on innovation development which enhances customer experience,"" he said. 

 Last year, the company had acquired Flat.to, a real estate service that helps students and bachelors find flats, paying guest accommodation and hostels across Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Kota, Jaipur and Delhi. 

 With the acquisition Commonfloor.com could cater to a new segment -- students and bachelors, Jain said."
Commodities futures now part of supply chain,"{""Commodities futures"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/commodities-futures-now-part-of-supply-chain/articleshow/7567243.cms,m.economictimes.com,Commodities futures now part of supply chain,"MUMBAI: The quantity of farm and precious metal products delivered on commodity bourses NCDEX and MCX last year increased by over 36% and 20%, respectively, from a year ago, according to ETIG data. This shows that large trading houses, food, bullion and metal companies are using the seven-year-old market for raw material trading.
  
  While most companies are reluctant to reveal their risk management practices, most believe it is a good development. “Rising deliveries are a good sign..... we need commodity exchanges for the orderly development of the markets. Their role in price discovery helps farmers take a decision on sowing based on the best realisation available for a particular crop. That said, I think the exchange needs to align its delivery mechanism for soyabean and soya oil with that for mustard seed, which has witnessed the highest delivery last year,” said Atul Chaturvedi, CEO of Adani Wilmar, manufacturer of the Fortune brand of edible oil, and a hedger on NCDEX.
  
  Attracted by the rise in volumes in commodity futures, some companies buying raw materials from physical market are now willing to look at the option of taking a membership in a commodity board.
  
  “Future Agrovet, which sources all agri commodity requirements for Future Group stores, is evaluating the opportunity of trading on local commodity exchanges as part of our treasury function,” said Damodar Mall, director (food strategy), Future Group, India’s largest retailer. “We are not interested in buying from or selling on the exchanges... but since we have an underlying exposure, we may consider covering the same.” 
  
  Top jewellery companies say bullion futures enable them to better manage their risk amid increased volatility in the metals. “What I buy on the physical market, I sell on the exchange and what I sell to a retailer, I buy on the exchange,” said Umesh Shah, vice president (domestic jewellery division) Shrenuj & Co. “So, if the price rises or falls, I gain in one market and lose in the other, in effect neutralising my price risk. If used wisely, this facility can benefit corporates.” Apart from actual users, increased participation by high net-worth clients is also said to be one of the reasons for deliveries trending up not just in gold but also in a few agri counters, according to Jayant Manglik, president, Religare Commodities. 
  
  “Apart from bullion, HNI clients are steadily learning the intricacies of trading in farm products, factors like seasonality and validity of stocks. Equipped with this knowledge they can buy cheap on the spot market and deliver on the futures market or vice versa and earn a neat spread,” said Manglik."

Commexes extended trade hours hit a roadblock,"{""Commexes"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/commexes-extended-trade-hours-hit-a-roadblock/articleshow/34706730.cms,m.economictimes.com,Commexes’ extended trade hours hit a roadblock,"MUMBAI: Commodity exchanges like NCDEX and Kotak-promoted Ace may be facing a potential hurdle to their plans of increasing volumes by launching extended trade hours in select farm products since the past month. 

 Forward Markets Commission (FMC), which regulates commodity futures trading, has asked the six national-level bourses led by NCDEX for a report on the socalled “evening trade” that began in April after having received complaints from vegetable oil trading bodies, a commodity exchange official said. The nub of the argument of oil associations like Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), which represents companies such as Ruchi Soya and Adani Wilmar, and Central Organisation of Oil Industry and Trade (COOIT) is that increased trading hours in itself won’t help the exchanges attract more participation and raise volumes. 

 Physical markets close at 5 pm and continuation of futures trading after that would deform the market as no physical trade takes place after business hours, they contended. “Understandably, the objective of extended trade timing may be increased volumes at the domestic exchanges,” Vijay Data, president of SEA, wrote in a letter to FMC. 

 “However, until the banking hours are extended to match/honour the trades, the element of hedging by the trade participants would decrease and the element of speculation may go on an incremental trend, which may not be in the bona fide interest of the stakeholders in general,” he wrote. Ramesh Abhishek, chairman of FMC, could not be reached for comment. 

 The reason the commission allowed extended trade hours from 5 pm to 11:30 pm from Monday through Friday was to enable genuine users to hedge their positions in farm commodities with international linkages like soya oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, sugar and cotton in line with users of gold, silver, base metals and energy. 

 According to some commodity market brokers, the real reason for the trade bodies’ grouse was their loss of pricing power. A transparent and national-level pricing mechanism disseminated through the futures market would diminish processors’ hold on prices, they said. 

 Justifying extended trading, an NCDEX official said, “In case of price movement in international markets after domestic bourses closed, market participants here were not in aposition to manage their cash market position and the price risk associated with fluctuation in price, as the formal markets were closed. They were exposed to the risk of a price gap opening on the domestic markets the following day.” This person contended that evening trading has greatly reduced the basic risk of local players by facilitating more efficient alignment of the domestic prices with the international prices. 

 In their complaint to FMC, trade bodies have also contended that internationally, exchanges like Bursa Malaysia, the benchmark for palm oil, and China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange, one of the benchmarks for soya bean and soya oil, operate for five and four hours, respectively. In contrast, exchanges like NCDEX operated currently for 13.5 hours, from 10 am to 11.30 pm, which was stretching the financial and physical resources of traders. 

 Brokers such as Suresh Nair of Admisi Commodities and Viral Shah of Geojit Comtrade, however, said electronic platforms of exchanges such as Globex, another benchmark for soya bean, remained open for virtually 24 hours, making the industry’s contention of exchanges operating for only a few hours not entirely correct."

Coffee Day IPO: Should you subscribe or avoid?,"{""Coffee Day"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coffee-day-ipo-should-you-subscribe-or-avoid/articleshow/49334515.cms,m.economictimes.com,Coffee Day IPO: Should you subscribe or avoid?,"NEW DELHI: Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL) owns the coffee chain – Café Coffee Day, which as a brand is not new to you and me and can very well be a good play to ride India’s rising consumption story.
 
 The company also has diversified business interests through 40 subsidiaries across segments like logistics, financial services, hospitality and technology parks.
 
 Over the years, the company has been successful in creating a strong brand on its own without any international tieup. Its market share in terms of number of chained café outlets stood at 46 per cent as of December 31, 2014, brokerage Angel Broking said in a report.
 
 The initial public offering of Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL) to raise Rs 1,150 crore opened for subscription on Wednesday. The price band of the issue has been fixed at Rs 316-328 a share. The issue will close on Friday, October 16.
 
 The entire issue is of fresh equity issue, and the company will use the proceeds to (a) finance the expansion of its coffee business; (b) repay and pre-pay loans for the parent as well as subsidiaries; and (c) meet general corporate needs.
 
 Currently, the promoters hold 63.3 per cent in the company, which will come down to 52.6 per cent post-issue at the upper end of the price band at Rs 328.
 
 Most brokerage firms believe the valuations are somewhat expensive and a bit stretched, but it can be a good stock to play the consumption story. Investors who have a mid-term to long-term horizon can look at subscribing to the issue.
 
 One of the reasons why some of the brokerage firms like the IPO is the fact that it would be a direct play on India’s rising consumption story. “Led by the confluence of rising income levels, rich demographic profile and increasing aspirations, the share of spending in the discretionary category is likely to improve,” brokerage Sharekhan said in a report.
 
 Retailing consultant Technopak said the size of the organised café market is estimated to be Rs 6,700 crore in 2014 and is projected to grow to Rs 15,100 crore by 2020, rising at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 per cent.
 
 
We have collated the views of various brokerage firms on Coffee Day IPO:
 
 

 
 
Angel Broking: Neutral 
 
 Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL), on a consolidated basis, reported 30 per cent CAGR growth in revenue over FY2010-15 to Rs 2,479cr. On the Ebitda front, the company reported a 26 per cent growth CAGR over the same period.
 
 “CDEL has diversified across various businesses, which however have failed to deliver impressive financial performances so far. Considering negligible profits/reported losses of subsidiaries and the complex holding structure of the company, we are of the view that the IPO is priced at a slightly higher valuation,” the brokerage said.
 
 “Thus, we recommend a neutral rating on the issue. Investors having conviction in the long-term growth prospects of the company and wanting to tap this perceived opportunity could consider waiting for a possible correction in the stock price post IPO listing,” it said.
 
 
HEM Securities: Avoid
 
 The company is bringing in the issue at a price band of Rs 316-328 per share at a price-to-book value ratio of approx 3.92-4.07 and a post-issue book value of approximately Rs 80.53 per share. Though the company has strong promoter background, brand name and pan-India presence, but looking at the valuations, the issue looks steeply priced at present level.
 
 Also, the company has posted consecutive losses over the past few years, which doesn't give confidence for investment in the short term. However, in the long term one can invest when the company starts posting profits. Hence we recommend ‘avoid’ on issue.
 
 
Sharekhan: Only for long-term investors
 
 At the higher end of the issue price, adjusting for the valuation of the listed plays like MindTree, the coffee business is available at 25-26 times its FY2015 EV/Ebitda, which is in line with some of the listed comparable companies and thus is not cheap.
 
 However, given the strong brand image, extensive distribution reach and growing disposable income in India, the company is an attractive play on urban discretionary consumption and investors can look at it with a mid- to long-term investment horizon.
 
 
ICICI Securities: Subscribe
 
 “We believe CDEL, on the back of the Café Coffee Day business, would be a major beneficiary of the revival in urban discretionary consumption. At the price band of Rs 316-328, a target market cap and EV would be Rs 6,756 crore and Rs 10,510 crore, respectively, at the upper end of the price band,” the brokerage said.
 
 Given that the investment value of the IT, logistics, real estate and hospitality businesses is Rs 5,025 crore, the coffee business is available at 4.3 times EV/sales, which is at a 15 per cent discount to global coffee chain Starbucks. We recommend subscribe.

Ashwani Gujral: Today there is a bit of sector rotation, which means banks are kind of letting off a bit of steam and CNX IT is coming back to hold the market. One more important thing is that the action on Hindustan Unilever, a sort of bad news, just tells you about the strength of the stock and on this sort of news if the stock can move up, then the market is underestimating how high the stock could go.

	""We believe that the falling trend in GDP growth, investment growth and corporate earnings growth will reverse during 2014. The improvement will be likely visible in 2HCY14/FY15,"" said CLSA report titled 'Trend Reversal'.


	While the brokerage limits its Sensex target at 23,500 for December 2014, it believes that money will be made in cyclical sectors and in select stocks.


	""We highlight five investment themes for 2014 i) continuous improvement in policy environment ii) Greater investor patience for ‘Growth recovery’ plays iii) inflation & interest rates stabilising at higher level (after the expected dip in food inflation in Dec 13) driving gradual rupee depreciation iv) Rising asset/balance sheet utilization driving pricing power and v) deleveraging,"" the report said.


	CLSA is 'Overweight' on corporate lenders, consumer discretionary, utilities and mid-cap property to play the above themes.


	Its top stock ideas for 2014 are:


	Axis Bank


	We expect Axis’ earnings to surprise positively in FY14 and also report a healthy ~18-20 per cent CAGR over FY14-16. Earnings will be led by growth in retail segment. Its loan growth will be led by retail and SME segments as the bank focuses on improving its cross-sell ratios. We expect manageable pressure on the credit quality with gross NPL rising from 1.2 per cent of loans now to 3.4 per cent by Mar-16 and credit costs stabilising near 110bps of loans.


	However, the rise in credit costs will be offset by healthy topline growth and cost efficiencies. Axis is well placed to leverage recent capital raising and ROE should expand by 200-300bps to 18 per cent in FY16. We maintain Axis among our High-Conviction BUYs.


	Bharti Airtel


	Bharti Airtel’s valuations have caught up with multiple issues of slowing growth, high regulatory burden and a weak balance sheet, and we believe the risk-reward is now turning favourable. We believe the stock should outperform the market as mobile pricing pressure in India has abated, data ramp-up is at an inflection point, its Africa operations have stabilised and valuations appear to have factored in regulatory risks.


	HCL Tech


	In the past 24 months, HCL’s stock performance has been entirely earnings led with stock not seeing any re-rating despite the superior performance. HCL’s PE has been capped by fears around concentration of growth in infra services, doubts on sustainability of margins and potential business disruption post change in the CEO. This has thrown up a nice risk-reward for the stock as investors are giving a lower PE on suppressed earnings estimates.
	 

	 

	A section of the street has also been worried on quarterly disclosures being below industry standards. HCL has sought to correct some

	of this anxiety through improved financial disclosures starting 1QFY14. We see more legs to HCL’s consistent financial performance driving stock upsides hereon. We rate the stock Outperform.


	ICICI Bank


	Over FY14-16, we expect ICICI Bank to report slight uptick in earnings growth to 17 per cent CAGR compared to 16 per cent growth in FY14. The earnings growth will be led by topline growth and cost efficiencies that will compensate for rise in credit costs to 100bps of loans. While we expect rise in gross NPLs from 3 per cent now to +4 per cent in FY16, we don’t expect material deterioration to its large corporate portfolio because we foresee efforts to deleveraging of balance sheet to show results over next 12-18 months.


	Healthy earnings growth, manageable asset quality and improvement in ROE to 18 per cent (16-17 per cent now) will support re-rating of valuations. We maintain ICICI among our High- Conviction BUYs.


	ITC


	Strong positioning in cigarette provides high earnings visibility for ITC, which is the key in the current uncertain times and places ITC over peers.
	 

	Cigarette business continues to be the bedrock of ITC business model where the company enjoys strong pricing power in a stable industry structure.


	We believe that the worst is also behind for non-cigarette business (particularly hotels and paperboards) which have been reeling under pressure; new FMCG business is also set to turnaround in 2HFY14. The recent 15 per cent correction from peak provides an opportunity to BUY ITC which trades close at 25x FY15 earnings, which is at a discount to peers like HUL and justifiable given the stable and predictable earnings stream.


	Jaiprakash Power Ventures


	JPVL has one of the best project portfolios among Indian IPPs. Commissioning of Nigrie would be a key earnings driver for the company in near term. The company is also in talks to sell part of its hydro portfolio to bring down its debt. The transaction (if it happens) would remove a big overhang from the JPVL stock as the company would be able to reduce its gearing considerably and would be able to fund the balance requirements of Nigrie and Bara.


	Lupin


	An increasing number of niche product launches will result in strong growth in Lupin’s US generics business. This coupled with consistent above average growth in India will drive 21 per cent profit CAGR over FY13-16CL with potential upgrades from the US business. We believe valuations will sustain courtesy strong earnings growth and improving return ratios. We rate the stock BUY with Rs 1,075 target based on 21x one-year forward PE, a marginal premium to the sector average.


	Maruti Suzuki


	Maruti is our top pick in Indian autos led by strong company specific triggers over FY15-16 - 1) Rich line-up of new product launches, 2)

	Improvement in exports volumes, and 3) Margin expansion led by rising localization.
	 

	 

	We believe that the worst phase of competition is now behind and the company is well positioned to benefit from any demand recovery in the passenger vehicle industry. We see Maruti’s total volumes rising at a healthy 11 per cent CAGR over FY14-16 and expect the company to deliver a robust 28 per cent EPS CAGR over this period.


	Power Grid Corporation


	Power Grid Corporation, India's national transmission utility, is now trading close to its all-time low PE and PB multiples. The company earns a regulated return of 15.5 per cent on equity invested in transmission projects which is not affected by power demand-supply, coal shortages or delays in commissioning of generation projects.


	This has allowed the company to report steady earnings CAGR of over 20 per cent over last 3-5 years. Given its project pipeline we expect 14-16 per cent EPS CAGR over next 3-5 years. Attractive valuations, high earnings predictability and growth outlook are the key BUY arguments for Power Grid.


	Prestige Estates


	Amongst weakness in property markets across India, Bengaluru has stood out as the most resilient city as the city’s technology industry based economy continues to do well. Prestige Estates has the largest portfolio of Bengaluru offices amongst listed developers and with lease income matching interest outgo, capital structure is fairly de-risked.


	Its residential sales have shown strong growth over last three years and as the same get reflected in P&L during 2014, we will see Prestige’s earnings grow by 50 per cent YoY in FY15. Stock is attractive at 11x one year forward earnings.


	UltraTech Cement


	After a challenging FY14 characterized by muted demand growth along with pricing pressures, we believe that the profitability has bottomed out and there would be a gradual recovery over the next two years on the back of demand pick-up and moderate capacity expansions. The market leader, UltraTech should be an obvious beneficiary of this, which is also in the process of expanding its capacity (in phases) during FY14.


	This should drive a volume growth ahead of the largecaps peers in FY15-16. Following a 10 per cent Y-o-Y decline in earnings in FY14, we believe the base is also supportive. Over FY14-16, we expect a 25 per cent CAGR in earnings. Valuations at 16.5x FY15CL earnings are sustainable.


	Zee Entertainment


	Zee continues to benefit from a surge in domestic subscriptions driven by digitisation - which should continue in 2014 as deadline for Phase III of digitization roll out is set for Dec’14. While ad revenue macros are weak, Zee should outperform the industry as market shares of key channels is resilient and investment in content / new channels starts paying off.


	We expect an earnings CAGR of 22 per cent over FY14-16 with ad revenue growth built in at 13-14 per cent range – not assuming any substantial macro pick-up. Visibility on earnings growth staying high, cash generation remaining strong, balance sheet being net cash and management committed to increasing return of cash to shareholders, higher multiples are achievable."

Despite a discount, employees of state-run Coal India Ltd appear to be aloof to over six million shares set aside for them due to apprehensions that the “partial privatisation” - as they call the IPO - will lead to job losses.
  
  Company chairman Partho S Bhattacharya admitted on Tuesday the 6.31 million shares set aside for employees may not be fully subscribed and will be reallocated to investors. “We offered (employees) so many shares because we thought that if the company today is what it is, it is because of the employees .” He said qualified institutional buyers have already subscribed to their portion of the offer. Trading may start from November 4.
  
  Coal secretary C Balakrishnan too said there may be leftovers from the employee part since the trade unions were not supporting the IPO. Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a trade union with almost a million members according to its website, is discouraging employees from buying shares. The union held a nationwide strike on Monday to oppose the sale. According to union leaders, the IPO is the first step toward privatisation which they feel will also bring “job insecurity”.

 The move is in line with market regulator Sebi's decision in July to hike the minimum investment size for any equity derivative product to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2 lakh, to help safeguard small investors from high-risk products. 

 ""In pursuance of Sebi guidelines on review of minimum contract size in equity derivatives segment...the market lots of foreign index derivatives contracts shall be revised,"" BSE said in a circular. 

 The market lots, which refers to the number of contracts contained in one derivative security, has been changed for -- FTSE/JSE Top 40 Futures, Hang Seng Index Futures, Micex Index Futures and iBovespa Futures. 

 The stock exchange has increased the lot size of FTSE/ JSE Top 40 Futures to 15 from 10 and would be applicable for new generated and existing contracts, from September 18. FTSE/ JSE index tracks South Africa's 40 highest ranking companies. 

 Derivative contracts lots on MICEX Index Futures, which is related to 30 stocks of the major and rapidly developing Russian issuers, has been doubled to 300, with effect from September 16. The revised lot would apply for newly generated and existing contracts. 

 Further, BSE has revised upwards the lot size for Hang Seng Index Futures from 15 to 20. These new market lots for derivatives contracts based on the index measuring the largest and most liquid stocks in Hong Kong, would be applicable for November 2015 and subsequent expiries, from September 30. 

 For iBovespa Futures, based on index measuring the Brazilian stock market, lots has been increased two times to 10, from October 15. These lots would be for new generated and existing contracts, BSE said. 

 In 2011, Sebi had permitted stock exchanges to introduce futures and options contracts on foreign stock indices in the equity derivatives segment.

""The stock exchanges, including BSE, need to change their business model and promote investment-based trading and help in capital formation to generate funds for investments across various sectors,"" BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan said.  BSE, which is the world's largest exchange in terms of listed companies and figures among top-ten globally on various other parameters, is also planning to foray into commodity exchange segment, for which it has got Sebi's approval and further work is in progress.  ""We have got approval from the Sebi and from our board. The Sebi approval is to invest in a commodity exchange. However, we are yet to approach the commodity markets regulator FMC for their approval.  ""The application process takes a long time and once we submit the application to the FMC, it would go through it and then decide. Overall, it is a long process, but we have the right technology and capabilities and we are very positive about it,"" Chauhan told PTI in an interview.  When asked whether the BSE would set up an entirely new exchange or acquire an existing one, he said, ""Currently, we have not decided on our strategy. Now, since the approval from Sebi has come, we will discuss it internally and with our board. Accordingly, we will take a decision.""  With regard to the BSE's IPO, Chauhan said the exchange had applied to Sebi for its IPO in January 2013.  ""As and when the approval comes, BSE will go ahead with the process of filing the DRHP and other things. So, basically, we are awaiting the in-principle approval from Sebi,"" he said.  The BSE is also very bullish on its SME platform. ""As many as 83 companies are listed already on our SME platform and 20 more are in the pipeline,"" Chauhan said.  On plans to set up an international exchange in Gujarat, he said that ""basically, the concept is that there are several international finance centres (IFSCs) across the world, such as Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, London etc"".  ""Even Indian companies have to go and raise funds from those IFSCs. This concept has been deliberated several times in India as well, but could not fructify somehow.  	""So, when this Gujarat International Finance Tec-city (GIFT) concept came up and we held discussions with them, we were told that there would be some different kind of jurisdiction. The GIFT City basically will have two areas -- one is for the domestic where BSE Brokers Forum has also taken a big space and an international one.  	""Then there is an international area, where the taxation and other regulations could be entirely different. So, the idea is to set up an international exchange there that will cater to the companies and investors from across the world,"" Chauhan said.  	Giving examples, he said that an Indonesian company can come there to raise funds from European or American or even Indian investors, while an Indian company can also go to raise funds from the global investors.  	""The idea is to compete with IFSCs like Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong and other such places. If that happens, there would be a need for a separate international exchange.  	""It would be totally independent from the existing BSE... Once rules and regulations are finalised for this IFSC, at that time BSE would begin identifying partners and other details for this exchange. The exchange would just be a small portion of a large vision that GIFT City has,"" he added.  	When asked about BSE becoming a market leader across all segments, Chauhan said, ""For me, the exchange has to figure out where it wants to focus on.  	""Over the recent years, we focussed on technology, distribution. We were earlier slow, today we are the fastest exchange in India, by ten times or more than any other exchange in the country.  	""We were not having very good distribution network and were more of a Mumbai-centric exchange. Today that has changed and we have members distributed across India. We did not have enough products and were mostly doing equity trading.  	""Today, we have all kinds of products, ranging from equity to derivatives to mutual funds to almost everything. We are able to match other exchanges on many of our products now, including in some new areas like SMEs, currency derivatives and mutual funds.  	""New technology and lower costs have helped us a lot and this can make us much more successful in other areas as well. But, that does not mean that BSE will focus on trading, our focus area going forward will be capital formation,"" he added.  	Chauhan also pitched for the foreign exchanges being allowed to invest up to 15 per cent in the Indian exchanges, on lines of similar threshold limit for domestic investors.  	Currently, the rules do not allow a foreign entity to hold more than 5 per cent.  	""... Foreign institutions say that they should be allowed to hold up to 15 per cent for parity of treatment to financial institutions irrespective of they being Indian or foreign entities.  	""If that happens there would be some strategic investments by some foreign exchanges. Today, with 5 per cent cap they are essentially financial investors,"" Chauhan added."
BSE tweaks minimum base capital rules for brokers,"{""BSE"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bse-tweaks-minimum-base-capital-rules-for-brokers/articleshow/43808285.cms,m.economictimes.com,BSE tweaks minimum base capital rules for brokers,"NEW DELHI: The BSE has tweaked the Base Minimum Capital (BMC) norms for brokers, a move that will ensure that the deposits are maintained with the exchange and not with the clearing corporation. 

 The Base Minimum Capital (BMC) is the deposit maintained by the member of a stock exchange against which no exposure for trades is allowed. 

 It is meant for meeting contingencies in any segment of the exchange and commensurate with the risks that the broker may bring to the system. 

 ""...all deposits towards BMC will be required to be maintained with exchange,"" BSE said in a circular. 

 Currently, the BMC is blocked from the collaterals maintained with BSE's clearing corporation, ICCL, (Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL). 

 ""The Exchange (BSE), with ICCL, has initiated the process of segregating and taking over the collateral towards BMC from the collaterals maintained with ICCL,"" it added. 

 In the initial phase, the cash equivalent component of BMC collateral, to the extent possible, will be segregated from the collateral deposits maintained with ICCL and kept separately with the exchange. 

 Any shortfall in BMC collateral taken over by the exchange would be blocked from the collateral deposits of trading member maintained with ICCL. 

 The BSE said trading members would be intimated on the collaterals that have been taken over from ICCL towards BMC. 

 Brokers have been asked to ensure that at the time of renewals of fixed deposits (FDs) and bank guarantees (BGs) given as collateral to the clearing corporation, such amounts (to the extent of the shortfall) are deposited with the exchange. 

 ""Trading Members, whose shortfall in BMC is blocked from the collateral deposits maintained with ICCL, shall ensure at the time of renewing their bank guarantees, fixed deposits with BGs/ FDs with ICCL or depositing additional collaterals with ICCL, that FDs/ BGs to the extent of such shortfall is drawn in favour of the BSE and deposited with the exchange,"" the BSE said. 

 ""Such Trading Members can also voluntarily deposit FDs/ BGs with BSE towards BMC and to that extent the BMC will not be blocked at ICCL,"" it added. 

 According to norms, stock brokers or trading members should maintain a minimum capital of Rs 10 lakh in case of trading of securities are done through their own money rather than customer's without using Algo trade. 

 In 2013, capital market regulator Sebi has increased the base minimum capital (BMC) deposit for stock brokers to up to Rs 50 lakh, from a maximum of Rs 10 lakh earlier, especially the ones dealing with algorithmic trading (algo), in order to mitigate risks in the market."

Vinita Bali steps down as Britannia Managing Director,"{""Britannia"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/vinita-bali-steps-down-as-britannia-managing-director/articleshow/32676357.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Vinita Bali steps down as Britannia Managing Director,"MUMBAI: Vinita Bali has stepped down as the managing director of Britannia Industries after nine years at the helm. Varun Berry, current chief operating officer of the Nusli Wadiacontrolled biscuit company, will succeed her. 

 “I chose to retire because I was clear that I wanted to do something different for the next 20 years. I am moving from one full-time role to fulltime many roles,” said Bali who was the first woman to head a major consumer goods company in India, back in 2005. 

 A company statement said Bali, 58, will retire at the end of this fiscal year to pursue a variety of roles in the corporate and development sectors. She will continue to serve on the boards of the other Wadia Group firms such as Bombay Dyeing, Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation and Go Airlines. 

 The announcement was made after market hours. Earlier in the day, Britannia share price dropped 0.47 per cent to close at Rs841.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange while the benchmark Sensex index closed 0.27 per cent lower. ET was the first to report Bali’s plans to move on, in January. Britannia’s change at the helm comes at a time when the company prepares to chart a new growth strategy, with focus on high-margin products and innovations amid stiff competition from ITC, Parle and Danone. 

 The biscuit maker had kicked off the succession plan last year, when Berry was given the charge of domestic operations earlier headed by Bali. She was made the head of Britannia’s international operations, Britannia Nutrition Foundation and tasked with the responsibility of developing new business. But she retained the designation of managing director and was responsible for the company’s revenues and profit, while reporting to Wadia. During Bali's tenure, first as CEO and then as MD, the firm’s revenues have quadrupled from Rs1,510 crore in 2005 to Rs6,185 crore in 2013. 

 But net profit in these eight years has increased marginally from Rs149 crore to Rs259 crore, as the company has had to navigate high costs and ward off competition not just from established rivals such as Parle and ITC in its core biscuit business, but also from relatively new entrants like Cadbury Kraft’s Oreo and United Biscuits’ McVities. 

 While biscuits still contribute to over three-fourths of Britannia’s sales, the company has made an aggressive push in other categories such as milk, cheese, and ready-toeat food to grow its business and improve margins. In these segments, too, however, there is stiff competition from MTR, PepsiCo and Britannia’s erstwhile partner Danone, among others. Biscuit and dairy segment put together is the largest consumer segments in the country with a market size of of almost Rs9,500 crore."
Bonds now move in tandem with stocks,"{""Bonds"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/bonds-now-move-in-tandem-with-stocks/articleshow/47607951.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bonds now move in tandem with stocks,"Investors who’ve tried to balance their holdings between stocks and bonds may be less protected from asset-price swings than they think.
 
 Here’s why: bonds globally are becoming more volatile as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. And the debt, traditionally thought of as a haven investment, has been moving in tandem with stocks during recent periods of turmoil. Take, for example, the recent bout of bond turmoil, which started at the end of April. In the period, the correlation between global bond and stock returns surged to about 30%, the most since the May 2013 taper tantrum, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co ana lyst s led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.
 
 That means that both asset classes posted losses, even though government bonds are often thought of as a hedge to stocks. So it’s been painful for those who are looking for reliable returns by diversifying their investments.
 
 Indeed, higher bond yields may signal faster economic growth, better wages and a more stable global economy after years of uncertainty. But they also will translate into losses for investors who’ve grown more vulnerable than ever to rising borrowing costs. It’s going to be a rocky road ahead, even if central banks time any changes to their stimulus programmes perfectly."

  How do SKF and Bank of Baroda look on the charts? 
   
  It is too early to get into banks now. That decline of the last 2-3 days was rather intense for banks. Let's see them bottom out in a more definite manner. SKF India is a strong stock. It is pretty much at an all-time high now. It has had a good bull market. In fact, it started a month before the index, which indicates that even in bear market conditions, people were picking up the stock. So, this is an excellent recommendation. 
  
  I also like oil marketing companies. They have moved up to multi-month highs. Whether or not it is the crude oil situation but they always have been pretty good for portfolios. If you look at the kind of percentage falls they have had even in bad times, that's when crude is going up, they are not very large percentage declines. At the end of the day, you get very good returns on the oil companies, not dramatic movers but steady returns."

 Mitesh Thacker: It still remains a very-very stock specific market. The only thing which is positive is that the Bank Nifty has managed to close the day’s high. Typically last three or four times when the markets have been around 6350 it has been the Bank Nifty which kind of rally. So if Bank Nifty shows strength we might make a call beyond 6350 but again that is something which we will know in the next couple of days. 

 For the time being we are trading long on select banks not all of them. ICICI Bank, Bank of India and the Bank Nifty itself look pretty good to me but otherwise it is a market which is not showing signals of great trend. So even if we get a breakout it might be only for about 50 to 100 points and it might be just a shift of the range on the upside."

ET Now: Where you see markets in the coming days? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: We expect markets to remain stock-specific. This may be due to Bank Nifty. 

 In case, we see Bank Nifty falling below 18,700 levels, then we might have a breakdown. 

 The Bank Nifty right now is at quoting just around 18,700 levels. The structure is getting negative and that it could possibly weigh on the Nifty movement.
 
 We might see Bank Nifty triggering corrective declines in the NSE's benchmark. In case, Bank Nifty breaks below 8,740, then the index might slip towards 8,650 and we may see another 100-point decline in the Nifty. 
 
 The market may remain stock -specific. We may see choppiness within the said range. We might fall by about 100 points, or gain by about 100 points. It may not signal a big trend on the Nifty itself. Having said this, the Bank Nifty might get into a kind of movement. On the stock-specific side, I have a 'buy today sell tomorrow' call on ACC with a stop at Rs 1,624 for the targets of Rs 1,675 levels. We also have a 'buy' on Kolte Patil with a stop at Rs 208, for the targets of Rs 232."

Kanoria, who is also vice-chairman of SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd, says India has a lot to achieve before it becomes an easier destination for doing business. In an interview with ET, Kanoria talks about the challenges facing the economy and the reforms needed to address them. Edited excerpts:
 
 
Is the economy beginning to turn around?
 
 I would say that things have started to pick up, especially in the last two months. The mobilisation of equipment and workforce at the ground level has started, specifically driven by the road sector. At the same time, real estate is still lagging behind. Apart from tier-II and tier-III towns, it is still a challenging sector, primarily in the main cities and towns.
 
 
What more should the government do to boost the sentiment?
 
 There may be challenges and it may be taking time, but there is definitely a positive drive towards finding solutions. I think that the direction is right, but there’s a lot more to be done.
 
 We are creating all kinds of infrastructure, connecting India through the road network, rail network, air network and digital network. Although we say India is a united union and is one country, to do business within states is a nightmare. I have experienced this myself in our businesses. If we look at ease of doing business, the GST is a brahmastra (powerful weapon) to kick-start the GDP.
 
 GST and the dispute resolution mechanism through the Arbitration Act [need to be pushed]. We have to see how, in the next six months, we can release 25-40% of the claims that have been stuck in arbitration for years. This will release capital.
 
 
You’ve said earlier that you want a ‘pure’ GST. What is the most important feature that needs to be imbibed in the Bill to ensure its relevance and purity?
 
 It must ensure uniformity. There needs to be a reasonable tax.
 
 Broadly, I am happy with the structure of the Bill. Where we started to see concerns was when we saw in the media that some of the producing states were looking at an additional rate of tax. To my mind, that is not fair. When you are uniting India, don’t create a difference like that.
 
 Regardless of wherever the consumption happens, it will get ironed out. I may be wrong, but, to my mind, this GST will add 1.5-2% to the GDP when it comes.
 
 
Corporate results have been weak. Exports have done badly and credit offtake has been poor. In your view, what corrective measures are required?
 
 Today, the cash flow is stuck. Bankers will start to give in when they see that the projects are viable—when they see that there is a flow of cash.
 
 When the 2G scam happened, so many mines were shut. So many small entrepreneurs and contractors suffered. We need to correct that. Good governance and right policies will help resolve these problems.
 
 
Besides the GST, what other reforms should be on the government’s agenda during the ongoing winter session of parliament?
 
 Some of these bills are critical. People have learned from the past and have done whatever bit of political interference that was required. Maybe at this juncture, they will realise that the Arbitration Act and the bankruptcy law is important because they will help in resolving many of the country’s issues.
 
 
You’ve supported the idea of segregation between barren land and fertile land. How can this be implemented?
 
 My belief is that India has no dearth of land. The government can zone the entire country into three brackets (or more)—barren land, single crop and multi crop—and then create policies for each the way you create policies for various resources, specifying what activities can be carried out in these zones. I think this will unleash a huge amount of India’s resources. This is a detail we will be working on and sending recommendations to the government about.
 
 
What do you think of the ‘intolerance’ debate?
 
 I think the issue has been blown out of proportion. Some, who know India, know that it is a very tolerant country. Others who don’t, get a little scared, so we have to create positivity. The media has a strong responsibility not to create a huge issue out of it because this gives investors negative perceptions about India."

 Net sales during the quarter under review stood at Rs 3,412.61 crore, while it was Rs 3,033.86 crore in the same period previous fiscal. 

 The results include unaudited consolidated financials of Sleep International Pvt Ltd, in which the company acquired 51 per cent stake on August 8, 2013 and hence, are not comparable with the corresponding period, it said. 

 Commenting on the performance, Asian Paints Managing Director and CEO KBS Anand said: ""The decorative business in India did well considering the challenging and uncertain macro environment. Raw material prices were marginally higher in the third quarter."" 

 Cost of materials consumer stood at Rs 1,845.21 crore during the quarter as against Rs 1,572.30 crore in the year-ago period, the company said. 

 ""Industrial paints segment continued to be impacted by sluggish manufacturing environment in the economy, with no major capex activity. Automotive coatings growth was affected due to the subdued demand in automotive sector,"" he added 

 On the international business, Anand said Middle East and Asia have done well even though some countries continued to be affected by political events and macro economic uncertainty. 

 During the quarter, the company's wholly-owned arm Asian Paints Ltd, Mauritius (APIL) acquired an additional stake of 12.8 per cent in its subsidiary Berger International Ltd, Singapore (BIL) through a voluntary unconditional cash offer and open market purchases.

Sumantran's resignation as executive vice chairman and from his position in Ashok Leyland will be effective from 31 March 2014 .
 
 The announcement was made post the board meeting of Ashok Leyland on Thursday. Among many responsibilities, Sumantran had overseen the LCV business of Ashok Leyland with Nissan, setting up of construction equipment business with John Deere and expanding the Defence business for Ashok Leyland. He also helped Hinduja Group to diversify into various engineering business including products for the Defence sector.
 
 Ashok Leyland in a statement said Sumantran will continue to be an advisor to Hinduja Group and mentioned that Sumantran is pursuing interests in """"academia, research and consulting.""""
 
 Industry grapevine suggests that Sumantran's stepping down coincides with Tata Motors flagging off an hunt for a CEO, to replace the vacant position created by the sudden demise of Karl Slym, the Tata Motors CEO.
 
 Sumantran, an automobile industry veteran has vast experience of working in different auto majors like General Motors, SAAB Automotive and his term at Tata Motors in the past.
 
 Sumantran was in charge of Tata Motors passenger car business and was head of Engineering & Research Centre at Tata Motors from 2001 to 2005. Industry grapevine suggests that he is one of the key contenders to take over the reins at Tata Motors.
 
 In his mid-50s, Sumantran has vast experience of working in both passenger cars and commercial vehicles segment and the fact that he worked in Tata Motors in the past makes him an ideal candidate to lead the country's largest automobile company in terms of revenues.
 
 ET could not independently confirm this. And a message sent to Dr V Sumantran did not elicit any response.
 
 But people close to the company told ET, over the last few days the name of Dr V Sumantran has been doing the rounds.
 
 However, a section also believe that Mr Sumantran who's known as a strategist may not return to Tata Motors as a CEO, because the company needs a person capable for flawlessly executing the strategies that are already been put in place during Slym's time."

  Have you looked at the shipyard stocks, particularly ABG Shipyard, what is cooking here?
   
  You have twin drivers out there. One is that the order books are looking up and there is a certain amount of activity going on in that space. For instance ICICI Bank has just sold a sizable stake in Western India Shipyard to one of the shipyard majors and with the shipping companies expected to look up on the back of better freight rates and higher throughputs, it is only logical that some of the early triggers are coming into the shipyard business. 
  
  Normally they should have been in a lag but for the first time we are witnessing huge order book situations out there.

A2Z Engg plans Rs 350-cr public issue,"{""A2Z Engg"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/a2z-engg-plans-rs-350-cr-public-issue/articleshow/6020074.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,A2Z Engg plans Rs 350-cr public issue,"NEW DELHI: Engeenering and construction services firm A2Z Maintenance & Engineering Services plans to raise around Rs 350 crore through a public issue of shares to fund its expansion plans, a top company official said.
  
  The company will sell around 10% of the total equity through the public issue. A2Z Maintenance & Engineering Services managing director Amit Mittal said, “We expect to file draft red herring prospectus by month-end.”
  
  Companies issuing shares to the public are required to get their issue approved by the capital markets regulator and submit their prospectus giving details of the company besides the purpose of the fund-raising exercise.
  
  Started in 2002 as a facility management services company, A2Z has evolved into an engineering, procurement and construction services provider to the power transmission and distribution companies. For the year ended March 2010, the company had consolidated sales of Rs 1,200 crore and expects to grow 25% this year.
  
  The company has diversified into waste management, and plans to aggressively scale up this business after the public issue. The proceeds of the public issue will be used to fund the company’s several projects across renewable energy and waste management.
  
  At present, the founder Mr Mittal and his family, holds around 55% stake in the Gurgaon-based company, which will fall to around 50% post the issue. The remaining equity is held by three investors including Rakesh Jhunjhunwala who bought a 22% stake in 2006. Private equity funds Beacon India and India Equity Partners picked up minority stake in the company between 2007 and 2009.
  
  One of the private equity investors is expected to exit during the initial public offer, a person familiar with the matter said. Merrill Lynch, Enam Securities and IDFC are the merchant bankers for the issue, the same person said requesting anonymity."

 Markets started the week on a positive note with the Nifty making a fresh all-time high of 8180. But, from that point, the markets saw some profit-booking amid caution ahead of key economic data (foreign trade, IIP & CPI). 

 Also, the global markets turned shaky amid prospects of higher interest rates in the US and concerns over the Euro Zone and China. 

 The rupee weakened for two consecutive sessions (Tuesday and Wednesday) amid renewed strength in the US dollar. Derivatives data suggests long unwinding in the Nifty futures and the Bank Nifty futures, which is indicated 

 However, market breadth, as defined by advance-decline ratio, continues to be favourable, which implies that stockspecific activity remains strong. There is a lot of churning from large cap stocks to midcaps in the past week. 

 Options market indicates range-bound trend in the short term. The Nifty 8100 strike call and put hold equal OI concentration of around 45 lakh shares, which is a sign that trading will be range-bound in the near term. Range as defined by Nifty options chain is 8000-8200, with maximum put and call open interest at the two extremes, respectively. 

 
STOCK/OPTIONS STRATEGIES: 

 Covered Call in UPL: Buy UPL Sep futures at 384 and Sell 390 call at 11, with target of 400 and stop-loss at 375.

5150-5300 the big base for Nifty this year: IL&FS,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral"", ""IL&FS"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/5150-5300-the-big-base-for-nifty-this-year-ilfs/articleshow/8141467.cms,m.economictimes.com,5150-5300 the big base for Nifty this year: IL&FS,"Are you absolutely convinced that 5200-5300 is the big base for the Nifty for this year?
   
  
  Vibhav Kapoor: As things stand today, yes, I would think so, anywhere between 5150 to 5300 should be the big base because at that level, two things happen, one is valuation start to look pretty attractive even if you just factor in a 13-15% growth in profits for FY12. Secondly the market then is really underperforming the rest of the world in a very big way. If you look at the performance relative to the S&P as an example, we are ordinarily underperforming year to date by about 16-17% and let’s assume that the S&P stays at the same level and we go down by another 10%, you would be underperforming by about 25%, which is a huge underperformance. A similar situation is there with a lot of other emerging markets like Korea for example. 
  
  Below 5152, which has been a major support for the past year, year-and-a-half, if the market were to go below that, it would really signify that you are getting into a very long-term bear market, which can only happen if the economy goes into a recession and company’s profitability growth was down to below 7-8%. It does not seem to be the situation right now. Thirdly at some point of time once QE2 ends in the US, you would have a cooling down of commodity and oil prices to some extent and that would be helpful for inflation in India as well as for company’s margins and, therefore, going forward 5150-5300 at the moment is certainly a level, which one would buy aggressively and look to be a long-term one."

Ashwani Gujral:  The level on the Nifty is about say 7050 to 7080 and on the Bank Nifty it is about 14,050 to 14,100, these are both cash levels. Whenever the Nifty touches this level, it tends to have a bounce back so these are two levels people can keep in mind. Today in the morning Bank Nifty went below levels of 14,100 so that gave you a nice buying opportunity. This kind of surgical trading is now possible, blanket buying at any level and closing your eyes will not work."

Mr Das has been acting as chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of the country's largest state owned aluminium major since August 2012. He will be the company's first regular CMD in more than two years. 

 Earlier, ET had reported that the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Ansuman Das as its top choice for the job of chairman and managing director of Nalco, paving the way for the appointment of a regular chief in more than two years. 

 Mr Das who graduated in Mechanical Engineering from REC, Rourkela, (now a National Institute of Technology) in 1976, and did his MBA from University of Hull, UK. 

 He started his career with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and joined Nalco in 1982 in the company's formative years as senior engineer in project and technical services, subsequently rising to the post of general manager (marketing). He was instrumental in formation of various marketing policies and strategies both for domestic and overseas sales and launched almost all the value added products of Nalco. He took over as director (commercial) of Nalco in October 2009.
 
 Mr Das was also holding the additional charge of director (human resources) for a brief period in 2012, and now holds additional charge of director (finance). 

 Mr Das' appointment ends months of uncertainty about Nalco's top leadership. In the last few years, Nalco's top post has been riddled with controversies, with successive CMDs falling prey to corruption charges. In February 2011, A K Srivastava, then CMD, was charge-sheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and eventually removed form the top job. He was succeeded by B L Bagra, director (finance) as acting CMD. In August 2012, Bagra faced allegations of corruption and subsequently stepped down.
 
 However, he was later reinstated as director finance. Earlier, C Venkatramana erstwhile CMD, had to step aside and his position was taken by C R Pradhan who retired as acting CMD."
Arbitrageurs building positions in natural gas counter on MCX,"{""MCX"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/arbitrageurs-building-positions-in-natural-gas-counter-on-mcx/articleshow/30534285.cms,m.economictimes.com,Arbitrageurs building positions in natural gas counter on MCX,"MUMBAI: The natural gas counter on the MCX has been abuzz with activity of late because persons called arbitrageurs, who exploit price differences in a product that’s traded on different markets, are building positions in the counter, along with local speculators, claim brokers.
 
 While, in theory, an arbitrage trade is risk-free, in practice, factors like currency fluctuations could crimp profitability arising out of such trades.
 
 The MCX natural gas contract mimics the price movement of the US-based Nymex gas contract, but currency fluctuations and certain other factors have widened the disparity between the two contracts, which arbitrageurs are quick to exploit. This actually narrows the deviance in the two contracts.
 
 “Normally, there’s a spread of Rs 1 or so between MCX and Nymex contracts, but that’s increased of late,” said a broker on condition of anonymity as domestic commodity market participants cannot trade on foreign terminals. MCX cannot be blamed for such arb trades, added brokers, as they are beyond its jurisdiction. The volatility on MCX gas is reflecting that on Nymex.
 
 The price on MCX fell 14 per cent from a closing high of Rs 333.6 per mmBtu on February 4 to Rs 287.6 on February 10, before recovering to Rs 324.4 or 13 per cent on February 14. This is broadly in line with volatility on Nymex, but on all three days, the contracts on either bourse have traded at a premium or discount to each other.
 
 The rupee over the same period has fluctuated by 63 paise between high and low, which, among other factors, has resulted in intraday price skews between the two contracts. Arbitrageurs have exploited this skew, buying the contract which is cheaper and selling that which is costlier.
 
 For instance, on Feb 4, the MCX active natural gas contract closed at Rs 333.6, a discount of Rs 2.5 to the Nymex contract. While this may not be too big, it translates intoRs 25,000 at the contract level as the Nymex contract size is 10,000 mmBtu.
 
 
 To arbitrage, a person will have to but eight lots of MCX gas, which at 1250 mmBtu is a smaller contract. On February 10, MCX gas quoted at Rs 287.6, a premium ofRs 1.74 to Nymex and on Feb 14 at Rs 324.4, aRs 1.5 premium to the overseas contract. “These days sophisticated automated, or algo software on terminals spot price differences across markets in fractions of seconds and the gap is closed very soon,” said another broker.
 
 “Normally, there’s expected profit in such trades, but currency can play spoilsport, so there is risk to Indian players who enter such trades.” The Nymex contract has become very volatile because bitter cold in various parts of the US and has raised concerns that gas inventories could be depleted.
 
 Though commodity market regulator FMC disallows trading on foreign terminals, market sources claim that a few traders work around such restrictions. However, forecasts of milder weather, going forward, could dampen the volatility on the higher side.
 
 Also, the regulator could raise margins in light of heightened volatility, reducing gains from such trades."

Banking stocks to see lot of traction: Mitesh Thacker,"{""Banking stocks"": ""positive""}",https://m.economictimes.com/opinion/interviews/see-some-upside-in-market-on-monday-mitesh-thacker/articleshow/27025133.cms,m.economictimes.com,See some upside in market on Monday: Mitesh Thacker,"In an interview with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on the market and some stocks. Excerpts:


	ET Now: It has been an interesting week of trade. Sunday will probably have an impact on what the markets do on Monday morning, but what do the charts suggest, is there more upside in store?


	Mitesh Thacker: I would say the chances of some upside are definitely there. We have seen time and again the market rallies fail to get past the levels of 6300, 6335. This band of 35-40 points is an extremely important area wherein the market has historically registered multiple peaks. But this structure is quite positive also. What is encouraging is the fact that we saw rise as we got into the event in the last two days. So typically that suggests that directional trending move should begin, but I think once we start getting past 6340, 6350 levels, then we will see at least another 100-150-point upside happen on an immediate basis in the Nifty and that could be a good trading point if we get a gap up on Monday.


	ET Now: Besides Power Grid, the likes of Adani Power, GVK Power or for that matter Tata Power, where there is still opportunity to make money?


	Mitesh Thacker: See this entire space looks attractive to me even from the current levels. So Adani Power has met the first targets of 40, but I do not think there has been any kind of slowdown of the signal or momentum loss in the charts. So my belief is that maybe 43, 44 is what we are looking at. Tata Power can possibly go up to about the levels of 95. It has also given a breakout above its 200-day average today and 94, 95 is the first area and possibly even 100 can be tested over here. So there is still some more trading momentum left in these stocks. Both the flagship stocks can do well. The one which has not really participated is R-Power, but if it starts trading above 78, 78.5, then you might see a momentum breakout happening there as well.


	ET Now: Would you play any of them – Renuka, maybe a Bajaj Hindustan or Balrampur Chini?


	Mitesh Thacker: The chart was positive. I am just waiting for some kind of breakout to happen on the upside to confirm further movement or trended movement to take place. Renuka needs to get past 22.5 and then we can look for another 8-9% upside to 24.5, 25 in the next supply point. Bajaj Hindustan has declined a lot, extremely oversold on medium term charts, but needs to start getting past 15.75 to suggest that it is starting a short to medium term uptrend and then we look at targets of around 18.5 or so. So I am positive on the sector, but we will trade as the price gives confirmation of the trend on the upside.


	ET Now: Coming on these stocks – Strides and Jubilant Life – how much more downside do you see?


	Mitesh Thacker: Jubilant Life in fact has gone through a good uptrend from the levels of sub-100 to about 140 and it has corrected from those levels 140, 140 plus to about 120. My belief is that in case it continues to decline below 115, then we might look at 107, 105 being tested on the downside and I think that should be it. I do not have a view on Strides.
	 

	 

	ET Now: Is there is anything else that you saw because there was quite a bit of traction in Zee Entertainment in Friday’s session, Biocon is trading at new highs, do you like any of these two stocks?


	Mitesh Thacker: I like in fact both of them. Biocon clearly has been on the recommendation list for a number of weeks now. It comes as a buy call only, stays in the strong uptrend, 425 is the area where this stock can head. Zee is in fact just getting into newer swing highs in the sense that 280, 285 was the recent high which is the high in month of November and the long-term charts remain pretty strong over here. So again that is a stock which can do about the levels of 320. The other one which I can add over here is Divi's Lab. After the numbers it has kind of been sideways and it consolidates for about two-and-a-half, three weeks now so any time the stock starts getting past 1175, 1180, it might be a very interesting stock to look at.


	ET Now: Coming on some of these banking names, Bank Nifty showed a lot of open interest, like a couple of banking names particularly UCO or an OBC which had massive OI build up in Friday’s session too. Can the run-up that we saw continue well into the next week?


	Mitesh Thacker: I believe so. What happened on Thursday was that after the big gap up we saw Nifty kind of come down from the levels of 6300 and close about three quarters of a percent of the day’s high. While the Bank Nifty clearly closed very close to the day’s high, also is the fact that Bank Nifty closed higher on Friday, that is very, very higher compared to the Thursday high on Friday which the Nifty did not do so that is a very positive setup. Also, along with the kind of movement in the Bank Nifty, a lot of these banking stocks generated strong buy signals. So all of these PSU banks, particularly PNB, State Bank of India, Canara Bank and the smaller ones like UCO Bank and Allahabad Bank have given buy signals and I would be positive on them unless and until the Monday event turns out to be something drastically negative.


	ET Now: What is it that you are recommending for trade Monday morning?


	Mitesh Thacker: I have three buy calls again not from a very short-term point of view, but stocks which appear to have triggered a medium-term uptrend – Adani Ports can be bought with a stop below 157, for let us say about two-week targets of around 180 plus; IDFC is a buy with a stop at 107, for targets of 120-125 and being a low beta stock again it can take about 8-10 trading sessions to reach there. I have got a buy on ICICI Bank. This is slightly short-term in the sense that 1200 is an important area for the stock. So buy with that target and keep a stop below 1122."

 Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered will lead the offering, the proceeds from which will be used for capital expenditure needs. 

 The fundraising will be off the refiner's US$2bn MTN programme, which has scored a BBB- rating by Fitch. 

 BPCL plans to spend Rs150bn-200bn (US$2.4bn-3.2bn) on its Kochi refinery in the next two years, as reported earlier. 

 The company is increasing the capacity of the refinery to 15.5 million tonnes per annum from the current 9.5mtpa at a cost of around Rs165bn. 

 Meanwhile, the refiner has scrapped its US$500m loan refinancing for which it has received only one bid from a six bank group, according to sources aware of the situation. 

 Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, DBS Bank, HSBC, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Westpac Banking Corp are the banks forming the sole group that has bid for the BPCL deal. 

 BPCL scrapped the loan offering as the pricing offered by the bank group did not meet the company's expectations. 

 In mid-March, the borrower had sent a request for proposals for the loan, which would have an average life of around four years. Banks were asked to respond by April 1. 

 Sources said BPCL had initially eyed pricing of around 120bp all-in but received offers around 150bp from the bank group. 

 In January, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ won the mandate on BPCL's US$100m three-year refinancing at an all-in of 100bp and closed it as a bilateral later. 

 The Indian Government owns 54.9% of BPCL, the country's third largest refiner."

In a letter to National Stock Exchange, an apex body of trading members of all national exchanges in the country has contended that they are ""unable to comprehend high differential in transaction charges"" levied in the option segment for F&O (Futures and Options) and currency markets.  	While transaction charges vary from one exchange to the other, all of them have differential charges for different market segments.  	Besides, the charges are also typically linked to the trading volumes and the rates are lower for larger volume of trades.  	The letter, written by Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) earlier this month, follows a representation made by an ANMI delegation before the NSE.  	ANMI is a pan-India body comprising trading members across the country of NSE, BSE and other exchanges having national presence. NSE is the largest exchange in the country in terms of trade volumes.  	The industry body further said that a reduction in transaction charges ""will only encourage members to increase the volume of business that is being placed through NSE.""  	""Amongst several points made in the representation we have highlighted that the transaction charges levied by NSE on Options segment (F&O and Currency) is exorbitant.  	""You are aware that transaction charges on purchase and sell of Options is 0.05 per cent of the premium, while the transaction charges in the equity delivery segment and in the equity intraday is only 0.0031 per cent,"" ANMI wrote.  	Pointing out that the market regulator Sebi's turnover charges were same across segments, ANMI further said that stamp duty charges on equity intraday segment and stamp duty levied on options is also uniform.  	""Members are therefore unable to comprehend high differential in transaction charges levied by you in option segment (F&O and Currency).  	""We would like to further draw your attention that apart from statutory dues mentioned above there is incidence of STT (Securities Transaction Tax) and service taxes, which increases the cost of transactions.  	""You are aware that the volumes in options segment (F&O and Currency) have grown considerably whereas the high cost of transaction has only translated in reduced brokerage levels for the industry.

BSE to foray into commodities trading with new platform,"{""BSE"": ""neutral"", ""commodities"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bse-to-foray-into-commodities-trading-with-new-platform/articleshow/44959454.cms,m.economictimes.com,BSE to foray into commodities trading with new platform,"NEW DELHI: Leading bourse BSE is planning to launch a separate platform for trading of various commodities to foray into commodity exchange business -- currently dominated by two major players, MCX and NCDEX. 

 A proposal in this regard has been approved by the board of BSE, which is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of number of listed companies and holds top positions on various other counts. 

 Sources said the BSE board has cleared the proposal and further modalities would be put in place soon. 

 Incidentally, BSE had also put in an initial bid, estimated at about Rs 500 crore, recently for purchase of 15 per cent stake in the country's largest commodity exchange Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). 

 Kotak Group finally acquired the MCX stake for Rs 459 crore, while BSE and another bidder Reliance Capital did not participate in final bidding due to adverse comments made by the exchange's auditors in the wake of NSEL scam. 

 The commodity trading business in India records total turnover of over Rs 100 lakh crore annually, although only two players dominate the market. 

 There used to over 20 commodity exchanges in India, including six of national-level, but the total number has now come down to ten. This includes four national-level bourses. Volumes have also come down in recent quarters, due to imposition of commodities transaction tax, among others. 

 BSE, which was set up in 1875 and is the oldest exchange in Asia, is currently one of the two major bourses in India. There are more than 5,500 companies listed on BSE, which is highest for any exchange in the world, with a total market capitalisation of over Rs 93 lakh crore. 

 After beginning with a humble background of functioning under banyan trees over 125 years ago, BSE has now emerged as one of the world's most technologically advanced exchanges and is targeting ten-times faster trades on its platform within three years. 

 Already, the exchange has made significant changes in its technology and has attained a response time of 200 micro- seconds for trades executed on its platform, BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan recently told PTI in an interview. 

 The aim is to bring the response time further down to 20 micro-seconds within the next three years, he had said. 

 Presently, BSE handles 500,000 orders in a second at the response time of 200 micro seconds. There are more than 2.6 crore investors registered on BSE. 

 BSE's 30-share index Sensex is known as the benchmark index of the Indian stock market. 

 During the financial year 2013-14, the exchange recorded a total income of Rs 529.71 crore, while profits rose by 25 per cent to Rs Rs 135.19 crore."

Nitin Raheja: What you are seeing in Ceat is actually what you have seen in a lot of stocks across the sector where you had huge under valuation which was on the extreme. When you saw the large base of the turnover and when you start seeing margin starting to play an upside, even a 1% change in margin on the increment makes a big impact. So, in our view it is fairly priced at this moment at least in the shorter term. Now people will look at actual incremental volume numbers or volume driven growth to drive the stock further."

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: The track for banks clearly is bad but along with PSU banks this week NBFC and quality private banks also have got whacked, is it a good time not to buy into quality NBFC stocks and revisit private banks?
 
 
Prateek Agarwal: I will want to segment a bit, we would want to look at pricing power. Pricing power in certain NBFCs which may be let say focused on sectors like CV financing may be low at this point in time because the space itself is very damaged. There is hardly any growth that we are looking at in the CV space. So if a NBFC is present in a space where the consumer demand is strong I guess they would have better pricing power and it may make sense to back those kind of models rather than single product models where the product itself is going through a lean patch.
 
 Yes, NBFCs some of them have really done well in terms of scaling up, tighter liquidity makes the NBFC model a bit more susceptible versus banks but I guess if you have pricing power increase in cost may be passed on so we do have some exposure to NBFCs and we believe we will keep looking in that space. Also, some of the NBFCs offer a good way of playing the insurance theme, if you look at the valuations of best of NBFCs with insurance as the core value that they offer the valuations are actually cheaper than some of the best run banks. While if you look at the business per se it would stand to reason if I say insurance is a superior business versus banking. So there is some correction in valuations which need to take place.

Across the world, securities markets are vulnerable as adoption of technology has not only been fast, but dependence on technology is also 100%.The worry is that such attacks are getting sophisticated,” the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman UK Sinha said at an event here. He was addressing the Cyber Security Resilience Conference, organised by Sebi and the BSE.  	Sinha said as these cyber attackers use the latest technology they could be state-sponsored. “These are done by people who have the best of technology and resources, and some of them are state-sponsored. It has a huge impact on larger systems, society and nations,” he said. These cyber attacks are not just restricted to the financial services sector but are happening across all sectors of the econom, he added “The risk is the effect it has on business and, therefore, one can only guess in terms of protecting the network. Globally, the challenge for all the markets and regulators is to assess the gap and prepare to maintain the sanctity of the markets. Openness and co-operation will help in a big way,” Sinha said.  	The Sebi chief also added that although adoption of the latest technologies is advantageous, it also has its own challenges and hence there is a need to create more awareness, conduct frequent audits of the system and mock-drills.  	The global forum for securities market regulators, International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), has also been working on it. “IOSCO has been working on it for the last two years, on how countries and regulators across the world should coordinate and prepare for it,” Sinha said.  	Maharashtra Governor Vidyasagar Rao, who was also present at the event, said: “I am told manipulation of stock exchanges is the new modus operandi used by terrorist groups to raise funds for their operations. We need ecosystems to protect the economic sovereignty of the nation. We also need to evolve a foolproof cyber-security mechanism to protect the economic integrity of corporates, multinational corporations, and business organisations.”  	He added that the number of cyber crimes in the country could touch three lakhs this year."
Dalit Entrepreneurs celebrate the launch of Dicci's Mumbai chapter,"{""Dicci"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/dalit-entrepreneurs-celebrate-the-launch-of-diccis-mumbai-chapter/articleshow/8643132.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Dalit Entrepreneurs celebrate the launch of Dicci's Mumbai chapter,"MUMBAI: Dalit capitalism, on the fringes of socioeconomic debate for a while, finally ordained its high priests, bared the material possessions and aplomb of new Dalit wealth, and basked in a serenade by officials of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at a ‘coming out’ party of sorts in Mumbai on Saturday. 
  
  Some of the 1,000-odd signatories to this new take on capitalism — members of the fledgling Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (Dicci) — met at The Rooftop Rendezvous of Hotel Taj Mahal in south Mumbai, the evening hiring charges of which exceed Rs 5 lakh. 
  
  The launch of Dicci’s Mumbai chapter, in a way, heralds the willingness of this small set to stand up and be counted among wealth creators of a new and reforming India. The deliberate choice of venue, the BMWs and limousines in the parking lot, and display of the usual trappings of wealth was to signal their ‘arrival’, as it were, in India’s financial capital, the city of opportunities, and home to some of the most distinguished industrial groups of the country. 
  
  “We are now in the league of jobgivers,” says Milind Kamble, chairman, Dicci. The congregation even found a poster boy in Rajesh Saraiya, CEO of the UK-based SteelMont, which has a turnover of about $400 million. Saraiya, a penurious youth from rural Uttar Pradesh, began his career in Ukraine as a Russian language interpreter to billionaire steel tycoon Laxmi Niwas Mittal. He eventually got into steel trading and is now one of the biggest buyers of steel from SAIL, the Indian public sector giant. Would he get into steel manufacturing, emulating his first employer? 
  
  “I have just started my India operations,” he says. “It’s early days; but nothing can be ruled out.” CAPITAL, NOT CASTE The confidence and resolve of the bunch of Dalit entrepreneurs at the meet was infectious as they, dressed in dapper business suits and with glasses of single malt whisky, recalled their early days. The caste prejudices they confronted as struggling Dalits were, however, cast aside and not broached. “Look ahead, the future belongs to us,” says Ashok Khade, managing director of the Rs 550-crore DAS Offshore Engineering. Khade employs 4,500 people, of which 152 are BTech engineers.
  
  However, Khade’s business card still bears the wounds of prejudices, past and, perhaps, the present. It simply says ‘K Ashok’, concealing his surname, a caste giveaway. Also present was Kalpana Saroj, chairperson of Kamani Tubes, who Chandra Bhan Prasad, Dalit activist and a mentor of Dicci, on the occasion, dubbed as the ‘Oprah Winfrey of Dalits’. Saroj recently took over Kamani and is nursing the sick company back to health.
  
   “We will turn the corner soon to healthy profits,” she says. While the Dalit entrepreneurs bonded and celebrated the creation of a collective of their own, they agreed on the fact that their journey had been a long struggle and that one of the most serious impediments had been access to capital, which many face even today. Arun Khobragade, former senior vice-president of ABN Amro Bank and now promoter of a successful frozen foods company, is toying with the idea of raising a venture capital fund. Raising capital is indeed a challenge for all entrepreneurs, Dalits included. 
  
  Therefore, Dicci members were all ears when Lakshman Gugulothu, MD and CEO of BSE’s new SME Exchange, slated to launch operations soon, dwelt on the intricacies of public offerings and market making. Small and medium enterprises with a post-issue paid-up capital of up to Rs 25 crore are eligible to list on the new exchange. Issues around access to capital and the need to grow throw up numerous questions in the Dalit context. 
  
  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
  
  Can this new lot, especially the newer, younger lot, progress and also foster a new generation of Dalit entrepreneurs without proactive support from the government and the rest of Indian industry? They drew comfort in the presence of Jamshed Irani, director of Tata Sons and a keen proponent of affirmative action in the private sector. 
  
  However, another Tata luminary, B Muthuraman, was absent. Muthuraman, the vice-chairman of Tata Steel and the newly-elected president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, had promised to launch the Mumbai chapter. Muthuraman has been voicing his support for affirmative action and a key initiative: supplier diversity. Supplier diversity is a concept with roots in the American affirmative action framework, where large companies seek out, support — in terms of management and technology inputs — and buy goods and services from underprivileged and minority suppliers. In the US, supplier diversity has helped scores of black and minority suppliers enter critical supply chains of large multinationals. 
  
  The Billion Dollar Roundtable — a club of over 15 companies, including Ford, Honda, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Proctor & Gamble and Walmart — spend at least $1 billion annually with minority and women-owned suppliers. Member companies of another platform, the National Minority Suppliers Development Council, sourced supplies worth $101 billion from minority businesses in 2009. Will Indian industrialists and industry promote a similar support structure for Dalit and other minority entrepreneurs? 
  
  There are no positive signs whatsoever, though the Tatas, especially Tata Motors, has made some small beginnings towards this. The Indian government is beginning to get into the act by tweaking a quota for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe (SC/ST) suppliers in governmental tender purchases. Over a decade ago, the Digvijay Singh government in Madhya Pradesh had launched a SC supplier support initiative. 
  
  The Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh made noises on this issue by mandating preferential purchases to publicprivate partnerships, but nothing really materialised. EXCLUSIVE OR INCLUSIVE? Although we have a handful of Dalit entrepreneurs, who are celebrating the discovery of their own, Dalit entrepreneurship will need society’s support to gain critical mass. Will it be forthcoming? No, says Anand Teltumbde, civil rights activist, who quit as CEO of Petronet India recently. Teltumbde, grandson of Babasaheb Ambedkar, is aghast at the manner in which a small band of Dalit capitalists are being cited and portrayed as a marker of progress for the entire Dalit community.
  
  “It’s nothing short of a cruel joke,” he says, coming as it is in the face of continued atrocities on Dalits across the country and the precarious state of much of the Dalit rural populace. He even questions the strategy of Dalit entrepreneurs to assemble as Dicci. “They would have progressed better if they joined a mainstream chambers of commerce instead of appending a caste idiom to the outfit. It will raise the antennas of people against them and restrict business opportunities; it defies business logic,” he explains. “It’s ghettoising entrepreneurship.” Teltumbde doesn’t expect the new Dalit elite to do much for the community, as has always been with Dalit elite over the past decades. However, the new bunch of entrepreneurs refute this contention. 
  
  Malkiat Chand of the Rs 70-crore Janagal Exports of Ludhiana recalls how he had, time and again, attempted to create new Dalit vendors for his company, with varying degrees of success. The Makwanas of a Rs 300-crore industrial group in Gujarat claim that Dalits make up over half their labour force. “We don’t believe in the existing political and social structures to emancipate Dalits. 
  
  What we, as entrepreneurs, can do is to create and foster an ecosystem of Dalit vendors, as a road to progress,” says Arun Khobragade of RAS Frozen Foods. While Teltumbde dubs the newfound profile being given to Dalit enterprise as the handiwork of neo-liberal forces to co-opt the new breed of Dalits, even at the launch ceremony there were subtle rumblings on the very form of capitalism that Dalits ought to pursue. 
  
  Would their brand of capitalism be based on the neo-liberal variety of greed and profit-maximisation, or would it veer towards something with an ethical and moral underpinning? Asmall section of the attendees, especially Kuldeep Ramteke, an IIT alumnus, talked about the ‘Buddhist economy’ and the concept of ‘gross national happiness’, against the fascination for GDP growth. A sizeable section of Dalits in Maharashtra, the Mahars, to which Babasaheb Ambedkar once belonged, are Buddhists. The new Dalit elite do have a lot to chew upon."

Did Federal Reserve's Janet Yellen just enter currency wars?,"{""Federal Reserve"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/did-federal-reserves-janet-yellen-just-enter-currency-wars/articleshow/46305983.cms,m.economictimes.com,Did Federal Reserve's Janet Yellen just enter currency wars?,"NEW YORK: The minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting last month have foreign-exchange traders wondering whether Janet Yellen has joined the currency wars. Policy makers pointed to the dollar's rising value as ""a persistent source of restraint"" on exports in a surprisingly dovish set of minutes published Wednesday. The greenback fell against a broad group of its peers.
 
 Central bankers from Europe to Australia have engaged this year in bouts of rate-cutting one-upmanship, leaving the US, and possibly Britain, as the only developed nations seen as likely to raise borrowing costs in 2015. The dollar climbed to its strongest in more than a decade as a result, prompting billionaire Warren Buffett and Goldman Sachs Group Inc president Gary Cohn to question whether the Fed can now increase rates without damaging the US economy. ""The Fed is finding a very subtle way to temper the enthusiasm around the risks of a sustained dollar bull market that gets out of control,"" said Alessio de Longis, a macro strategist in New York at OppenheimerFunds, whose division oversees $11.6 billion. ""What the Fed is trying to decelerate a bit is this dollar appreciation in order to make sure that the transition to a Fed hiking policy is more gradual.""
 
 The greenback's gains this year added to a 13 per cent jump in the second half of 2014 that was its strongest advance since 2008, even as the US economic recovery started to disappoint. The Citi Economic Surprise Index shows US economic data are falling short of expectations by the most in more than two years.
 
 Officials are inclined to keep rates near zero for longer, with many participants saying a premature rate increase might damp the economic recovery, the minutes show. Participants flagged the ascendant dollar's negative effect on net exports, with a few pointing to the risk the currency could appreciate further. Mitigating those dangers are low energy prices, which may have a greater-than-forecast positive impact on growth, and accommodative policy overseas that supports the international outlook, the Fed said.
 
 Central bankers from Australia to Canada to Sweden are among those implementing monetary policies to boost growth. That stimulus has weakened their exchange rates, which helps make their economies more competitive, a knock-on effect that analysts have called a currency war. US companies are already feeling the pinch. They're having to learn to live with a dollar rally that doesn't necessarily reflect a stronger economy, Goldman Sachs's Cohn said. Retail sales and durable goods orders have weakened in recent months and multinationals, including Procter & Gamble Co and DuPont Co, are already seeing the strong currency weigh on earnings. The currency's strength makes it ""very tough"" for the Fed to lift interest rates this year, Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said this month.
 
 That said, consumer spending accounts for almost 70 per cent of gross domestic product, while exports comprise about 13 per cent."

Other than that, as far as the domestic situation is concerned, results will pave the way for giving direction to the market. As long as the results are not surprisingly negative, the markets should find itself in the 8000-8500 range."

 The stock closed the day at Rs 193.70, down 8.10 points, or 4.01%.
 
 On the bad side, the apex court has imposed an interim restriction on the maximum annual excavation from the mining leases to 20 million tonne.
 
 According to analysts, with the lifting of ban, the production would begin in second half of 2014. Earnings from iron ore unit would add 5 per cent more to EBITDA.
 
 “The ruling comes across as a huge relief to iron ore producers in Goa, especially for Sesa Sterlite – the largest miner in the state. While actual resumption of mining will take 2-3 quarters as several regulatory approvals still need to be in place, the ruling clears the roadmap for restart of iron ore mining,” said IDFC report.
 
 According to the brokerage, the ruling is positive for the company and the financial benefits of the same will accrue in 2HFY15 as mining will commence with a lag of 2-3 quarters from the ruling. It factors in production of 5.2/12.6m tonnes in FY15/16.
 
 It has maintained ‘Outperformer’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 227 per share.
 
 According CLSA analysts, the Supreme Court’s decision is positive for the company. They expect operating performance to improve over the next two years. The mining capacity could get capped at 8-9 million tonnes but the lifting of ban will boost the company’s FY15 EPS.
 
 It has maintained a ‘buy’ on the stock with target of Rs 225.
 
 The company remains our top pick of Maybank Kim Eng in the materials sector.
 
 “The stock rallied 5 per cent following news of lifting of the mining ban. A favourable election outcome next month could spark a sharp rally in the stock price,” the report said."

ET Now: How are you reading into this tempted pullback from the market in the last hour for three successive sessions now, does it seem like this pullback can sustain itself? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: I have been slightly biased towards the positive side for last one or two sessions and I have said that the pullbacks in declining market are typically choppy. So, we have seen the choppiness. The pullback is far from over the intraday indicators the trend falling ones are still in a rising mode. Until, we start getting below 5150 I would maintain a slightly positive bias if I am trading with extreme short term horizon and look at pullback to about levels of 6100-6120 which is what I have been maintaining for last few days. In fact, given the way the short term charts are kind of diverging from the medium terms charts there could be possibility of a range bound consolidation happening in the markets for the next few days. So, 6100 to about 5950 could be a range which the market might remain in for the next five to six sessions."

Normally, that is good oversold level from where the markets bounce back and that is exactly what is happening. On the upside, we may not break 6060-6100 on the Spot Nifty, may act as a resistance. The longer term trend, the weekly charts are still bearish. So I would say as far as the Nifty is concerned at higher levels nearer 6100, I would still be a seller. Now whether we break 5950-5900, that remains to be seen but broadly, 5950 to 6100, this 100-150-170-point range is where I see the Nifty moving in. There are two long shadows for the past two days that indicates buying at lower levels but that also talks of a lot of choppiness and I expect that to continue. So I cannot say that we have made a bottom and we will go up one way. Lot of choppy moves expected in the next few trading sessions with the Nifty moving between 5950 and 6100."

Whatever be the reasons, now we are in for a move from 8,400. Nifty is in a range of 8,450 to 8,650 and I believe that the bottom has been reached.
 
 The bearish view that we had is over. The bulls are not willing to let go and we will certainly test 8,650 or probably even one shade higher than that, may around 8,700-8,750levels. On a correction of 30-50 points, I would be a buyer on Nifty as well. All this while, it was more of a stock-specific day. Now, the Nifty is ready to move towards 8,650-8,700 and, on the downside, 8450 may not be broken on the index.

How wary would you be of further incremental investments in large cap IT? 

 
Deven Choksey: It is a good point and I certainly believe that given the valuation at which these companies are trading, if they continue to command the premium valuations, then probably the question would be whether they could sustain the growth and they could produce higher amount of growth. At this point of time, I do believe that the things are not completely out of control. Maybe in this quarter, it was expected that they may probably miss out some part of the targets. I would think that we will wait for the commentaries to come from the management of some of these companies at the end of the quarter results and probably see where exactly they would like to take up the businesses going forward. My reading says that some of the newer areas of the business would probably drive the growth in these companies and that is where we would probably keep an eye on and see how exactly they keep winning some of the inorganic growth strategies which certainly in some of the companies cases may sound little bit more promising at this point of time. So we will wait for the commentary of the management to come. At this point of time, we are not taking any view on buying side of the large IT companies. We are basically more focussed and stay invested with some of the midsize IT companies where the growth is relatively more promising and we see the valuations also remaining in favour of investors to add them into the portfolios.

Has RIL turned the corner? Some analysts think so,"{""RIL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/has-ril-turned-the-corner-some-analysts-think-so/articleshow/45568256.cms,m.economictimes.com,Has RIL turned the corner? Some analysts think so,"MUMBAI: Will Reliance Industries be able to snap its 7-year disappointing run on Dalal Street in 2015? After underperforming the Sensex since 2008, foreign brokerages believe that Reliance is poised to perform better on the bourses next year as the stock is cheap after the recent correction.
 
 Reliance shares have risen about 3% so far in 2014 against the Sensex’s advance of 32% in the period. From their 52-week high in May, the stock is down almost 23% and is trading near the 2012 share buyback price of Rs 870. The stock closed at Rs 880 on Thursday.
 
 

 
 Analysts at brokerages such as UBS, Citi, and Nomura see this underperformance as an opportunity to buy as they believe all negative news and investor concerns are priced into the stock. “RIL’s strong positioning, relatively attractive valuations against regional refining and petchem peers, and stock hovering around its 2012 buyback price of Rs 870 give attractive upside potential.
 
 Hence, we have put a price target of Rs 1,400 on the stock,” said Ashish Jagnani, analyst at UBS. Before 2008, Reliance Industries was the most influential stock on the domestic bourses and was a must-have in every investor portfolio.
 
 After that, the stock lost its popularity among investors.
 
 More recently, investors have been worried about the volatility in its refining margins, telecom launch, lowerthan-expected gas prices and uncertainty over shale gas production in the wake of the drop in crude prices. Analysts are, however, optimistic about the company’s prospects.
 
 “RIL is likely to turn around in 2015 as the focus will be on the much-anticipated telecom launch. However, the spotlight is also likely to be on the fast-completing petchem and refining expansion plans, which will be a key driver of 70% earnings growth in the next 4 years,” said Anil Sharma, analyst at Nomura.
 
 Analysts expect investors to become favourable towards RIL stock, going forward, as the company's $8.5 billion petchem investment will become operational in phases by 2016.
 
 “We have a price target of Rs 1,120 on RIL stock, and even under bearish assumptions, we have a stress-case valuation of .`950, which is about 10% above the current price levels implying favourable risk-reward ratio. The rupee depreciation is expected to provide further cushion for the stock price,” said Saurabh Handa, analyst at Citi."

Hemindra Hazari: Yes I do believe so. But, if you see the index of industrial production (IIP) readings for the consumer durables sector, you will find them unimpressive. The numbers may suggest that there are only a handful of companies in the white goods space that are apparently doing well. White goods space looks in doldrums, if you consider tepid IIP numbers for the sector. Hence, one has to be very stock-specific rather than having a sectorial view in the present economic environment.

HCL Q3 Results: Five things to watch out for,"{""HCL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/hcl-q3-results-five-things-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/46995913.cms,m.economictimes.com,HCL Q3 Results: Five things to watch out for,"NEW DELHI: HCL Technologies, the fourth-largest largest Indian information technology player, which reports its third quarter results in Tuesday, is expected to lead growth among the Indian IT companies in the March quarter, even as it deals with cross-currency headwinds. 

 Last week, bigger rival TCS posted its worst quarter in nearly five years, because of cross currency movements impacting its topline. 

 Here are five things to watch out for in HCL Technologies’ results: 

 1. Growth: HCL Technologies’ growth in constant currency is expected to be around 3.9%, according to analyst estimates, while in reported currency, it is likely to be under 1%. HCL said in March it expects adverse cross-currency impact of about 280 basis points impact on revenue growth in US dollars for the quarter ending March 31. 

 However, HCL is the top pick for analysts who expect it to lead growth in constant currency among Indian IT companies for the March quarter. 

 2. Margins: Currency fluctuations are also likely to hit the company’s margins, which are expected to decline by nearly 80 basis points, dues to high exposure to infrastructure management contracts which were signed in a weak rupee environment, according to Kotak Institutional Equities analysts. 

 3. Deal wins and Pricing: A number of large deals are up for renewal this year and analysts will be watching for commentary on pricing. IT companies have said that basic services are being increasingly commoditized and clients are focusing on productivity improvements through the use of robotics and automation. 

 4. Client Budgets: Earlier this month, analyst firm Gartner said worldwide IT spending would decrease 1.3% to $3.66 trillion in 2015 due to a stronger dollar. This latest estimate was a cut from its previous expectation of growth of 2.4%. 

 The investor community is likely to look out for commentary on demand from clients in 2015 and the number of large deals signed. 

 5. Growth in IMS and Software services: Analysts and investors will also keenly watch the company’s performance in its software services business, led by engineering services, hence the volume growth in engineering services, where it has a large play, will be a key metric to watch out for. Growth in HCL’s fastest growing business IMS has been cause for some concern in the past and investors will watch out for growth prospects in this business."

The issue came after a 2-month lull as firms were seeking exemption on certain redemption reserve requirements under the amended Companies Act. On the first day, the company raised about Rs850 crore, according to merchant bankers familiar with the development. 

 The issue generated considerable interest among institutional investors, including foreign institutional investors, mutual funds, insurers and corporate houses. A foreign institutional investment arm of a large European bank may have bought more than Rs 500 crore of this AAA-rated debt instrument, two domestic institutional investors told ET on condition of anonymity. 

 However, an email sent to HDFC remained unanswered at the time of going to press. ""After a long time, a toprated issuer brought out an issue following exemption from the government. Issues are likely to rise in June,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, adding that yield is attractive as the 1-year bank certificate of deposit is quoting about 9%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. 

 The yield spread or a gauge for pricing, which is currently 13 basis points, was about 20-25 bps last time when the housing finance company had raised funds prior to April. This suggests a better pricing for the company this time. In the secondary market, HDFC bonds maturing in 2016 are currently quoting yields in the range of around 9.25-9.35%, 20-30 bps lower than one-month earlier levels. 

 ICICI Securities Primary Dealership and Deutsche Bank are the two investment bankers for the issue. Last week, EThad reported that the ministry of corporate affairs had issued a notice granting exemption to all non-banking finance companies from maintaining 50% debenture redemption ratio (DRR), which was mandated for public issuers earlier, but at 25%."

Excerpts: 
 
 
ET Now: The Modi government has completed a full year. What is your own assessment of how the government has faired out in term of reforms as well as policy measures, which have been undertaken to aid economic growth?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: The whole context of reform has to be seen in a larger picture. Do not forget that Mr Modi inherited an economy which had a fair number of problems that had to be fixed and all these cannot be fixed overnight, which is where we had been warning that expectations -- both in terms of scope and speed with which things are going to be done -- seem to be unrealistically high.
 
 So it has been a productive year. There is still a certain sense of disappointment of under-delivery, but that is despite some meaningful hits that the government has recorded. Do bear in mind this certain sense of disappointment has to be seen in the context of unrealistically high investor expectations. So a very healthy reset of expectations is taking place.
 
 There are clearly areas -- for example, the MAT tax issue which was almost like a self-inflicted injury – which could have been totally avoided. But all in all, the healing process from a macro perspective continues. This government has more time. I mean the initial sense of disappointment is understandable, but the correction is much more relative to where expectations were in the stratosphere. I still believe Mr Modi remains the person most capable of bringing about a transformational change in India. I would only reiterate what I have been mentioning for quite some time that investors will just have to be patient.
 
 
ET Now: You also believe that lower-than-expected IIP and easing CPI have only strengthened the case for another rate cut. Do you think there is a case for it to be out of policy?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: Has it strengthened the case for another rate cut? Absolutely. Can it be out of policy? That possibility is always there. Do not forget the two rate cuts this year were out of policy and also consecutive. So, in a way the central bank itself has shown a poor discipline of sticking to scheduled policy meetings, which is what it should be doing.
 
 Out-of-policy moves are made under really extreme distressing circumstance and it is difficult to make the case for any of those as far as India is concerned. So, what additional information is going to get waiting until early June beats me. I cannot totally rule out any intermeeting move, but if not even in early June, the case for a rate cut remains because the actual picture on the monsoon will not come about until the month of July passes.
 
 
ET Now: Some of the economists also see Reserve Bank of India cutting rates followed by a prolonged pause. Would you agree that there is an upside risk to inflation and what is the cumulative rate cut expectations in 2015?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: Do not forget that our case had always been that market expectations since the beginning of the year of an aggressive easing by RBI were unfounded and certainly unrealistic. One, purely in terms of how much oil prices had dropped, it was debatable whether that would be sustainable and we have seen roughly $20 increase since the bottom already come through.
 
 I do not think it is as much a risk of inflation picking up in any meaningful manner as much as people missing the broader picture that RBI’s game plan, unlike ever in the past, is also to facilitate a downshift as far as trend inflation is concerned. This has to play out even as the economic growth picks up over the next two to three years. So, my sense remains we have at least one more rate cut and if the monsoon is not as disappointing as is feared, there could possibly be one more rate cut, but that is about it.
 
ET Now: One of the other points that you make is IIP where the growth has slowed. However, what are the key trends that you are watching on the lead economic indicators? Is the economic recovery showing any kind of pickup at all?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: One of the more challenging aspects, which are unique to India, is that the revision on the GDP methodology creates a big gap between the synchronisation of what the bottom up high frequency indicators are suggesting versus what the revised GDP methodology has suggested. What I mean by that is, while the GDP numbers or the revision or the new methodology show a much perky momentum, as far as growth is concerned, at 7.4% for last year advanced estimates, that is slightly better this year. The ground evidence does not really necessarily support that.
 
 The economy is growing at 7-7.5%, carry a certain spring in their step which is pretty much conspicuous by its absence as far as India is concerned. So, in that way it will very much continue and create a certain element of uncertainty whether India is really recovering, stabilising or it is actually slowing down further. So those questions will continue and we really cannot do much about that.
 
 The corporate sectors results do not seem to suggest any meaningful improvement coming through and all of this has to be seen in the context that recovery in India was very much meant to be uneven and gradual in the initial phases. You are dealing with a $2-trillion economy where the investment cycle, given some of the supply-side issues it is dealing with, and policy-related issues will take time to heal and begin to show itself. So even for FY16, we expect a very marginal improvement, 7.6 at best.
 
 
ET Now: Let us talk about the rupee and the 10-year paper. What is your sense there? What could be the range for the rupee in the medium term and where do you think that 10-year paper will finally settle?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: Our rupee view really has not changed. It is rather boring, I understand. Markets have flip-flopped. I still think the rupee will move lower to 67 in a year’s time. What continues to be overlooked for example is while everyone celebrates the big decline in India’s inflation, what is ignored is that India still has the second highest inflation in Asia and that is simply because the broader global disinflationary impact of, for example, commodity price correction was favourable to inflation in other countries as well.
 
 So India’s inflation differential continues to argue why the rupee should actually depreciate. It is just that the magnitude of portfolio flows has pushed the currency away from where perhaps it should be given the state of the real economy and the RBI itself given the fact that it has been mopping up reserves by intervention shows that it has not been comfortable with letting it to appreciate. So a gradual depreciation is still very much going to be the order of the day. India is much more resilient today, but that does not mean that it is completely immune to any adverse global event as such."

 Dabba trading is an illegal activity as trading takes place outside recognised stock exchanges, mainly to save on tax and trading fees. The practice has made a comeback in the run-up to the elections.
 
 The regulator has asked stock exchanges to keep a tab on the closed premises of stock brokers as there is a possibility that these offices will be used for illegal trading.
 
 Sebi, apart from seeking specific information from market participants about such illegal activities, has also written to the state governments seeking information in this regard, sources said.

There can always be a view point that this particular development will be triggering the stock although at 160 levels, but the whole activity of this banking licence is a matter of 18 months. It will take time.
 
 Investors should be carefully watching all developments of IDFC. It may not be as easy as one would like to believe because the competition levels are much higher in comparison to the times of Kotak or Yes Bank when they started 10 years back.
 
 One has to see the whole IDFC banking licence in that context. Eventually, it may cross 160-200 levels in two-year kind of perspective, but it should be in the 120-140 kind of range in the short term."

Anish Damania: One needs to look at in contrast with the other market. So typically, we need to also look at the multiples in relation to the interest rates.
 
 So we have a 10-year government yield at about 9% and if we really take it that equities is a function of one by the bond market, then you have 11 to 12 PE in a slow growth environment.
 
 In a higher growth environment, you can give a better multiple but having said that, we are yet to see the higher growth environment come through. One is not very certain about it, it is still sometime away. So in relation to where the interest rates are, it is not a cheap market."
Infosys' March guidance for next fiscal is very crucial,"{""Infosys"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/infosys-march-guidance-for-next-fiscal-is-very-crucial/articleshow/5438781.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys' March guidance for next fiscal is very crucial,"For long, the Infosys management has managed the art of pegging expectations lower and then surprising the Street. During the pervious earnings call, the company had guided for a dismal performance in the December ‘09 quarter. But on Tuesday, when the country’s second-largest IT exporter unveiled its quarterly numbers, investors were more than amused. A stronger sequential growth in business volumes at lower operating and administrative costs resulted in better-than-expected sales and profit growth. Infosys shares rallied by 4% on Tuesday, as investors caught by surprise bought into the shares of the Bangalore-based company.Dollar-denominated revenues shot up by close to 7% sequentially to touch the highest-ever quarterly level of $1,232 million. The sharp rise that followed the sluggishness seen in the previous few quarters, underlines the demand recovery. This is also evident from the 12.5% growth in the revenue contribution of the top 10 clients. Here again, the double-digit growth was visible after a long time. It largely reflects recovery in US banking and finance segments.Two other strong indicators of improving demand are the upward revision in the FY10 guidance and higher intake of new employees. In stark contrast with its earlier guidance of over 4.8% drop in earning per share (EPS), Infosys now expects FY10 EPS to grow by 2.4% to around Rs 107. Also, it plans to add 4,000 more employees by the end of the fiscal than what it had indicated earlier. What is also interesting to note is that Infy’s growth mirrors higher earnings quality in terms of margins and receivables days. Despite salary hikes during the December quarter that reduced operating margin by 200 basis points (bps), the company actually improved its margin by 90 basis points. Higher employee utilisation and lower expenses were the key drivers.Infy has also improved its efficiency in collecting outstanding sales. It now takes 57 days to collect receivables, five less than in FY09. At the Monday’s close of Rs 2,587, the Infy scrip is available at 24 times its FY10 estimated earnings. According to Dipen Shah, VP-research at Kotak Securities, Infy is likely to report an EPS of Rs 124 in FY11, thus signalling a forward P/E of 21. He has assumed a lower profit growth of 15% since Infy has indicated that its tax outgo relative to before tax profit would rise to 25% from 21% now. This is because the proportion of its tax exempt revenue has reduced from as much as 93% in FY08 to current 70%. ‘This may reduce EPS by Rs 4-5 for FY11,’ Mr Shah reckons.Analysts such as Mr Shah have upgraded Infy’s scrip to the ‘buy’ category, after its December quarter performance. Infy’s numbers reveal that the worst is behind us. Going ahead, demand is likely to be buoyant as discretionary spends are gradually back on track. With recruitment in full swing, Infosys appears to be well prepared to take advantage of the recovery. The March quarter would be crucial since the company would provide its next year guidance and its commentary on the IT budget scene in the US."

 ""Promotional roadshows were last week held in US and London. They will now be held in Singapore and Hong Kong beginning tomorrow,"" an official said. 

 Officials from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Department of Disinvestment will hardsell the IOC stake sale, which is crucial for meeting government's investment target of Rs 40,000 crore. 

 The proposed issue of 19.16 crore IOC shares is likely to fetch as much as Rs 3,900 crore at current prices. 

 At the roadshows last week, IOC was sold to investors as ""The Future of India Energy."" 

 In the presentation to investors, it was highlighted that IOC is the largest refiner in the country which has ""Strong support from the Government of India"" and is ""Driven by a Management Team that has Delivered Results."" 

 IOC has 10 refineries with 65.7 million tonnes of crude oil processing capacity, which constitutes 31 per cent of the domestic refining capacity. It has 11,000-plus km of crude oil, product and natural gas pipelines and a 44 per cent fuel market share. Also, it is the second largest petrochemical firm in the country behind Reliance Industries. 

 It is expanding its footprint in oil and gas exploration, LNG, wind and solar power besides venturing into nuclear energy to become an integrated energy company, the presentation said. 

 IOC, it said, is investing USD 2.077 billion in core business of oil refining and marketing and petrochemicals and has plans to invest USD 2.448 billion in the next. It has an capital outlay of USD 2.09 billion for 2015-16 and USD 2.009 billion for 2016-17. 

 IOC Chairman R S Butola had just before the US and UK roadshows stated that the department of disinvestment (DoD) may be wanting to assess the market conditions at the roadshows and will take a view on the stake sale based on the response. 

 The company was of the opinion that the government should not lauch the stake sale now as the company share price is ""unduly depressed"". 

 The IOC scrip today closed at Rs 203.15 on the BSE, 46 per cent below the 52-week peak of Rs 375 reached on January 18. 

 Government holds 78.92 per cent stake in the country's largest oil refiner as on June 30. 

 Citibank, HSBC and UBS Securities are among the five merchant bankers selected to manage the IOC share sale."

Let us talk about the market texture right now, the fact that FMCG is making a comeback, the fact that some of these textile retail plays are all sitting at all-time highs irrespective of the rich valuation that these stocks are quoting at clearly gives you a sense that the upcoming festival season is going to be a bumper one for the consumption space.We are gearing up for a very good earning season and the last two-three earnings season were impacted by higher commodity prices but a lot of commodity consumers have passed on those price increases. We should have the two major variables being positive for most Indian corporates. That being higher, top line growth and improvement in operating profit margins as price increases are being passed on.
 
We are seeing a decent amount of interest coming through in almost every sector with the exception of perhaps commodities and software companies where the earnings may be slightly on the softer side. But by and large, we should see a very good earning season. That is driving a lot of interest into stocks. We have the issues of Ukraine and higher interest rates, but the underlying fundamentals of the Indian economy are sound and improving by the day. 
 

We all know how Britannia, Unilever, ITC stocks have done but the interesting thing is happening within the textile/retail space. From bigger ones like Trent, Aditya Birla Fashions to Go Fashion to Arvind Limited, all are excited. Would you still recommend buying into it?We are very positive on the retail space and after a torrid time during the Covid restrictions, we are seeing retail coming back very strongly, especially offline retail. A lot of clothes are coming into stores and that certainly is very good for the retail players. Top pick with usual disclosure that we and our clients are invested, would be something like Vedant Fashions. 
 
I know it is expensive but it faces the least amount of threat from online players because when you go for an occasion like marriage, you need to try on those clothes and you cannot really buy them online. Second, a newly listed company is Go Fashions. Theri quarterly numbers have been quite impressive and there has been a very decent runway for growth as well.
 
Valuations are reasonable if you compare some of the other retail companies. These are the two top picks. Both are new listings but one of the dark horses could be V-Mart, only thing that last quarter numbers were a bit disappointing and it has a lot of exposure to rural markets which are a bit soft at this point of time but the underlying business model is excellent so I would say that go for the midcap stocks within the retail space and they should do pretty well. Other stocks also look interesting and if you are holding the likes of Aditya Birla Fashion, Trent, Avenue Supermart, all of them should do pretty well going forward.


How are you looking at the diagnostics and hospitals space and what would your top bets be?Healthcare should do very well going forward but one needs to be a bit selective over there. I would avoid pharmaceutical companies. They had a great time during Covid and a lot of opportunities worked out very well for them.
 
But I think the time is not right for the sector as a whole because of what is happening in the US generics market and increased competitive intensity in the domestic market. We are seeing challenges in the laboratory space, the path lab segment, with new entrants and increased competition. 
 
In my opinion, the best way to play healthcare would be through hospital companies like Apollo, Max Healthcare and Narayana Hrudayalaya.They all have come with a very decent set of numbers and valuations are reasonable. A lot of these companies are going in for expansion of existing capacities which they have set up and are now seeing very good utilisation levels as well. So it is very positive over there. 
 
A company to watch could be even Krishna Medical which is quite an efficient, regional player. I think it is trading at a slight discount to its peer groups. So there is a lot of opportunities within the healthcare space but let us focus mainly on the hospitals I think they should do very well going forward.
 

What is the outlook on the defence space? In the last one to two years, nearly 200 items have been added to the defence import embargo list. The Russia-Ukraine war has aso put a lot of emphasis on indigenisation and a number of these stocks have been active of late. Is there merit in betting on the defence theme?I think defence has hit a purple patch, especially PSU defence companies and they are sitting on very decent order book position; margins are stable and investors have a lot of confidence in these companies because of the earnings visibility on account of multi-year order book position.
 
Gradually valuations have also moved up but by and large, it is a well discovered, well researched sector and stock prices have moved up. Our view would be slightly neutral on it. May be if there is a market correction or sector specific correction, then these stocks could be interesting and provide a higher return then buying them at these levels but existing investors should remain completely invested. From an investment perspective, I would like to buy it at a decline rather than these levels.
 

What is your take on IT? The rupee has been weakening and is at a record low against the dollar. Today Accenture will come out with its earnings and that will be important because that will tell you how the FY23 outlook is with respect to their client budget etc. How should one be positioned in the IT sector?Wait and watch. Let us see what these IT companies have to report, how the new order positions are shaping up and let us see what the management has to say in terms of the demand scenario. In the past whenever there has been a recession in US and Europe, IT companies have seen declining to stagnating revenues and a steep decline in their valuations as well. 
 
As we speak, the time to sell IT has gone. They corrected by 20% to 40% or so. If you are invested in IT stocks, all you have to do is just wait out the stressful times for the global economy and hope that in six to 12 months, demand will start reviving. Now the entire industry has been telling us that IT spending is no longer as discretionary as before and maybe that will get tested in this quarter and the next. It is interesting time for the sector but I would not like to add any further investment into IT. Just remain invested and wait and watch how this sector shapes up."

 After nod to the composite scheme of arrangement amongst Jindal Stainless and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries, the meeting is being convened following directions from the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. 

 The Court has asked the stainless steel maker to convene ""meetings of equity shareholders, secured creditors and unsecured creditors"" for considering the composite scheme of arrangement among the four companies, according to a filing to the BSE. 

 On April 13, the company, through postal ballot, had sought the approval of public shareholders on the composite scheme of arrangement between Jindal Stainless, Jindal Stainless (Hisar), Jindal United Steel and Jindal Coke and their respective shareholders and creditors. 

 The domestic stainless steelmaker had last month received stock exchanges' nod for the proposed demerger, a move aimed at boosting profitability and paring debt. 

 At present, the steel maker's debt stands at about Rs 8,500 crore, as per a company source, who said that this will come down by Rs 5,000 crore post-restructuring. 

 According to the sources, this Rs 5,000 crore debt will be borne by the three companies which will help Jindal Stainless to complete the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) programme, which has been underway since 2012. 

 In December, the company's board had approved the plan. Under the scheme, Jindal Stainless proposes to demerge its ferro alloys and mining divisions and vest them with Jindal Stainless (Hisar). 

 It will also transfer stainless steel making facilities in Hisar to Jindal Stainless (Hisar) for a lump sum consideration of over Rs 2,809 crore. 

 Jindal Stainless will transfer the hot strip plant located in Odisha to Jindal United Steel by way of slump sale for Rs 2,412.67 crore, the company had earlier said. 

 The company also had proposed to transfer its coke oven plant in Odisha to Jindal Coke by way of a slump sale for Rs 492.64 crore. 

 Once the rejig scheme becomes effective, Jindal Stainless (Hisar) would seek listing of its equity shares on both the exchanges and its global depository receipts (GDR) at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. 

 As part of the scheme, the shareholders of the company would be issued shares by Jindal Stainless (Hisar) as per the share entitlement ratio of 1:1. 

 Apart from aiming at unlocking value for shareholders, increasing profitability, reduction of the debt and improvement of the serviceability of the debt, the rejig plan also aims to increase capacity utilisation, enable the backward integration, ensure long-term stability and focused management of different business verticals."

 In an interim order passed late last night, Sebi barred Factorial from the Indian securities market after finding its Cayman Islands-based fund - Factorial Master Fund - to have allegedly profited through 'short-selling' in shares of L&T Finance Holdings on the basis of unlawful access to insider information about the company. 

 A Factorial spokesperson in Hong Kong told PTI, ""Factorial believes that the allegations outlined in an interim order from the Indian regulator (SEBI) are without merit. 

 ""The regulator has given 21 days to Factorial to respond. Factorial will continue to fully co-operate, and is confident that a complete investigation will fully absolve it."" 

 Factorial Capital Management Ltd is an alternatives asset manager and Factorial Master Fund is its flagship fund. 

 This fund focuses on pan-Asian bottom-up investing across equities, fixed income and volatility products, while hedging out macro risks (to be broadly market-neutral). 

 Factorial and its funds are Cayman domiciled, while the Advisor (Factorial Management Ltd) is based out of Hong Kong, and is regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.

Legal tussle forces Sebi to re-think decision on self-regulation,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/legal-tussle-forces-sebi-to-re-think-decision-on-self-regulation/articleshow/32810301.cms,m.economictimes.com,Legal tussle forces Sebi to re-think decision on self-regulation,"MUMBAI: For Sebi chief UK Sinha and his team, an unexpected legal tussle is lurking around the corner. It pertains to self-regulation in India’s Rs9-lakh crore mutual fund (MF) industry.

An entity led by Justice BN Srikrishna, who headed the panel that recommended sweeping changes in the financial sector laws, besides having chaired several other committees, has taken the regulator to court. Financial Planning Supervisory Foundation (FPSF), a charitable organisation where Justice Srikrishna is a director, has challenged Sebi’s decision to grant preliminary permission to an arm of the nodal body of fund houses to act as a self-regulatory organisation (SRO).

Srikrishna will be the chairman of FPSF from April 1. The decision to move SAT was taken at a meeting chaired by him. However, it’s unclear whether FPSF will pursue the case if Sebi reviews its decision. Responding to ET’s email query, a Sebi spokesman said, “Sebi has received a representation from FPSF in the matter of granting in-principle approval in respect of application of Institution of Mutual Fund Intermediaries (IMFI) (set up by AMFI) for recognition as an SRO for mutual fund distributors. In light of the representation, Sebi is verifying facts. After following due process, the whole matter may be revisited, if so required.”

On February 6, Sebi gave in-principle approval to IMFI, promoted by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), to act as an SRO for distributors of mutual fund products. In its appeal filed on Thursday before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (or SAT) — a quasi-judicial authority — FPSF has observed that since the proposed SRO is for the ‘distributors’ of mutual funds, there would be conflict of interest if a company established by an industry group that has been protecting the interests of the manufacturers (or MF houses) is appointed as an SRO, and which would now be in charge of regulating the same distributors and agents of the same manufacturers’ financial products.


	 


As against this, FPSF, promoted by FPSB India, another charitable organisation comprising various differing interests, was set up with the objective to serve as an SRO “dedicated to the public interest while promoting objectives of enhancing market integrity, investors protection and market efficiency” among other things.

However, the hard legal argument made in the appeal puts a question mark on IMFI’s application to Sebi for becoming an SRO. Referring to records available with the ministry of corporate affairs, FPSF has pointed out that IMFI was incorporated on August 2, 2013, which was well after the deadline set by Sebi for receiving applications. By way of a public notice dated June 27, 2013, Sebi had declared July 31, 2013, as the last date for receiving applications from eligible applicants desirous of being recognised as an SRO. Therefore, Sebi, according to the appeal, had granted in-principle approval for acting as an SRO to a “phantom applicant which was not a legal person at the time of application”.

According to FPSB — which is keen to act as an SRO and had filed its application to Sebi on July 29 — this was in “direct and clear violation of Sebi’s SRO regulations and of common law principles and jurisprudence relating to incorporation creating a legal person”. The appellant has prayed the tribunal should set aside Sebi’s decision to grant an in-principle approval to IMFI for setting up an SRO for distributors, grant stay on all proceedings in relation to the selection and grant of final approval to IMFI, and direct Sebi to share with FPSF the grounds on which it was not granted an in-principle approval for recognition as an SRO. Sebi, according to the petition, acted in an “arbitrary and non-transparent manner by not disclosing the criteria for the selection process.”"

Harendra Kumar: Obviously this is a washout year for at least for the next two quarters for the banking space and the PSU clearly has in terms of what they have to do because of the action and squeeze in margins what they are seeing. So the private banks is a space where people are herded towards but clearly the choices are getting limited out there.
 
 If you ask us where the opportunities lie, they lie in some of the regional banks such as Jammu & Kashmir Bank, maybe Karur Vysya Bank and new private sectors like Yes Bank of an IndusInd Bank where the growth is relatively robust but overall as a space, clearly it is very difficult option to pick at this point of time.

Ashwani Gujral: The market was expected to be flat whether or not there was a policy. So it is just the technical position of the market where you have had strong rallies and now it is a period of sideways move for both Nifty as well as the Bank Nifty.
 
 What has gotten crunched down is the export space and probably that can perk the Nifty up for the next three to five sessions while the rest of the market consolidates/corrects.
 
 Nifty chances are around 6,630-6,640 and is likely to find support. Bank Nifty may have a little deeper correction, that too in a worst case scenario, 12,400 to 12,600; in that zone it should consolidate and then once this rest period is over - probably which will continue for the entire week - we could start moving up again.
 
 So this is a period where you keep your trading generally restricted in the domestic cyclicals and try to play the bounces on the export groups."
Maharashtra say no to Bt cotton seed price hike,"{""Bt cotton seed"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/maharashtra-say-no-to-bt-cotton-seed-price-hike/articleshow/8236063.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maharashtra say no to Bt cotton seed price hike,"PUNE: The Bt cotton seed companies have got a major blow as Maharashtra, the largest cotton growing state, refused to increase the price of Bt cotton seeds. This is likely to create a severe shortage of seeds in north Maharashtra’s irrigated cotton cultivation belt where sowing begins from Akshay Tritiya as the companies want to wait till they are able to convince the government on the price hike. 
  
  “We will again plead with the government to take cognizance of the increases in costs. Gujarat, the top seed producing state, has asked the seed companies to pay higher price to the farmers for seeds produced last year from this year’s sales. We are still hopeful that we will get the government to review their decision in next few days,” said Paresh Verma, chairman of National Seed Association of India. 
  
  Though the cotton prices have more than doubled in the last three years, state governments had kept Bt cotton seed prices fixed during the same period. The Maharashtra agriculture minister had recently announced that his government would increase Bt cotton seed prices if Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, the two major cotton growing states, do so. 
  
  Gujarat government had announced that it would increase Bt cotton seed prices by Rs 180 per bag for both Bollgard (I) and Bollgard (II). But the cotton farmers are unhappy with the hike in seed prices. The Gujarat government suffered another blow when the Gujarat High Court struck down the Gujarat Cotton Seed Act, which controls the cotton seed prices. 
  
  The government had to announce a rebate of Rs 100 per packet of Bt cotton seeds sold at the Kirshi Melas for maximum two packets per farmer. The Maharashtra government has kept its decision in abeyance, keeping a watch on the developments in Gujarat. This had led to a restlessness among seed companies and cotton farmers in Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar. The seed companies have not made the seeds available in the market as they are waiting for the new prices to be print on the seed packets."

 Vishal Kshtriya, Edelweiss
 

 After witnessing a breakout, the Nifty index continued its uptrend and made a new life-time high. Importantly, the rally was driven by good volumes and positive market breadth, which shows that the ascent is more broad-based. The rally was further accompanied by a spurt in open interest in the F&O market, indicating long build-up. 

 On the F&O rollover front, we have seen ~55 per cent marketwide positions getting rolled over to the next F&O series. On the Nifty front, we have seen relatively lower rolls on the back of higher roll costs. Cost to rolls (for long) has been rising, which indicates long side roll aggression. Based on Nifty open interest options structure, we expect the March series to expire between 6600 and 6650. 

 Put-call ratio based on OI is trading at 1.14, which indicates that bias in the market is positive. The India Volatility Index (VIX) is trading in a narrow range of 16-18. Eventually, we expect a breakout in VIX in the coming days/weeks. Important level to watch out on the upside is 20. 

 In our last article, we had mentioned about the seasonality analysis of Nifty from which we concluded that we may see big moves in March. We have already seen MTD change in the Nifty of 5.5per cent. 

 Banking stocks followed by capital goods and auto have been the leaders in the current rally. We have seen huge long build-ups in stocks from these sectors. We have seen long build-up in ICICI Bank and we expect this stock to trade with a positive bias in coming months."

Pankaj Pandey: Yes, again a good set of numbers from them. In fact on the margin side we were expecting slightly muted margin but the margins come out to be good. The stock is trading at about 18 times FY16 basis so it is quite richly valued but given the consistency there will be marginal revision in the target prices from current levels of 1020. The concern for the stock would be that the domestic business last grew by 5% and probably at the sustainability of the margins or EBITDA margins of about 28%. So, these are the two concerns but there will be slightly marginal revision in the target prices but we will continue to maintain the positive bias in the stock."

 Traditionally, the October-December quarter is a weak quarter for IT companies as the number of working days is lesser compared to other quarters due to the holiday season at the client locations. 

 ""We expect tier-1 IT aggregate growth to moderate to 3.2 per cent q-o-q, given seasonal impacts of lesser working days and year-end shutdowns/furloughs,"" Nomura Equity Research said in a report. 

 It added that while TCS and Wipro are expected to lead the tally in terms of USD revenue growth, Infosys is likely to lag. The quarter is expected to be decent for Cognizant, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra. 

 The earnings season will be kicked off by Infosys announcing its numbers for October-December quarter on January 10, followed by HCL Technologies on January 16 and Wipro on January 17. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is yet to announce the date. 

 According to Angel Broking, volume growth in the quarter will be impacted by lesser working days, furloughs across industries and lower spending in verticals like retail, manufacturing and in services like consulting and enterprise solutions. 

 With the rupee appreciating marginally (on average basis), the revenue growth in rupee terms could get negatively impacted and trim down the operating margins of IT players by 0-10 basis points q-o-q. 

 For Q3 FY2014, in rupee terms, revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 1-3 per cent q-o-q for tier-I IT firms and 0.5-2.7 per cent q-o-q for tier-II companies. 

 IT analysts remain confident of the sector doing well in the following quarters. 

 ""We believe IT services demand is likely to continue to improve in FY2015 led by a better macroeconomic growth outlook. Preliminary discussions with IT companies and clients indicate that IT budgeting cycle for CY2014 is expected to begin on a positive note with signs of improvement in economic activities,"" Angel Broking said in its report. 

 Increasing offshore penetration in Europe and pick-up in discretionary spend in the US geography as well as demand for new technologies ie Social, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud is also likely to drive demand, it added. 

 Healthy pick-up in spending in key markets of North America and scope for accelerated market share gains in Europe can support about 15 per cent growth for the industry, which in turn can satiate the growth appetite of all players and reduce pricing pressure, Kotak Institutional Equities said. 

 ""We will watch for commentary on the outcome of clients' budgeting cycles to assess the strength of the demand environment and its sustainability,"" it added."

The company’s total income in the same period rose 23.7% to Rs 9,388 crore, from Rs 7,586 crore last year. “The third quarter last year was the worst for oil refineries. The inventory loss was at $14.37 per barrel,” MRPL chairman RS Sharma said in a statement.Public sector oil marketing companies depend on whether government compensates them for under-recoveries. Most of these companies didn’t get government support in the fiscal first half. The global business outlook for the petroleum sector is expected to be subdued, as refining players could likely see margin pressure with crude oil prices seeing downside risk if built-in growth expectations don’t fructify, say analysts.MRPL is already preparing for its future plans. Finance director LK Gupta said the company is aiming to raise Rs 4,000 crore by March 2012 to part finance its expansion. The company is expanding its refinery capacity to 15 million tonne. MRPL would import 12.1 million tonne of crude in the next fiscal year, compared with 12.5 million tonne last year. State-run Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) will lend Rs 5,000 crore to MRPL for expansion projects. Besides expanding its refining capacity, it is setting up a 450,000 tonnes a year propylene unit at an investment of Rs 1,804 crore. Both the projects are scheduled for commissioning by March 2012. “We will lend Rs 5,000 crore to MRPL at 3.85 percentage points lower than State Bank of India’s prime lending rate, which presently works out to 7.9%,” ONGC chairman and managing director RS Sharma said. Propylene can be converted into polypropylene, which is used in a wide range of industries. While MRPL will spend another Rs 5,000 crore from internal accruals, it would raise the balance Rs 4,000 crore in overseas debt by March 2012, Mr Gupta said. MRPL MD UK Bose said MRPL was ready to produce euro-iv grade petrol and would begin production of same grade diesel from April. The company may import 12.1 million tons of crude oil in 2010-11 fiscal, he said.

  NCDEX MD and CEO R Ramaseshan told reporters here that the ban issued in May 2009 was valid till September this year, and had lapsed thereafter.
  
  ""There is a possibility that sugar can be traded now. We have filed permission papers (to trade sugar) with the Forward Markets Commission (the regulatory authority),"" he said.
  
  The ban was imposed last May following steep increase in prices of sugar and with the country importing it in large quantities.
  
  Responding to reporters' queries on the Warehousing Development and Regulation Act, he said that the Warehousing Development Authority had been constituted recently and expressed confidence that it would come out with its guidelines on regulation in a year or two.
  
  ""There are better chances that the Act will become a reality soon,"" Ramaseshan said.

New rules on delivery instruction slips from October: Sebi,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/new-rules-on-delivery-instruction-slips-from-october-sebi/articleshow/37776636.cms,m.economictimes.com,New rules on delivery instruction slips from October: Sebi,"MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi today said its new framework to strengthen the supervisory and monitoring role of depositories and their participants for issuance and processing of Delivery Instruction Slips will come into force from October. 

 As per earlier plan, the new norms were to take effect from July 7. 

 A DIS is used by sellers of securities to instruct their depository participants to debit their demat account. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India, which issued the norms on issuance and processing of DIS on January 7, had said that the new framework would come into effect after six months - July 7. 

 In a circular issued today, Sebi said: ""In light of the difficulties expressed by the depositories and the depository participants (DPs) and considering their request, it has been decided to make the circular effective from October 01, 2014. 

 Further, Sebi said that a period of one month may be given for receipt of DIS by the Beneficial Owners (BO). 

 ""The DPs may accept old DIS during this transit period. Further, while issuing new DIS the DPs shall intimate the BO that old DIS cannot be used after the new DIS is received,"" regulator added. 

 According to new guidelines, depositories needs to ensure that the DIS is standardised across all depository participants in terms of serial number and layout and size of DIS to facilitate scanning and easy retrievability of records. 

 The depositories would have to prescribe a standard method of serial number and ensure that these numbers are unique. 

 Also, DPs need to ensure that same DIS will not be used for giving both market and off-market instruction. Besides, a single DIS will not be used for transactions with multiple execution dates. 

 The depositories will have to ensure that their participants have adequate infrastructure, systems and processes to implement scanning, storage and transfer of the scanned DIS in the manner specified by the depositories. 

 They also need to ensure that the systems set up by the DPs maintain proper records of all scanned DIS images and put in place adequate checks and procedures to prevent unauthorised changes."

The Rs 1,000 crore issue, which opened for subscription on December 17, has already received bids worth over Rs 22,000 crore till 11 am of Wednesday. The issue closes on Thursday.  Data available on the BSE website showed Category I investors -- which include mutual funds, insurance companies and provident funds, among others -- have bid for 40.80 times the quota limit.  Categories II and III investors, which include cooperative banks and HNIs, have seen 35.28 per cent and 17.46 per cent oversubscription, respectively. Retail investors, who come under Category IV, have bid for 8.28 times the quota limit so far. The coupon rate for retail investors will be 7.39 per cent and 7.60 per cent for tenures of 10 years and 15 years, respectively.  NHAI has kept the option open to retain oversubscriptions worth up to Rs 9,000 crore. The face value of one bond is Rs 1,000 and it is being sold in lots of five units.  About 20 per cent of the Category I-III bonds will be allotted on a first-come-first-served basis, while the rest 80 per cent will be allotted on a proportionate basis.  Similarly, for Category IV, 40 per cent of the issue size will be allotted on first-come-first-served basis; and the rest 60 per cent on a proportionate basis.  Tax-free bond issues of public sector companies have witnessed huge interest among both retail and non-retail investors in recent times.  Like bank fixed deposits (FDs), tax-free bonds offer fixed interest to subscribers. But while bank FDs attract income-tax as per the standard tax slabs (10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent), tax-free bonds allow income-tax exemptions on long-term investment gains.  While the new issues are offering lower yields of between 7.1 per cent and 7.6 per cent based on tenures, these papers are expected to see good response, especially from investors who fall in higher tax brackets.  Earlier this month, a similar bond issue from the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) was oversubscribed 10.84 times, BSE data showed. The bond was sold between December 8 and December 10, but got oversubscribed within a few hours of its opening.  An offering from NTPC witnessed similar demand, recording 11 times oversubscription on the opening day itself. The state-run power company pre-closed the issue on September 23."

ET Now: What is your own sense of the market because as we speak, we have lost a bit more, so now sub-7650 on trade, 7630 coming in there for the index? Would you initiate a fresh short at these levels? What would be your strategy on the index?  	Mitesh Thacker: On the index, I have mentioned that if we break below 7675, short positions can be taken. So a good way to trade would be to sell 7800 strike call options or buy into 7500 strike put options. My belief is that the levels of 7500 to about 7450 which we had seen in the month of June-July acted as a good support area. Those support levels could be revisited and Nifty will possibly be in the range of about 7450-7500 to 7800-7830 on the upside. So we have started the journey from the higher end of the range possibly going towards the lower end of the range."

ET Now: What are the cues for the next few days? We have the inflation take coming out, but that aside, we are probably slated to go towards the December slumber sort of thing. What according to you will happen in the near term? 

 
Vineet Bhatnagar: It is going to be a combination of two things. There will be lower activity, but it's also the time when price magnification appears amplified. Also considering the fact that it is a quarter for many managers to print their NAVs, I do not think December should close at a lower Nifty level than what we saw in November. 

 However, at the same time, I also think that the Nifty looks very tightly range-bound. If you look at the way the F&O distribution is panning out, you will see that calls are concentrated at 8600-8700. So, it is a very tight range that we are looking at. 

 If 8640 or 8650 were to be taken out, only then we will have a better idea of how it will move. But having said that, there is no sign of any weakness if I look at the charts for the Nifty."

ET Now: Lots happening in the market already first day of the week. How are you viewing the charts because we are still up about 0.5 per cent for the Nifty?  

 
Mitesh Thacker: Clearly today is an extension of the up move. We had a gap up which got filled but the index is comfortably placed above short term averages or the intraday moving averages. So the trend remains on the upside. As long as the index does not start breaking below 7640-7635, maintain a long bias and use any kind of dips to buy into the markets. The breadth is positive. That is good sign though the indices or the banking index is not doing much today despite the fact that couple of banking names are showing some kind of traction on the upside. But the overall idea is that with some kind of subduedness, with some kind of zick zack and choppiness and volatility the movement should be biased more on the upside and good chance that we will have a retest of the earlier high of 7800."
Nifty to test 6900 levels; top five trading strategies,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-to-test-6900-levels-top-five-trading-strategies/articleshow/33949723.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty to test 6900 levels; top five trading strategies,"By Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com

As we enter truncated expiry week, we maintain our view that Nifty needs to sustain above the range of 6800--6820, which would give some strength and a possible test of levels of 6850 or even 6900/6980 levels.

Readers should note that on the weekly chart Nifty closed near the resistance trend line of an upward sloping channel. In case the Nifty fails to get past the resistance of 6820 levels (on the closing basis) it could be confined in the range of 6820 on the upside and 6650 on the on the down side.

A break below 6650 levels would be negative and trigger further declines to the level of 6580/6500 levels. It must be noted that momentum indicators are pointing upward.

In nutshell, above mentioned evidences suggest that a failure to sustain 6800 level on a closing basis, would keep the nifty confined within the range of 6820 level on the upside and 6650 on the downside.

Here is a list of top five trading strategies for the coming week:

State Bank of India: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 2125, keeping stop loss at Rs 1960

The short, medium and the long term chart clearly suggest that prices are in an uptrend. It has been moving up with strong momentum from Rs 1440 levels.

Last three day’s price action has formed a small flag pattern from which it has given a breakout in today’s trading session. Traders are advised to buy above Rs 2025 levels with a stop loss placed below Rs 1960 levels for targets of Rs 2125-2175 levels.

Jindal Steel Ltd: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 305, keeping stop loss placed below Rs 265

Jindal Steel stock prices have witnessed sharp correction in past 7-8 trading sessions from the highs of Rs 304.50 to the low of Rs 265 levels. After a 7 day correction, prices have rebounded from the 200-Day Moving Average and have closed above previous day’s high with higher volumes.

Thursday’s price action suggests that the short term correction seems to be over and prices are now ready to resume its up move. We recommend traders to buy on dips to Rs 277-275 for targets of Rs 300 -305 with a stop loss below Rs 265 levels.

ONGC: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 335, keeping stop loss placed below 312.80

The share price of ONGC was trading in a falling wedge formation after finding resistace from key resistance of Rs 325. With Thursday’s up move stock registered breakout from the above mentioned pattern.

The stock is also finding support from its cluster of moving averages. The momentum indicators for ONGC are also trending upward.

We have recommended buying the stock at current price with a stop placed at Rs 312.80 level for a target of Rs 332--335 and Rs 355.

ITC Ltd: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 374, keeping stop loss below Rs 344

After witnessing highs of Rs 365 levels ITC corrected up to the levels of Rs 336.70 and found support from its cluster of moving averages. Since then the share price consolidated for few days.

	 
With last week’s up move share price registered breakout from its swing high and the momentum indicators are also trading in a bullish mode.

We recommend traders to initiate long positions at CMP for targets of Rs 365 /374. We further recommend using a stop loss placed below Rs 344 for the trade.

Tata Motors Ltd: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 460, keeping stop loss below Rs 409

Tata Motors prices are moving in a strong uptrend in to a new life high territory (no resistance zone). The weekly momentum indicators are giving strong buy signals.

We expect prices to see further upmove until prices stay above Rs 409 levels. We recommend traders to buy on dip to Rs 422-425 with a stop placed below Rs 409 for immediate target of Rs 455-460 levels.

I would go for stocks than trading Nifty50 futures. I do not think there is any conclusive evidence that we may see any trend over the next couple of days.
 
 If we go higher by say 30-40 points, nearer 8,120-8,130 we may again see some selling. So if somebody wants to take a buy or sell call, it should be made at around that 8,120-8,140 range. On the downside, I do not expect 8,000 to be broken in a hurry."

NMCE to launch select forward agri contracts this month,"{""NMCE"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/nmce-to-launch-select-forward-agri-contracts-this-month/articleshow/46212474.cms,m.economictimes.com,NMCE to launch select forward agri contracts this month,"NEW DELHI: The National Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (NMCE) plans to launch forward contracts in a number of agri commodities over the next few months. Trading in rubber, castor seed and rape seed contracts will commence this month. 

 Other contracts would be introduced based on the experience gained from the initial launch, managing director and chief executive Anil Mishra said. 

 “NMCE has got approval from the FMC (Forward Markets Commission) to launch forward contracts in 23 agri commodities,” he said. 

 Forward contracts in plantation crops like pepper, cardamom and kopra would be next in line. “We have a strong platform in plantation crops, where we see active participation of buyers and sellers to trade and hedge,” he said. 

 Potato and onion were other agriculture products which could be traded, he said. “We see a potential in forward contracts of onions and potato with delivery period of 11-12 days,” he said. 

 FMC member Nagendra Parekh said that apart from NMCE, the Multi Commodity Exchange was also preparing to offer forward contracts. Currently, the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange is offering forward contracts in 26 commodities. 

 NMCE is already holding training programmes for various stakeholders. “Government purchase and sales can also be done through this transparent national electronic platform,” he said. 

 The NMCE system would be auction-driven whereas others are having the order-driven system. “In an auction system, even if the seller has quoted a lower price, the market will decide the correct price depending upon the demand and supply,” said Mishra. “Whereas, in an order-driven system, if the seller has put an order at a lower price, and even if a buyer is available at a higher price later on, the seller would get the lower price. And, vice-versa in the case of a buyer.” 

 Forward trading is different from futures because these are customised contracts with respect to quality, date of delivery and place of delivery. “All the grades of a commodity can be traded in forward contract hence the scope will be much larger for hedging. The delivery locations also will be many as compared to limited delivery locations in case of futures contract,” Mishra said."

 “Sector-wise, autos, pharma and telecom delivered positive surprises on EBITDA, while electrical equipment was the key miss,” said Nomura report. 

 In terms of strategy, the brokerage continues to prefer exporters, and private banks among rate cyclicals, but remains cautious on domestic growth cyclicals. It expects the Sensex to touch 22,000 by March-end. 

 
Following are top five investment ideas that can give healthy returns in the long term as the economy improves: 

 
HCL Technologies: Our target price of Rs 1,400 is based on 15x one-year-forward EPS of Rs 93, which is a 20 per cent premium to the stock's five-year average one-year forward P/E given 1) better EPS growth and margin trajectory; 2) improving cash generation and return profile; and 3) lower risks due to pushback of US immigration bill. The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price include a worse-than-expected slowdown, failure to exhibit stability in margins, and rupee appreciation against the USD. 

 
ICICI Bank: We arrive at our target price of Rs 1,300 by valuing the subsidiaries on a sum-of-the-parts basis at Rs 240 and using a three-stage residual-income valuation method for core banking business. 

 At our target price for the core bank, ICICI would trade at 1.7x our average FY14/15F ABV of Rs 624 and 11.9x average FY14/15F EPS of Rs 89.1 for an ROE of 15.5 per cent by FY15F. 

 The stock is currently trading at 1SD below its five-year mean. Given the strong earning trajectory, we expect ICICI to outperform the market. At our TP, the bank would trade slightly above its five-year mean P/ABV. 

 Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price are significant deterioration in asset quality and lower loan growth than expected by us. 

 
NTPC: Our target price of Rs 193 for NTPC is based on a sum of the fair value of its operating assets using a residual income (RI) model (Rs 101) + FY14F CWIP (Rs 57) + FY14F investment in JVs/subsidiaries (Rs 7) and non-operating financial assets (Rs 27). Our RI model assumes 13 per cent cost of equity, 15.5 per cent perpetual ROE (on regulated assets), and 2 per cent perpetual growth in core business income. The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Key risks include a decline in operational efficiency-linked incentives from FY13 levels, delays in commercial capacity accretion timelines and progress on bulk tender projects, tardy development of captive coal blocks, and a FY15-19 regulatory tariff regime that materially erodes profitability. 

 
Reliance Industries: We use the sum-of-the-parts valuation method to value RIL’s different businesses. For its core businesses, we use EV/EBITDA multiples. We use a 7x FY15F EV/EBITDA multiple for its refining and petrochemical business. We use DCF to value the company's new E&P business. Our target price is Rs 1,075 per share.The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Key downside risks are 1) deterioration in refining margins; 2) weakness in petrochemical margins; 3) further delays in the ramp-up of KG-D6 production volume; and 4) a sharper rupee appreciation versus the US dollar. 

 
Tata Steel: We value Tata Steel on an SOTP valuation, with our target price of Rs 443 consisting of Rs 615 (6x FY15F EV/EBITDA) for India operations, negative INR185 for Europe operations (5x FY15F EV/EBITDA), and INR13 for stakes in other businesses.The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price: We have built in steel prices corresponding to Chinese export prices of $560/tonne for FY14-15 as against a current price range of $600/tonne. However, if prices are worse than our expectations, there could be downside risks to our estimates. 

 We have built in 13.3-13.5 million tonnes of deliveries for European operations in FY14-15, down from 14 million tonnes in FY12. If the demand situation is worse than expected, there could be downside risk to our estimates."

  The bourse has received approval from the capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of Indian and the RBI for introducing exchange traded currency options on US Dollar -Indian Rupee Spot rate, NSE said in a statement.
  
  ""Currency options contracts will be launched in the currency derivatives segment of the exchange on Friday,"" it added.
  
  The introduction of currency options will provide an alternative to investors for hedging against currency fluctuations.
  
  A derivative instrument, currency option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to exchange money denominated in one currency into another at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date.
  
  ""To begin with the exchanges shall offer three consecutive monthly contracts and 1 quarterly contract. New contracts shall be issued on expiration of an existing month contract,"" the NSE added.
  
  According to the bourse, USD-INR options contracts shall expire at 12 noon, two working days prior to the last business day of the expiry month.
  
  The Reserve Bank of India and Sebi jointly regulate these products. While RBI approves the products, Sebi decides on the trading platforms.
  
  Worldwide, the currency derivatives market is bigger than the equities market.
  
  Earlier this month, Sebi gave its nod to the NSE and the BSE-backed United Stock Exchange for starting trade in currency options, but another bourse MCX-SX blamed the market regulator for discrimination against it, saying thet it was yet to get the approval.
  
  At present, futures trading in four currency pairs is being offered through the exchanges. These pairs are Dollar- Rupee, Euro-Rupee, Yen-Rupee and Pound-Rupee.
  
  In July this year, Sebi allowed bourses to introduce currency options on the US dollar pairing with the rupee.
  
  Two year ago, the market regulator allowed exchanges to introduce currency futures, a forex derivative contract to buy or sell one currency against other on a specified future date, at a price decided in the contract.
  
  Initially, currency futures were limited to rupee-dollar only. But in January 2010, it was extended to three more currencies--the euro, the British pound sterling and the Japanese yen--pairing with the rupee."

 The industry is also expecting that the Union government may come out with the decision about extending export incentives any time, which will help the industry deal with surplus sugar and avoid distress sugar sale as well as pay the mandatory fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugar cane. 

 Almost 70% of the sugar mills in Maharashtra have received legal notices from the sugar commissioner for non-payment of the FRP within the stipulated 15 day period after cane delivery to the mill. ""We have sent legal notices for non-payment of FRP to 119 mills under the Sugarcane Control Order,"" said Vipin Sharma, commissioner of sugar, Maharashtra. Barring a few exceptions, almost all the mills in Maharashtra are paying less than the FRP. Rajendra Girme, chairman and managing director of Sasvad Mali sugar mill said: ""We have given a written reply to the notice sent to us stating that we will be able to pay the FRP only if we get government assistance"". Some of the sugar mills in largest sugar producer Maharashtra had done advance sale of sugar at distress price. 

 Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said: ""There is no need for the sugar mills to go in for distress sale because about 1.5 million tonne to 2 million tonne of excess sugar will be taken care by the Centre's export incentives scheme. The OMCs have come out with EoI to purchase ethanol at Rs 42 per litre at factory gate. This is adequate to incentivise conversion of surplus sugar by some distilleries into ethanol to take care of the surplus sugar."" 

 During the tenure of the earlier government, sugar mills were getting Rs 3,300 tonne assistance for sugar exports. Now, the mills are expecting to get Rs 4,000tonne assistance as international prices have declined further. 

 As the sugarcane crushing in the country is in full swing, India is poised to have a fifth consecutive year of surplus sugar production.Maharashtra has already crushed 250 lakh tonne sugar and another 550 lakh tonne remains to be crushed. 

 The crushing is likely to continue even till MayJune in districts like Solapur and Pune where the area under cane increased substantially last year."

""We are not in any discussions with Dodsal or with anyone else for Pizza Hut or any other pizza business,"" Vishal Nevatia, managing partner and chief executive of IVFA, said in an email reply. 

 Spokespersons for the Rajen Dodsal Group and Multiples did not respond to ET’s queries on the matter. The Kilachand family, the owners of Dodsal, wants to focus on its engineering and construction business in the Middle East, and exit the quick-service food business which it operates with 86 retail restaurants.Pizza Hut, KFC and Tacobel are three flagship brands of USbased Yum!

 Dodsal owns the franchise rights to the Pizza Hut outlets in south and west India and runs six KFC quick-service restaurants in Mumbai and Bangalore. The Pizza Hut chain in north and east India is run by Ravi Jaipuria-owned Devyani International. This is the Dodsal group’s second attempt at selling stake in its retail chain business. 

 In 2009, the promoters were close to selling between 30% and 40% to private equity fund New Silk Route, but the deal fell through on valuation mismatches. The company is now valued at about 10 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or operating profit. 

 The Dodsal group diversified into the food service industry in 1997.

Tracking the momentum, the index may reclaim its crucial psychological level of 7,800 in trade today.
 
 At 08:00 A.M., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 31.50 points higher at 7,811 indicating a higher opening on the domestic market.
 
 Sensex and Nifty recovered 408 and 134 points respectively on fresh buying in rate-sensitive stocks amid rising hopes of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank for the week ended September 11.
 
 Indian market would also react to Industrial production data which rose 4.2 per cent in July, just a shade below the upward revised figure of 4.4 per cent in June, according to data released by the statistics office post market hours on Friday.
 
 But, movement of index in this week will depend on CPI data to be announced on 14th September 2015, and the US Fed's policy-making committee which will hold a two-day meeting on 16th and 17th September 2015.
 
 ""The Fed next week will be important, but, to be honest, we do not see too much downside risk than upside risk as the opinion on the next week's Fed move is divided on street. We believe markets have already started discounting a 25 basis point hike by Fed,"" says Vikas Singhania, Executive Director, Trade Smart Online.
 
 ""Next week will also see the expiry of September Futures in the US and European markets. So, global markets would be volatile but downside limited. We expect a strong directional move on upside if Nifty sustains above 7,850 spot level else consolidation will contain,"" he added.
 
 A hike in interest rate in the US is likely to drain liquidity from emerging markets like India and redirect it to developed economies, say experts.
 
 On the macro-economic front, the IIP data will have a major bearing on the decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the next phase of rate cuts during its upcoming monetary policy meet on September 29.
 
 Technically, in daily charts Nifty Future is looking weak and short term trend is down. However, a relief rally can be seen till Nifty future is trading above the levels of 7,660 for targets of 7,900 to 7970, as bearish head and shoulder pattern's target is yet not achieved.
 
 ""On the daily charts Nifty Future is looking weak and short term trend is down. Nifty is expected to head southward as deeper correction up to 7400 - 7200 can be seen in short term,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
 
 ""On down side immediate support level is at 7660. On the upside immediate resistance is at 7930 levels,"" he added.
 
 On Friday, US rose, and the S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly gain since July as investors weighed whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, said a Reuters report.
 
 Investors are awaiting next week's Fed monetary policy meeting and news on whether it will raise benchmark U.S. rates for the first time in almost a decade, added the report.
 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.69 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 16,433.09, the S&P 500 gained 8.76 points, or 0.45 per cent, to 1,961.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.09 points, or 0.54 per cent, to 4,822.34.

Pricing power is the key in FMCG: Prateek Agarwal,"{""FMCG"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/pricing-power-is-the-key-in-fmcg-prateek-agarwal/articleshow/21159659.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pricing power is the key in FMCG: Prateek Agarwal,"In a chat with ET Now, Prateek Agarwal, CIO, ASK Investment Manager shares his views on FMCG sector. Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: Your thoughts on FMCG? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: When I say FMCG may not mean only the FMCG companies it may also mean stuff that tier 2 towns and villages consume so insecticide, pesticide companies are something that we are glued on, seed companies are something that we are glued on also. FMCG companies which have pricing power so as of now in the market every FMCG company is moving up but not all categories have pricing power. 

 
ET Now: Within the FMCG sector where should one lean, should one buy into classic defensives like HUL or ITC or it is now time to really go down the ladder, look at a Dabur, look at a Marico, it is time to revisit to Colgate or may be addin a Britannia? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: I will give you the broad contours of our thought process. We do not like single product FMCG companies. We like ones with a basket of brands. So when if you are talking derisking then if you have a single product led company that adds an element of risk whatever may be the markets share. We like companies with strong brands and pricing power. 

 You may have a strong position in the market but you may still not have pricing power. So that is something else to be kept in mind. Valuations across the board in FMCG leave very little to any kind of accidents. They are really stretched, to some extent I would want to believe that the money which have come back from HUL buyback is going to the same space again so may be it make sense to wait out a bit and let the stock settle. In vast majority of the FMCG stocks valuations are peakish."

 The Mumbai-based firm, which is also into tiles (TBK) and ready-mix concrete (RMC), had clocked Rs 47.87 crore net loss in the same quarter last fiscal, it said in a statement. 

 Total income during the period rose to Rs 1,389 crore mainly due to higher revenue from cement and TBK businesses, as against Rs 1,134 crore in the year-ago quarter. It sold 15.39 lakh tonnes cement and clicker during the June quarter, generating Rs 600 crore sales. 

 ""The margins of the cement division improved as compared to the corresponding quarter last year on account of cost saving measures implemented and revival of demand in the markets of interest,"" it said. 

 The Tile Bath Kitchen (TBK) segment's revenue grew by 27 per cent to Rs 490 crore due to higher capacity utilisastion. 

 The company said RMC division witnessed some early signs of recovery, but the profitability of the division continued to be under pressure due to lower capacity utilisation and increase in costs, especially fuel. 

 ""During the quarter, Prism Trust has sold its entire holding of 1,23,51,600 equity shares held in the company. The company is the beneficiary of the Trust...The Trust has realised approx Rs 88 crore at an average price of about Rs 71.50 per share from this sales transaction,"" it said.

Private sector is more promising than PSU bank stocks,"{""PSU bank stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/private-sector-is-more-promising-than-psu-bank-stocks/articleshow/32755588.cms,m.economictimes.com,Private sector is more promising than PSU bank stocks,"PSU bank stocks are down and out. The State Bank of India has plunged to Rs 1,741 from Rs 2,051, Canara Bank has fallen toRs245 from Rs371, and Bank of India has tumbled to Rs205 from Rs289 in a span of a year. Many PSU banks are trading below their book value. Bank of India trades at a P/BV of 0.54, while Canara Bank trades at a P/BV of 0.48. SBI is trading at a P/BV of 1.31. Despite these beaten down valuations, there are no takers for these stocks.
 
 Analysts continue to prefer private sector banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, among others, despite a spurt in stock prices and rise in valuations. Stocks of HDFC Bank have moved up to Rs750 fromRs610, Kotak Bank to Rs765 from Rs631 and ICICI Bank to Rs1,250 from Rs1,012. HDFC Bank trades at a P/BV of 4.9, while ICICI trades at a P/BV of 2.1.
 
 Analysts justify their preference for private banks by citing a host of parameters: lower NPAs, gain in market share, better disclosures and continuity in top management, and so on. “Private banks are preferred due to their high quality portfolio, aggressive management, higher transparency and focus on the retail segment,” says Sadanand Shetty, senior V-P and fund manager, Taurus Mutual Fund. Others also point towards the deteriorating financial health of state-run banks.
 
 “Due to rising bad debt, public sector banks will remain dependent on the government for capital infusion. This will dilute the book value and lead to lower returns in the long run,” says Dipen Shah, head (PCG Research), Kotak Securities
 
 Way Ahead of Competition In the last two decade, private sector banks — ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank and so on — have been gaining market share at the expense of state-run banks. For example, they have increased their current account savings account market share to 17 per cent in 2013 from 14 per cent in 2009. “The focus on retail segment has helped new private sector banks in the last five years when the economy passed through a slowdown,” says Alpesh Mehta, banking analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities.
 
 
 
 
  
 
 However, public sector banks continued to focus on the corporate loan segment in this period, which proved to be a bad strategy. “With consumption pattern changing further in favour of discretionary spending, good growth is likely in consumer loans, namely home loans, auto loans and credit cards,” says Mehta. With private sector banks eyeing growth in semi-urban and rural areas, they are likely to further eat into the existing market share of staterun banks, say analysts.
 
 Quality of management and higher disclosures are other favourable factors attracting investors towards private sector banks. “PSU bank chiefs see frequent changes, giving them very little time to execute. Compared to this, private sector banks have seen higher management continuity,” says Alok Ranjan, portfolio manager, Way2Wealth. For example, Aditya Puri and team has been leading HDFC Bank for the last 20 years. Ranjan asks investors to bet on HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank with 2-3-year horizon. “Private banks are more transparent and open than public sector banks,” says Sadanand Shetty.
 
 NPAs Continue to Drag PSU Banks According to RBI data, net NPAs of PSU banks rose to 2.02per cent in 2012-13 from 1.53per cent in the previous year. Net NPAs of private sector banks rose marginally to 0.45per cent from 0.42per cent during the same period. PSU banks have resorted to restructuring of loans to avoid bad debt. Restructured accounts have grown at a CAGR of 47.86per cent in PSU banks against 8.12per cent for private sector banks."
Pyramid Saimira case: Sebi completes probe against five entities,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/pyramid-saimira-case-sebi-completes-probe-against-five-entities/articleshow/28429091.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pyramid Saimira case: Sebi completes probe against five entities,"MUMBAI: The Sebi has brought to closure its probe against five entities involved in fraudulent trades in Pyramid Saimira shares, one of the biggest insider trading cases in Indian capital markets, even as proceedings have been initiated against the main accused Nirmal Kotecha. 

 While all five entities have been found ""facilitating, aiding and abetting principal offender Nirmal Kotecha in his nefarious securities market related activities"", the Sebi said four of them have already undergone the required debarment from the securities markets for more than four years since interim orders were issued against them. 

 As a result, the restraining order against the four, which also includes two entities indirectly controlled by Nirmal Kotecha, have been removed. 

 Passing final orders against them, the Sebi however said another entity, Nirman Management Services (presently known as Teakwood Management Services), would undergo debarment from the securities market for a period of total seven years for facilitating Kotecha in his fraudulent dealings. 

 The period of debarment already undergone by this entity since passage of Sebi's interim order of April 23, 2009 would be taken into account for this seven-year restraint order, the regulator said. 

 The Sebi also said its decision to remove restrictions from four entities is ""without prejudice to the proceedings which have been initiated vis-a-vis Nirmal Kotecha"". 

 The matters relate to one of the biggest cases of insider trading and fraudulent trade. A former promoter Nirmal Kotecha sold a huge number of shares of Pyramid Saimira Theatres in December 2008 after dissemination of false information in media based on a forged Sebi letter asking promoter PS Saminathan to make an open offer. 

 The forged Sebi letter was alleged to have been planned and executed by Kotecha himself and persons working with him. 

 Taking action in the case, the Sebi had passed interim orders against more than 200 entities, including Saminathan and Kotecha, on April 23, 2009, barring them from capital markets. 

 The four entities, including Nirmal's mother Veena Kotecha and grandfather Manilal Kotecha, were barred from the markets at that time for permitting Nirmal Kotecha to use their bank accounts for his fraudulent funding activities. 

 The Sebi probe later found that Kotecha and entities associated with him, including his friends and relatives, made significant undue profit from the publication of forged letter and the consequent trading activities, which enabled them to offload substantial holdings in shares of Pyramid Saimira. 

 In different final orders on these four, passed on January 3, the Sebi said the four-years-and-eight-month period of ban already undergone by them will ""broadly commensurate"" for the the charge of aiding and abetting Nirmal Kotecha in violating PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations. 

 In the case of Nirman Management, the Sebi said by allowing its director, Nirmal Kotecha, to use its bank account for funding activities which operated as a fraud on genuine investors, the entity had ""indeed aided and abetted Nirmal Kotecha and thus violated provisions of...the PFUTP Regulations"". 

 However, the market regulator said ""the period of prohibition already undergone by Nirman Management Services pursuant to Sebi ad interim order dated April 23, 2009 shall be taken into account for the purpose of computing seven years of prohibition imposed in this order""."

 People will start having that weightage in the or their presence in the portfolio mainly on two accounts. One, of course, is the gas price possibilities and upsides and second is the newer opportunities opening up both in oil and gas and other sectors which can give fillip to the stocks.

 RIL, which had posted a net profit of Rs 5352 crore for the Apr – June 2013 quarter, is expected to report a similar number for the Apr – June 2014 quarter, which will be a drop of around 5% from Rs 5631 crore posted in immediately preceding quarter of Jan – Mar 2014.
 
 Both the main businesses of the company are expected to face margin pressure during the Apr – June 2014 quarter. “We expect RIL to report GRMs of $8.6 per barrel compared to $9.3 in Jan – Mar 2014 quarter,” mentioned a report from Morgan Stanley.

Fundamentally do you think a new bull market has started? 

 
Kunj Bansal: I will put it in like this, obviously the market has been going up. We have seen significant amount of investor interest which obviously given the India’s market cap, liquidity and the depth comes largely from FIIs but that is just a segment of the market in my view. 

 Now why this interest has come in. There is a general perception that because of the political expectation of a stable government and that too by a certain particular coalition. I have slightly different thought that in my view, maybe that is not the only reason or certainly that is not the main reason, maybe that is a supportive reason. 

 What is the reason is that there has been significant improvement in the macroeconomic numbers of the country and part of that credit we have to give it to current government. Now keeping the credit and debit aside coming back to what are those macroeconomic numbers, we have clearly seen inflation significantly coming down. 

 We have clearly seen the trade deficit and current deficit coming down which is what has resulted in currency remaining strengthened to whatever it is currently in absolute terms and even compared to the other relative...
 
 
ET Now: What would lead the market higher because now there is this big debate about whether one sticks with cyclicals or should one stay put with IT, pharma, the ones which have already worked for you? 

 
Kunj Bansal: Let us again put this very briefly in some numbers. Today, currently the Nifty is 6,750 odd yesterday’s closing. Now let us take the next psychological good number as 7,000 which will be about 5 per cent rise. 

 That 5 per cent will be led by what, obviously it will have to be some high weighted Nifty stocks. So to answer your question, Reliance is the one which has already participated one but will continue to participate in a bigger way. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank participated in the initial part of the rally but have not participated in last 100-150 points from the rally. They will be the ones which will come back and Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. They are the ones who have not participated as much will be ones which will participate. 

 I somehow do not feel that Infy and TCS will be the leaders in this next round of 5-6 per cent rally of the market.

Kunj Bansal: No, this is purely based on the momentum that is there in the market. Such a short term movement of the market in my view probably cannot be predicted or cannot be justified on the reasonings of valuations or fundamentals. 

 
ET Now: So you are saying it will be 7000 within this month?

Rice bran oil set to smoke out olive oil,"{""Rice bran oil"": ""positive"", ""olive oil"": ""negative""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/rice-bran-oil-set-to-smoke-out-olive-oil/articleshow/19718424.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rice bran oil set to smoke out olive oil,"You can just forget about cooking with olive oil to stay fit. Olive oil production in Spain has been hit hard by a drought, which has pushed up prices by 40%. This has prompted rice bran oil companies like Adani Wilmar, Ricela Health Food and Sethia Oils to swing into action to take a slice of this market, which largely comprises the urban youth. These oil companies are organising health workshops in office premises to push their products that are much cheaper than olive oil but have the same health values. 

 The companies are planning to scale up the rice bran oil production to ensure a continuous supply in the market. Anghsu Mallick, chief operating officer of Adani Wilmar, told ET: “We have launched Fortune rice bran oil that has been well accepted in the market. Our customers are largely the urban young people. They generally prefer light cooking oil like olive oil. 

 But this year, there has been a shortage of olive crop in Spain and this has pushed up prices. We are trying to capture this market as rice bran oil is also a light cooking medium and has similar health values.” 

 Total production of olive oil for five months since October 2012 was 5,96,000 tonne — 62% down compared to the same period last season, according to the latest market report from Spain’s Olive Oil Agency. The next harvest outlook is also not very bright as heavy rains this month have increased the occurrence of olive leaf spot, which could reduce production. 

 In 2011-2012, imports grew to 7,163 tonne, registering a growth of 42%. European olive oils continue to dominate imports with about 85%, of which 48% came from Spain and 36% from Italy. 

 Priyanshi Patel, VP (international business) of NK Proteins, said: “According to data available, we can see that from last year, there is a 40% price rise in olive oil that has factored in the current drought. From June-end, we should expect a revision of rates.” 

 But that is not stopping rice bran oil companies to use every opportunity to push their product. Mallick said: “We are organising health workshops at IT companies and housing societies in Mumbai and Delhi to create an awareness about rice bran oil. 

 In fact, we have appointed dieticians to explain the benefits of rice bran oil to the urban youth. We now produce 30,000 tonne of edible oil but we will shortly sca le it up to 40,000 tonne per annum.” AR Sharma, chairman of largest rice bran oil company Ricela Health Food, said: “There is a huge potential for rice bran oil. 

 Now, only 9 lakh tonne is produced though it can go up to 15 lakh tonne. Of the 9 lakh tonne, only 2 lakh tonne is available in the market in packed form.”"

Sudip Bandyopadhyay: It is a landmark thing the way the currency has appreciated over the last few days but one must remember it is culmination of two-three factors. One is lot of money is being brought in by the FIIs, two is we had this Axis Bank sale by SUUTI and lot of foreign money did come in through that route as well that was quite a chunk. We also have seen inflows into Indian debt consistently. So combination of these three factors led to lot of dollar moving into India and to an extent RBI has been trying to slowdown the pace but the dollar flow was too much for them to handle and we have a currency which has appreciated so sharply. I would not say this is very healthy and I would not say this is sustainable. We believe that at some stage we will see the correction and rupee will probably stabilised around 61-62 levels."

  Rel Comm, what would you do with this one. It has bounced up a big 173 would you initiate any trade on this one? 
  
  RComm is actually giving some positive signals around 2009 bottom like it has been taking a very good support and particularly all the telecom companies are taking support and they are bouncing back. I think this telecom sector the big issue is that I don’t think there is a much downside from here they are going to perform better than the other stock which have been doing well till now and these stocks have been underperforming though I wouldn’t take a buy call immediately at these level because still it’s a range bound and you can see RComm going back to 140 but at a lower level definitely one can accumulate for a very long term even other stock something like Bharti and Idea.
  
  Overall I feel this is a neutral stock and below 165 it will have some kind of a negative bias for the short term and right now I feel like one should hold it if somebody is holding it for a long term portfolio and for a short term traders one can keep a stop loss below 165 closing basis and can hold this stock for little more bounce but I feel overall the scenario seems to be a range bound for these stocks."

The Sebi board, which met in Delhi on Thursday, also made it mandatory for companies to disclose CEO compensation.
 
 Further, Sebi recommended tax incentives for mutual funds and proposed that the Employee Provident Fund Organisation should invest 15% of its corpus in equities and MF schemes. It announced higher net worth need for asset management companies, apparently aimed at weeding out smaller funds.
 
 The new rules restrict the tenure of independent directors to two five-year terms. Directors nominated by the company's promoter cannot be classified as an independent director, Sebi said.
 
 Companies will now have to disclose remuneration policies of CEOs and executive directors, related-party transactions and appointment and resignations of independent directors.
 
 These rules are aimed at aligning corporate governance norms to best global practices and to the new Companies Act of 2013, said Sebi chairman UK Sinha. ""We have decided that there will be a compensation committee that has to be headed by an independent director. The committee will first (have to) put in place a remuneration policy and it will be fixing the remuneration of key managerial persons.
 
 We have concentrated on the process of fixing remuneration,"" Sinha told reporters in Delhi after the board meeting. ""Sebi's new norms to be effective October 1, 2014 are in the right direction and go a long way to change the corporate governance paradigm. The norms empower minority shareholders to be more informed and to easily exercise their votes,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director, InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm.
 
 Sebi said, in case a person is a whole time director in a listed company, then he can only be on three boards. ""If somebody has already been independent director for more than five years, then he can get only one extra term of five years,"" Sinha said. The regulator has also made it mandatory for companies to have an orderly succession plan for appointments to the board and senior management, a whistle blowing policy and to appoint at least one woman director on its board, besides empowering minority shareholders to approve related-party transactions.
 
 Some of these changes may attract criticism. Recently, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had criticised any move to cap the number of board memberships for independent directors, saying there is a paucity of directors.
 
 MF Policy The Sebi board also announced higher net worth requirements for asset management companies. ""The minimum capital requirement for an asset management company has been increased from Rs 10 crore to Rs 50 crore.
 
 ""There are 19 companies today who have less than Rs 50 crore of capital and a share of 6% in total assets under management. They have been given a time frame of three years to reach that particular level,"" Sinha said.
 
 ""Increasing the net worth requirement for mutual funds is not a good idea because you need smart managers to manage the portfolios and not the rich managers,"" said Sandeep Parekh, founder, Finsec Law Advisor.
 
 ""The Rs 50-crore net worth criteria is a negative step as this does not guarantee greater financial inclusion or seriousness. Only larger players will dominate the market, which is not good for retail investors,"" said Jimmy Patel, CEO, Quantum AMC.
 
 Sebi also proposed that EPFO, a government body which manages savings of employees in the organised sector, should be allowed to invest up to 15% of its corpus in equities and mutual funds. Further, members of EPFO who are earning more thanRs 6,500 a month should be given an option that a part of their corpus could be invested in a MF product. The regulator has also proposed tax incentives for equity mutual funds.
 
 To encourage MFs to participate in corporate governance of the investee companies and exercise their voting rights, the regulator has ordered fund houses to disclose voting data along with rationale supporting their decision (for, against or abstain) on a quarterly basis on their website."

 In his interim budget speech, Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the government plans to ""create one record for all financial assets of every individual"". 

 The move is expected to help ease doing business for individuals as well as financial sector entities, including banks, insurers, mutual funds, brokers and others. 

 Following directions from capital markets regulator Sebi, a centralised KYC database has already been set up for all segments under its jurisdiction ,including mutual funds and brokerage firms. 

 Now, Sebi has cleared a proposal to allow market intermediaries to access investor details from these agencies, rather than carry out a fresh KYC verification procedure. 

 According to latest data available with Sebi, as many as 1.87 crore investors have provided KYC details to five KRAs (KYC Registration Agencies) registered with the market regulator at the end of December 2013. 

 ""KRA system has been working smoothly and with inter-operability, there is easy exchange of KYC data among 5 Sebi registered KRAs,"" Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said. 

 ""As the system has stabilised and large number of clients have on-boarded into the KRA system, it is felt that there may not be a need to provide an option to the intermediary to seek documents already available on the KRA system from a KYC compliant client,"" it added. 

 Presently, market entities such as brokers and mutual funds have the option to either access the client information available with KRAs or carry out fresh KYC process. 

 However, Sebi observed that the option of taking fresh KYCs was provided in the regulations ""to ensure that intermediaries equip themselves to the concept of KRA system, as the new system was expected to stabilise in due course"". 

 The concept of the KRA system is been replicated by the Ministry of Finance which is working towards establishing a Central KYC system for the entire financial sector. 

 CDSL Ventures Limited (CVL), NSDL Database Management Limited (NDML), DotEx International Limited (DotEx), CAMS Investor Services and Karvy Data Management Services are the Sebi registered KRAs. 

 In course of time, the government intends to have one KYC norm across all financial sector regulators - including those for the banking, capital market, insurance and pension sectors."

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has found hundreds of entities to have devised such unauthorised schemes to launder black money and evade taxes and is currently probing many other such cases.
 
 
While Sebi has taken interim action against these entities by barring them from the markets, it has also suggested further probe by other agencies for tax evasion and other irregularities, a senior official said.
 
 
In its meeting last week, Sebi's board was apprised of the surveillance action taken in this regard, which included interim orders passed in two such cases involving illicit tax-free gains running into hundreds of crores of rupees.
 
 
In the first order, Sebi barred Mishka Finance, its 6 promoters, 4 directors and 170 other entities from accessing securities market and prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing in securities till further directions.
 
 
Sebi had suo motu carried an examination after noticing an exorbitant rise in trading volume and share price of Mishka.
 
 
It was found that the company along with its promoters and directors issued new shares through preferential allotment to certain entities. Further, the promoters transferred their holding in physical form to related entities, while price of the scrip increased astronomically despite low volumes.
 
 
One month after share split, the preferential allottees and promoter related entities started selling the shares to entities related to Mishka, thereby making huge profits.
 
 
""It appears that the stock market mechanism was used by the company, its promoters and related entities for booking Long-Term Capital Gains of Rs 254 crore approximately and converting their unaccounted income into accounted one.
 
 
""These connected entities are offloading these shares by indulging in trading in an artificial, manipulative and unfair manner,"" Sebi said.
 
 
In the second case, Sebi restrained Pine Animation group, their promoters and related entities, their directors along with their preferential allottee and exit providers (total of 178 entities) from markets till further directions.
 
 
Sebi said the typical modus operandi of allotting shares on a preferential basis, announcing a stock split and then bringing in connected entities to provide exit was a scheme devised to make ill-gotten gains.
 
 
It included pumping the share price artificially and then dumping the price so that the same cycle could be repeated.
 
 
""Also the mechanism is presumably being used to deceive the authorities by laundering black money and making tax-free profits. Further, the order mentions that the issue requires further investigation from the forensic angle,"" Sebi said."

 The proposed norms are likely to be discussed by Sebi's board soon, sources said. 

 The regulator may first issue draft regulations, on which comments would be sought from all stakeholders before deciding the final norms. 

 The proposed new regime would also require other regulatory changes, including by RBI and the Tax Department, sources added. 

 This would be on the lines of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trust) and InViTs (Infrastructure Investment Trust). 

 Bond and other securities based on renewable energy are also under Sebi's consideration. 

 A 'YieldCo' is a publicly listed company that is formed to own assets that generate a predictable cash flow, primarily through long-term contracts. 

 In this model, the cost of capital is lowered by separation of volatile assets like development, research and construction. 

 The model, which has already been gaining ground in the US and some other markets, is used in the renewable energy sector to protect the investors against regulatory changes. 

 Under this model, the investors get the annual returns like a dividend and the capital remains invested for the long term. 

 Besides, there are tax incentives to make this model attractive. 

 In the past couple of years, billions of dollars have been raised by American and European companies through IPOs of YieldCos, which are first spun off from their main business and then get listed separately. 

 According to a USIBC report, there may be opportunities to explore the YieldCo dividend model specifically for Indian smart cities.

 ""...hereby order to attach all demat account/s by whatever name called of the defaulter, either singly or jointly with any person/s, held by you,"" it added. 

 As per the regulator's directions ""no debit"" are allowed from the accounts, however, ""credits, if any, into the account into the account maybe allowed"". 

 In December 2012, the market regulator had directed MPS Greenery Developers to close its Collective Investment Schemes and refund the investors within one month, failing which proceedings would be initiated against the entity and its senior officials."

The recovery proceedings against Mukesh G Konde for Rs 22.61 lakh, includes further interest, all costs, charges and expenses, Sebi said in an attachment order issued on Tuesday. 

 In its notice, Sebi asked all banks, depositories and mutual funds not to allow any debit from accounts of Konde. However, credits have been permitted. 

 Further, the markets watchdog has directed all banks to attach all accounts including lockers held by the defaulters. 

 There is sufficient reason to believe that the defaulter may dispose of the securities in the account held by you and realisation of amount due under the certificate would in consequence be delayed or obstructed. 

 In order to protect the interest of investors, it is necessary to attach the assets of the defaulters, including bank, demat accounts and mutual fund investments, to prevent any alienation of the same, it added. 

 In June 2016, the regulator levied a fine of Rs 90 lakh on Konde and eight other entities in a matter pertaining to non-genuine transactions in RTS Power Corporation's scrip. 

 It was found that three individuals had bought shares of the company on February 11, 2009, and failed to fulfill their respective pay-in obligations. 

 Besides, certain other individuals had entered into the sham transactions with the defaulting clients who were related to them and aided the defaulting clients in prejudicing the integrity of the securities market. 

 One of the defaulting clients was Mukesh G Konde. 

 Meanwhile, in another attachment order, the regulator has ordered the bank and demat accounts of Edelweiss Estates Pvt Ltd to recover over Rs 5 lakh in the matter of GDR issue of six companies. 

 The recovery proceedings have been initiated against Edelweiss Estates Pvt Ltd (now known as Edelweiss Research Pvt Ltd) after it failed to pay the fine imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in June 2021.

"Sebi proposes including family trusts, NBFCs in QIB segment","{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sebi-proposes-including-family-trusts-nbfcs-in-qib-segment/articleshow/46784831.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi proposes including family trusts, NBFCs in QIB segment","NEW DELHI: Markets regulator Sebi has proposed including 'systematically important' NBFCs and some registered family trusts in the Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) category, a move that will put such entities at par with institutional investors like banks and mutual funds. 

 Further, the market watchdog has suggested that any other entity registered with Sebi and having a minimum networth of Rs 500 crore may also be considered as a QIB. 

 At present, QIBs are defined under Sebi regulations as those institutional investors, who are generally perceived to possess expertise and the financial muscle to evaluate and invest in capital markets. 

 The existing QIBs include public financial institutions like scheduled commercial banks, mutual funds, foreign institutional investor and venture capital funds. 

 In a new proposal, Sebi has said that the definition of QIBs ""may be extended to include systematically important NBFCs as per RBI guidelines and family offices/ trusts, subject to such family offices/trust registering itself as Alternate Investment Funds (AIF)."" 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought public comments till April 20 for this proposal, which is part of a draft paper on setting up an Alternate Capital Raising platform for start-ups. 

 The move is aimed at helping such companies raise funds from within India and stop their flight to overseas markets. 

 Under the proposed alternate capital raising platform, money should be raised only from institutions and high networth individuals by the new-age companies having innovative business model and belonging to knowledge-based technology sector. However, retail investors would be restricted from investing in such companies. 

 The regulator came out with this proposal after taking into account suggestions made by Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) of Sebi. 

 The proposals on QIB would be applicable to all issuers irrespective of the listing on main board or the institutional platform."
Sebi to revisit policy on proprietary trading by brokers,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-to-revisit-policy-on-proprietary-trading-by-brokers/articleshow/29045809.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi to revisit policy on proprietary trading by brokers,"NEW DELHI: To ring-fence small investors from any manipulation by brokers, market regulator Sebi is considering revisiting its policy on proprietary trades. 

 Such trades are conducted by brokers for their own gains and not for the clients. 

 Brokers are required to make strict disclosures about their proprietary trades and ensure a 'Chinese Wall' like structure between these trading activities and the trades conducted by them on behalf of their clients. 

 However, many cases have come to fore in the recent past where some brokers were found indulging in manipulative activities involving their proprietary trades, while in certain cases, clients' money has been misused for their own trading interest as well, officials said. 

 Cases like the NSEL crisis have also revealed possible manipulations by brokers and Sebi has therefore decided to revisit its policy on proprietary trades, they added. 

 In proprietary trading, brokerage firms trade in stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, among others, with their own fund rather than customers' money, in order to make a profit for itself. 

 Besides safeguarding the overall market-place from any manipulation by brokers, the new policy would also look to further ring-fence clients' money from any utilisation for proprietary trading by brokerage firms, officials said. 

 Revising the policy for proprietary trades is one of the key focus areas in secondary market for Sebi this year. 

 During the last fiscal, Sebi inspected more than 200 stock brokers and sub-brokers to check any possible non-compliance of norms to check money laundering and terror funding through capital markets. 

 This marked a significant jump from a total of 81 brokers and sub-brokers on whom such inspections were carried out during the previous fiscal 2011-12. 

 These inspections focussed on compliance of norms regarding anti-money laundering, settlement of accounts of clients on a timely basis, segregation of clients and proprietary funds/securities and KYC norms. 

 Sebi has been taking various steps to prevent money laundering and terror-financing through securities markets. 

 According to Sebi, rapid developments and greater integration of the financial markets, together with improvements in technology and communication channels, continue to pose serious challenges to the authorities and institutions dealing with anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). 

 Sebi has included AML/CFT risks as part of its inspection of market intermediaries such as stock brokers, depository participants and mutual funds. 

 During 2012-13, Sebi had carried out 40 special purpose inspections of stock brokers to check their compliance with the AML/CFT framework. 

 Further, 35 inspections of stock brokers and six depository participants focusing on compliance with KYC norms were carried out in 2012-13."

 Among others, Sebi will study the systems put in place by its peer regulators in countries like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong for this purpose, a senior official said. 

 The proposed move is part of various policy issues under consideration of Sebi's Integrated Surveillance Department and aims to make its systems more effective. 

 Among others, the Department is also formulating a plan of action for tackling the menace of companies existing on paper only, while stringent actions are underway against those violating the Listing Agreement by making inadequate disclosure of price sensitive information. 

 Besides, the regulator is also considering possible action like freezing of promoter shares in a company found to be non-compliant to the Listing Agreement and other norms. 

 Concerned about gullible investors being defrauded by certain companies existing only on paper, the capital markets watchdog is planning to conduct surprise inspections of such entities to bring them to book. 

 The typical modus-operandi of such entities involves setting up of a company, followed by tall claims about their proposed business ventures. Then an exercise is undertaken to collect funds from investors, including through IPOs (Initial Public Offers) of shares and issuance of other securities. 

 The study on 'trend or pattern discovery module' would also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others. 

 The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by capital markets regulator Sebi for the current financial year, for which Sebi has identified 'capacity building' as a core focus area. 

 According to the proposed move, a comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to understand the ""trend/pattern discovery by regulators in developed markets like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong"" in order to keep pace with the ever increasing globalisation of Indian markets. 

 ""The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc,"" the official added. 

 With regard to Sebi's capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously.

Sebi to tap social media for investor awareness campaigns,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-to-tap-social-media-for-investor-awareness-campaigns/articleshow/47222822.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi to tap social media for investor awareness campaigns,"NEW DELHI: Markets regulator Sebi has decided to tap social media and other popular internet and mobile platforms to make investors aware about their rights and to safeguard them against possible frauds. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is already using platforms like TV, radio and print newspapers for investor education and awareness programmes. It has carried out campaigns in 13 languages including English, Hindi and regional languages spoken across India. 

 In the current fiscal 2015-16, Sebi has now proposed to explore other mediums like outdoor media, advertising, as well as social media to spread investor education and awareness, as also the financial education, as per the regulator's budget proposals for this financial year. 

 Sebi is already present on Twitter through which it gives updates about the investor education and financial literacy workshops being held in different parts of the country, along with other information for the benefit of investors. 

 Sebi is now planning to expand the use of Twitter and other social media platforms in a big way. 

 ""Media planning for the campaign was undertaken keeping in mind the reach to the target audience. It is important that the messages are published, broadcast with greater frequency through repeated insertions in TV, Radio, print so these messages are appropriately visible to the target audience. 

 ""It is also needed that we may adopt the new popular media such as internet, mobile etc. Hence, it is pertinent that the expenditure on media services (broadcast/publication of advertisement) is also enhanced accordingly. 

 ""During Financial Year 2015-16 scale of campaigns undertaken through mass media will largely depend on the availability of sufficient funds for this purpose,"" Sebi said in its Budget proposals for the current fiscal. 

 Since December 2012, various campaigns have been carried out where advertisements were broadcast or published on TV, Radio and Print media on topics such as 'Grievance Redress Mechanism' and 'Collective Investment Scheme', covering pan India (in 13 languages) through over 40,000 TVC spots, over 88,000 Radio Spots, and 600 print editions. 

 In March this year, Sebi also launched a major SMS campaign to create awareness among the public about fraudulent schemes claiming 'big profits in less time'. 

 In the last fiscal, Sebi busted more than 150 cases of frauds against gullible investors involving close to Rs 13,000 crore. It has been noticed that fraudsters are also using SMS route to lure gullible investors with promise of returns. 

 In its SMS campaign, Sebi is specially targeting the schemes where investors are promised doubling of their investments within a few months, or guaranteed fixed returns for life after investing some thousands or lakhs of rupees. 

 Besides, Sebi is continuing its investor education and awareness programmes through newspapers. One such campaign says ""high return in less time means more trouble"" and cautions against promises of investors being made ""millionaire overnight""."
"Sebi wants young, high-earning worker pension money in MFs","{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-wants-young-high-earning-workers-pension-money-in-mfs/articleshow/30723961.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi wants young, high-earning workers' pension money in MFs","NEW DELHI: Market regulator Sebi has pitched for a part of money lying in employee pension funds to be invested in mutual fund schemes for investors aged below 40-45 years and those earning over Rs 6,500 per month. 

 While looking to give a boost to the mutual fund sector with some contribution from about Rs 5.5 lakh crore corpus being managed by EPFO (Employee Provident Fund Organisation), Sebi feels that age restrictions would safeguard investors from ""unnecessary risks"" during years closer to their retirement. 

 At the same time, income-related restrictions would also help keep the low-income employees away from the potential risks associated with capital markets, which has been a major roadblock in pension money being invested in high-risk assets. 

 Under the new long-term mutual fund policy being finalised by Sebi, the regulator will soon ask the government to pave way for a part of EPFO corpus being invested in MF schemes. The policy has been approved by the Sebi board and would soon be notified. 

 Finance Ministry had permitted EPFO way back in 2008 to invest up to 15 per cent of its corpus in shares or equity linked schemes of mutual funds. However, due to probable risk aversion on part of the trustees of EPFO, investment in equity-oriented mutual funds is not being made currently. 

 Further, Labour Ministry last year superseded an earlier decision and specifically stated that no investment is allowed in equity and equity-focussed MF schemes. 

 Sebi has now suggested change in this Labour Ministry circular to allow EPFO to invest up to 15 per cent of their corpus in equities and mutual funds. The move would help in channelising retirement money into mutual fund space. 

 It is mandatory to have employee provident fund schemes for all workers earning up to Rs 6,500 per month. Sebi, however, said that a majority of contribution in EPFO corpus comes from high-end workers for tax benefits and assured returns. 

 ""It should now be suggested that at the choice of the employee/member, contributions to such provident fund programmes can now be offered an option for a part of their corpus to be invested in a Mutual Fund product of the choice of such member/employee,"" says Sebi proposal. 

 Sebi has said that EPFO can approve specific schemes based on their track record and other parameters to be eligible for such investments, which such facilities can be restricted to the workers in a prescribed age group, which can be 25-40 years or 25-45 years. 

 Also, the amount of such allocation to MF schemes can be restricted to 20-25 per cent of worker's contribution, Sebi said, adding that a similar practice is there in the US. 

 ""Such restrictions will ensure that members of EPFO do not take unnecessary risks during their years closer to retirement,"" Sebi said. 

 The total corpus available with EPFO was about Rs 5.46 lakh crore at the end of fiscal 2011-12. The annual incremental inflows consisting of fresh inflows, maturity and interest payments accruing to fund is about Rs 80,000 crore. 

 Sebi said a potential investment of 15 per cent of EPFO corpus in equities and mutual funds would lead to substantial inflows into the markets. 

 Even if a small portion, say 5 per cent, is diverted towards equity mutual funds, it may result in new inflows of about Rs 27,300 crore from the existing corpus and Rs 4,000 crore annually from fresh contribution to EPFO, Sebi says. 

 The EPFO, whose corpus comprises contribution by the employee/member as well as his employer, has so far preferred to invest in government bonds rather than equities to avoid any potential risks to the capital. 

 Any suggestion for retirement fund of salaried employees to be invested in equities is usually met with strong opposition from trade unions and political parties. 

 Over 44 per cent of households in the US are estimated to have their savings in mutual funds, while the same figure in India stands at a mere 2.5 per cent."

 There was some upmove in the cyclicals after the new government was formed at the centre but it petered out after disappointing performance in April-June quarter.
 
 However, pharmaceuticals led from the front and the BSE Healthcare Index surged 42 per cent since last Diwali. The rally was triggered by earnings upgrade. According to analysts, M&A activities in pharmaceuticals companies are positive for sector.
 
 The rally in pharmaceutical space is likely to continue in Samvat 2071 as most market experts remain bullish on the sector.
 
 ""In relation to corporate governance, in relation to quality, in relation to cash generation, in relation to stability of the business considering that the rupee is between 60-62 per dollar, some of our favourite (pharma) companies are still trading at 18-22 times one year forward earnings,"" said Madhu Kela, Chief Investment Strategist, Reliance Capital.
 
 ""Extraordinary money was made in the pharmaceutical sector in the last five years and we have had a few big multi-baggers in the sector. One should not expect that performance to get repeated over the next five years, but pharma will be able to give close to the index return over the next two years at least,"" he added.
 
 Most experts are of the view that cyclicals, financials and pharma will be the sectors to watch out for in Samvat 2071.
 
 ""We are working on the hypothesis that India's growth, which had slowed down significantly over the last four-five years, is going to come back on stream. The sectors obviously have to be linked to that, which is the domestic growth. So, financials, good quality capital goods, engineering, that would be the obvious choices,"" said Sunil Singhania, CIO Equity, Reliance Mutual Fund.
 
 ""There are a lot of export-oriented sectors and that again comes back to the Make in India export focussed kind of a theme wherein IT will do well, chemicals are doing well, pharma will do well, and some engineering auto ancillaries will do well,"" Singhania added.
 
 In an ET Now poll, 50 per cent analysts expect cyclicals to outperform the market. 34 per cent expect interest rate sensitives to lead, 8 per cent see defensives to gain and 8 per cent are bullish on midcaps.
 
 Raamdeo Agrawal, Managing Director & Co Founder, MOFSL is of the view that auto and auto ancillary stocks are in a sweet spot.
 
 ""You are in an amazing situation, whether it is Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Telco, Mahindra or Eicher Motors. The best of the auto boom is ahead, you just see the sales which have happened on Dhanteras Day. Sale of two lakh units against one lakh last year is staggering,"" he told ET Now.
 
 ""When this kind of news flow comes, it takes a two or three quarters for the market to absorb. Now earnings expectations will be built for December and then you see on the earnings day, you will find that stock is up 13-15 per cent. From here on, we are going to see some interesting time in auto pack for next five years,"" he added."

 Earlier, the Committee did not have any member from the PMO, while there were two experts nominated by the Centre. The earlier rules also provided for appointment on the panel of ""other person, if any, not exceeding two, as the Minister of Finance may nominate"".

 The move to amend Sebi (Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairman and Members) Rules, 1992, assumes significance as the government has already begun the search for a new Chairman of Sebi to succeed the incumbent U K Sinha, whose current tenure is scheduled to end on February 17, 2016. 

 Sinha, a 1976 batch IAS officer of Bihar cadre, assumed office as the Sebi chairman on February 18, 2011 when previous UPA government was in the power. While Sinha was initially appointed with a three-year term, he was later given a two-year extension."

Sensex takes a breather; top ten stocks in focus,"{""Sensex"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-takes-a-breather-top-ten-stocks-in-focus/articleshow/30661058.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sensex takes a breather; top ten stocks in focus,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex was trading in a narrow range on Wednesday after witnessing a strong rally in the previous session, led by gains in IT, healthcare, oil & gas and capital goods stocks.


	With the post-budget rally over, the benchmarks are likely to remain rangebound and wait for elections results and global cues for further direction, say analysts.


	At 10:20 a.m.; the 30-share index was at 20,654.04, up 20.83 points or 0.10 per cent. It touched a high of 20,694.42 and a low of 20,629.56 in trade today.


	The Nifty was at 6,134, up 6.90 points or 0.11 per cent. It touched a high of 6,143.75 and a low of 6,125.75 in trade today.


	“The Nifty is expected to trend down till 6000 in the next couple of days. In this period the key support will be at 6071 and resistance will be at 6150,” said Somil Mehta, Senior Tech Analyst (Equity) at Sharekhan.


	“The Nifty is currently retracing the fall from 6355 to 5933 and is currently trading near the 20- and 40-daily moving averages, which should act as crucial resistances,” he added.


	Mehta is of the view that the short term bias for the index is negative for a target of 5930 with reversal at 6150.


	The medium-term outlook remains negative with reversal above 6360 as the index has started forming lower tops and lower bottoms on the weekly chart, he says.


	Here is a list of ten stocks which are in focus in trade today:


	Power Grid Ltd: State-owned Power Grid Corp plans to invest more than Rs 61,000 crore in the next three financial years, with a significant chunk of funds to be raised by way of bonds and debentures.

An equal joint venture of OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), and OIL on Monday signed production sharing contracts (PSC) for shallow water blocks SS-04 and SS-09 in Bangladesh.


	At 10:20 a.m.; ONGC was trading 0.07 per cent lower at Rs 276.70, while Oil India was up 0.3 per cent to Rs 450.

	Hindalco & Tata Power: An inter-ministerial panel (IMG) has recommended deallocation of 29 coal blocks of companies such as Essar Power, Hindalco, Tata Power and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, and has suggested ""no action at present"" for 30 other blocks.

Sentimental impact coal pricing is inevitable: P Phani Sekhar,"{""coal"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sentimental-impact-coal-pricing-is-inevitable-p-phani-sekhar/articleshow/19677492.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sentimental impact coal pricing is inevitable: P Phani Sekhar,"In a chat with ET Now, P Phani Sekhar, Fund Manager-PMS, Angel Broking shares his views on markets. 

 
ET Now: The coal pool pricing happening today and there is a sentiment we are seeing but more importantly on some of the power companies assuming that what is being expected or anticipated does come about how do you view the impact on these companies? 

 
P Phani Sekhar: The impact will be more pronounced on those projects which have been stuck and that is explained by the enthusiasm that you see in the ADAG pack or for that matter something like a Tata Power. For the existing projects the impact if at all can only be negative for a large number of projects which are getting coal directly from Coal India but for a project that have been stuck like Reliance Powers Krishnapatnam etc. or in Sasan then those projects has to be positive but more importantly it signals the way forward out of the deadlock that we got into. 

 It is more of a macro positive and some sentimental impact is inevitable. So from the coal price pooling you may not see any great impact immediately in the numbers but more of a sentimental aftershock I would say.
