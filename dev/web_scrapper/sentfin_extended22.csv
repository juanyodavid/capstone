The empire strikes back: Why gold will matter in 2014,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/the-empire-strikes-back-why-gold-will-matter-in-2014/articleshow/31356898.cms,m.economictimes.com,The empire strikes back: Why gold will matter in 2014,"MUMBAI: The year 2013 was a forgettable one for gold investors as they watched the precious metal sink 27% after a remarkable bull run lasting nearly a decade. When prices reached $1,200 levels some time last year, most experts predicted that the gold rally was over.

So far this year, those predictions have not turned out to be exactly right. Gold has managed to buck the trend, rising 10.4% year to date as emerging market economic weakness combined with rising geopolitical tensions revived its status as a safe haven.

Gold investor and strategist Eric Sprott, who has steadfastly refused to buy the theory of erosion of investor faith in precious metals, and has instead alluded to central bank manipulation as the reason behind the 2013 price fall (read his post at www.zerohedge.com on January 17), is today more bullish than ever about gold. “The price of gold and silver will both hit new highs in 2014,” he said in a blog post on January 9. “The price of gold goes north of $2,000, and silver will quickly go over $50. When it does, it will get a little crazy.”

Gold’s rise this year, which has not been as spectacular as its proponents think, has been aided by strong demand and geopolitical spats in the Pacific Ocean and Crimea.

Russia sent troops into Crimea over the weekend and appears to be slowly increasing its stranglehold on the strategically located peninsula. China and Japan are locked in a standoff over islands and in comments that reverberated around the world in January, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese PM, compared the face-off to UK-Germany rivalry before the world war.

These tensions could keep gold on the boil in the next few months but what is really causing concern among economists and traders is the weakness in the Chinese economy and signs of an apparent softness in the US economy. Bloomberg reported on Monday that hedge funds increased the bullish gold wagers to the highest in 14 months on worries that the US recovery may be stumbling. China, it is feared, is possibly in the midst of a sharp slowdown and the government appears to have its hands full, fighting fires on all fronts including currency and local demand. The yuan is weakening and growth is slipping.

So where does this leave India, one of the biggest gold importers? Not in a very good position from the looks of it. Finance minister P Chidambaram fought off a current account deficit crisis last year by slamming the door shut on gold imports. Those restrictions (an increase in duty to 10% and a ban on imports of gold coins) have served their purpose well and the rupee has been remarkably stable so far.


	 
Many experts have said that the time has come to remove those restrictions.

The government is playing it cautious so far, afraid that it will be swamped with imports despite the recent price increase. This government is unlikely to take a call on the issue. The new government, to be sworn in by end of May, will probably have to bite the bullet on this one. The trouble is they will be damned if they do and damned if they don’t.

Cut duties back to pre-May 2013 levels and you risk increasing demand, widen the deficit and possibly spook the rupee. They can’t afford that. Maintaining those levels beyond the next few months will serve no purpose at all except to increase smuggling and the misery of thousands of families dependent on gold for their livelihood.

Those who thought that the tyranny of gold ended with its slide last year, think again. This will be the year of gold."

Ujjivan Financial has received the licence for a small bank and is planning an IPO to raise `1,500 crore in order to meet Reserve Bank of India’s shareholding norms. 

 At present, about 90% of the company is owned by foreign investors. It has given the mandate to Axis Capital and IIFL for the IPO.

UTI AMC shortlists 3 names for Chairman and MD position,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/uti-amc-shortlists-3-names-for-chairman-and-md-position/articleshow/15396675.cms,m.economictimes.com,UTI AMC shortlists 3 names for Chairman and MD position,"NEW DELHI: UTI AMC, India's oldest asset management company with assets of around Rs 61,000 crore, could finally have a permanent boss after being headless for the last 18 months. The AMC's board has recommended to its shareholders names of three candidates for the position of chairman and managing director, two persons familiar with the development told ET. The shortlisted candidates are AIG India chief executive and country head Sunil Mehta, senior advisor at McKinsey & Co in India Leo Puri, and Punita Kumar Sinha, former senior managing director of Blackstone Group's India-focused mutual fund. 

 A final decision will be taken by the five shareholders of UTI AMC - LIC, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and T Rowe Price. The four Indian shareholders hold 18.5% each while the US-based T Rowe Price owns a 26% stake. 

 The board has also recommended the name of an internal UTI AMC executive as a fallback option if the shareholders do not agree on the three external candidates. 

 UTI Mutual Fund director Sachit Jain, who is part of the three-member search committee constituted by the board, said the board had sent the names of shortlisted candidates to the shareholders but declined to disclose their names. The UTI board chairman, PR Khanna, refused to comment and the three candidates, Puri, Mehta and Sinha, too, declined to comment. 

 Puri, the former head of McKinsey India, rejoined the consulting firm in December 2011 as senior advisor after serving a four-and-a-half-year stint as managing director of private equity major Warburg Pincus. He serves on the boards of Max India and Max Healthcare. 

 Mehta has been the country head and chief executive of AIG India and is responsible for all of its Indian businesses, including life and general insurance, financial services and investments. Prior to joining AIG, he was with Citibank for over 18 years. 

 Sinha, the daughter-in-law of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, was in-charge of Oppenheimer's India-focused fund which was subsequently taken over by Blackstone. The fund with asset under management of about $1.22 billion was sold to Aberdeen Asset Management in December 2011. 

 UTI AMC, which runs India's fifth largest mutual fund, has not had a full-fledged chairman since UK Sinha left UTI to become the head of market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India in February 2011.
 
 
  

 Sinha's departure was followed by an unseemly row between the finance ministry and T Rowe Price over the choice of his successor. While the finance ministry pushed for the appointment of Jitesh Khosla, a 1979 batch IAS officer and brother of Omita Paul, the powerful advisor of former finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, as the UTI AMC chairman, T Rowe Price insisted that a professional should be appointed. 

 Several permutations and combinations, including splitting the CMD's post into two, were discussed, but the deadlock could not be broken. A few board members also quit as UTI AMC slipped from fourth to fifth position in the mutual fund league table. Finally, earlier this year, Imtaiyazur Rahman was appointed interim CEO. 

 Once shareholders select and approve the name of the CMD, it will be ratified by the trustees of UTI."

The company is currently trading at a EV per ton of $35, which is nearly 30% lower than the average valuation of small and mid size peers. 

 Owing to higher dispatch volumes, the company has been able to report an EBIDTA margin of over 16% since the last three quarters. In the quarter ending June 2012, Mangalam Cements reported an EBIDTA per ton of Rs 765, which is in line with its mid size peers. Due to lower coal costs, cement manufacturers are likely to maintain this EBIDTA margins in the coming months. 

 The company is in the process of expanding its capacity by 1.25 million tons per annum (MTPA). With this, the total capacity of the company would reach to 3.25 MTPA by FY14. The total capex for the expansion is nearly Rs 500 crore. Due to a healthy balance sheet (Debt-to-Equity of 0.05), the company would not have any trouble in incurring the capex. In addition, with a higher capacity, the company will have better control on its input cost, which will in turn result in stable earnings."

Here's what Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst, Swastika Investmart Ltd. at recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Hindustan Unilever: BuyThe counter is coming out from a long consolidation channel on the daily chart while on the weekly chart, it has witnessed a breakout of bullish Inverse head & shoulder and retest to its neckline support at around Rs 2,462 level.

Reliance Industries: BuyThe counter is in a descending triangle formation on the longer time frame. It is also facing a trend line and 200-DMA resistance at around Rs 2,500-2,550 zone.

To continue this momentum for upside, the counter has to break out of this Rs 2,500-2,550 zone. Above this, we can expect Rs 2,700 level in the near term.

Bajaj Finserv: BuyIn Friday’s trading session, the counter formed a bearish engulfing candle formation with long channel consolidation on the daily chart.

The overall structure of the counter is remunerative as it trades above its all-important moving averages.

Who is buying defunct Kingfisher Airlines' shares on the bourses?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/who-is-buying-defunct-kingfisher-airlines-shares-on-the-bourses/articleshow/46831063.cms,m.economictimes.com,Who is buying defunct Kingfisher Airlines' shares on the bourses?,"MUMBAI: The prospects of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines making a comeback seem remote with the government cancelling its licence and lenders declaring founder Vijay Mallya a wilful defaulter. But, some on Dalal Street appear to be hoping otherwise. In the last couple of months, the market capitalisation of Kingfisher has jumped 40% to Rs 131 crore.
 
 The stock rose 4.9% to Rs 1.71 on Monday. Kingfisher shares are actively traded every Monday — the only day in the week when the stock is allowed to be transacted. Kingfisher was suspended from trading by stock exchanges for violation of listing agreement including non-disclosure of shareholding pattern or results. But exchange sources said Kingfisher Airlines shares were allowed to trade once a week as regulations provide for a six-month trading window to suspended companies.
 
In the last two weeks, about 10 lakh shares of Kingfisher Airlines have been traded on the special trading day. So, it boils down to the question: Who is buying these shares? Stock exchanges have said that no official data is available with them as the company has stopped filing its shareholding pattern since September 2014. Then, the promoter holding led by Vijay Mallya was 8.54% and domestic institutions held close to 10%.
 
 In 2010, Mallya-led promoter group held over 66% and institutions had more than 15%. Market sources said it is the socalled ‘friendly circles’ active in the stock. They have been selling a portion of their stakes in the last few weeks, while the buyers have been retail and some affluent investors. Brokers said retail investors are speculating that the company could make a comeback which has resulted in the recent activity in the stock. The high net-worth investors may be punting for some quick gains or taxation purposes, brokers added. ""It is a pump-and-dump operation,"" said a Mumbai-based broker. ""The friendly circles have large holdings in it and are rigging the share price to gain attraction of small traders. These operators then dump their shares.""
 
 So, is there any hope of Kingfisher's revival? Unlikely, said brokers. Set-up in 2003, Kingfisher Airlines never saw a single year of profit since it got listed in 2006. The stock had hit a high of Rs 280 in mid-2007 — the peak of the previous bull run. The company is among India’s top non-performing assets as it has failed to repay loans of over Rs 4,000 crore, mostly borrowed from state-owned banks. Its net losses in stood at Rs 822.42 crore for the third quarter of financial year 2014. As part of the recovery process, banks in February 2014 last year decided to sell a portion of the collateral with them, including shares of its group companies United Spirits and Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers, Mallya's Goa villa, Kingfisher House in Mumbai and the Kingfisher brand, which was valued at over Rs 4,000 crore at the time it was pledged.
 
 Brokers said investors who are still holding the shares should use the weekly window to sell as the possibility of Kingfisher Airlines starting operations is dim."

MUMBAI: It is clear from investors' behaviour in recent weeks and months that worries about a setback to the bull run are probably the last thing on their minds. 


	Since mid-January, the news for the Narendra Modi-led NDA government has been uniformly bad. The rate cut apart, there were the Delhi elections where the BJP was whipped badly. The GDP data revisions were greeted with widespread scepticism and the core sector and PMI manufacturing data have disappointed. The Budget, universally, expected to deliver big bang reforms, has ended up doing exactly the opposite: a number of small, but important measures aimed at putting together a framework, a structure in place for faster decision-making, growth and reforms.


	Corporate sector earnings growth is showing no sign of picking up. If the third quarter was bad, the fourth quarter is not expected to be much better. Investment is trickling in but there are no bigticket bets as yet thanks to weak demand and debt-laden balance sheets.


	Despite all this, investors are continuing to buy. In January, offshore funds bought Rs 17,689 crore worth of equities. In February, this figure Rs 8,793 crore. Domestic institutional investors purchased Rs 9,592 crore of shares in the two months. The index has gained 9.92% so far this year, outpacing most of its emerging market peers. In the past one year, India's market cap has grown 49.1% just lower than China's 63.9% and far bigger than South Africa's measly 9.8% growth. The less said about Russia and Brazil the better.


	Much of the growth has been about sentiment. The prospects of a BJP-led victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections fuelled a sharp rally which swept in its wake stocks of capital goods and power companies in the hope that the Modi's emphasis will be on triggering a revival in heavy investment and manufacturing. It is now clear that such investments will take a long time. But investors, especially those of the long-term variety, don't appear to be unhappy . They appear to be extremely pleased by the attention to longterm reforms and the building of a framework needed to spur investment and earnings rate growth. Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai is among the most bullish. ""We estimate a 24% CAGR in Sensex earnings in the coming two years compared with 17% estimated by the bottom-up consensus. We continue to be bullish on Indian equities with our key overweight positions being private sector banks, industrials, discretionary consumption and technology ,"" he wrote in a piece for ET a day after the Budget.


	Three key decisions of the government stand out in this regard in the Budget. First, the setting up of the bankruptcy court with its own rules and regulations, the infrastructure thrust with the increased outlays on roads and railways and the clarity on direct tax and treatment of MAT for FIIs. If you add to this, the monetary policy framework agreed with the RBI, and the formation of a committee to prepare a draft legislation for faster project implementation, it is clear that the government is moving fast towards putting in place the necessary structure needed to speed up growth. The bankruptcy court is important for clearing up the NPAs in the banking system, some of which may not be recoverable at all and for speeding up decisions on sick companies; the plugand-play projects will ease the doing business with the government promising projects that have all clearances in place.


	A hybrid public-private-partnership model, proposed for road projects by the transport minister Nitin Gadkari, could solve some of the problems for road and other infrastructure companies though issues such as debt burden will still play a part in kick-starting private sector participation. The monetary policy framework with RBI provides clarity on inflation targeting.


	 

	
	Some fund managers and experts are worried about valuation. Since much of the growth has come from PE expansion and not from earnings growth, there is understandable nervousness at rising prices. But are the fears justified? It is interesting to note that much of the gains in market cap and PE expansion have happened in large-cap and mid-cap companies with strong growth potential. For instance, the biggest gains in BSE 100 since January 2012 has been in Bharat Forge, United Spirits, HCL Tech, Kotak Mahindra, Sun Pharma, Maruti Suzuki, Shriram Transport, Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints and Tata Motors. A similar exercise from May 16, 2014, the day of the election results, also shows that the biggest PE expansions have happened in the frontline stocks. The big losers have been Reliance Communications, Jaiprakash Associates, GMR, Tata Steel, Cairn India and other commodity-oriented stocks.


	Clearly, investors are picking out winners and losers and seem to have avoided the heavy debt-laden companies who have issues of project execution and fund-raising.


	No doubt, there will come a time when the PE expansion will stop. Without earnings growth it will be silly to expect prices to keep moving up continuously. But with EBITDA margins inching up for large-cap companies and price-toearnings ratios still below the 24 year-average, the risk of a catastrophic collapse in equity share prices appear remote."
Wipro likely to sell water business; Focus more on core,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/wipro-likely-to-sell-water-business-focus-more-on-core/articleshow/8156228.cms,m.economictimes.com,Wipro likely to sell water business; Focus more on core,"BANGALORE: Soaps-to-software major Wipro is evaluating the options to sell off its water business and sharpen its focus on the existing revenue streams, at least two people familiar with the internal discussions said.
  
  Wipro entered the water business in 2008 through the acquisition of water treatment firm Aquatech and executes water treatment projects for large industrial customers, including United Breweries, PepsiCo and Coca Cola.
  
  “Investment in this business started with the sustainability theme but in the past few years the company has seen significant competition with several large, established players in this field. So, it is now focusing on other areas,” the first person said.
  
  While there is no formal proposal with the Wipro board yet, and discussions with potential buyers have not reached a final stage, the deliberations are part of the group’s strategy to streamline businesses and ensure focus on growing units.
  
  “I wouldn’t call it a wild speculation, have heard discussions on this subject several times,” said a person who has advised Wipro on M&A transactions in the past.
  
  Though IT services makes up for over 75% of Wipro’s revenues, the balance comes from several other business, including Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, eco-energy and hardware products. Spreading itself too thin and entering too many non-IT related areas may not pay off in the long run, industry watchers said.
  
  “An IT company being in these completely unrelated businesses is not very convincing,” an analyst with a Mumbai-based brokerage house said.
  
  Wipro has also restructured its IT business in the past few months after it disbanded its joint CEO model and announced a more verticalised structure that would make it swifter and more agile.
  
  In the past three years, Wipro has often articulated its ambition of becoming a “one-stop shop” in the water purification and treatment business and counts global majors like GSK Pharma and Coca-Cola among customers. The company provides complete solutions, including providing the process, designing and manufacturing plants,
  commissioning plants and if the customers want, running the plant. The company also gives solutions to reduce usage of fresh water for customers.
  
  Wipro’s water business is a part of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, a division that also delivers precision-engineered hydraulic cylinders, components and solutions and truck hydraulics components to original equipment manufacturers globally in the infrastructure and related industries. The division, headed by Pratik Kumar, contributes less than 10% to Wipro’s revenues at present.
  
  The company sees this division growing to a billion dollar in revenue in the next 3-4 years and it is placing its bets on hydraulic cylinders and manufacturing components for aviation and defence contractors. The company has identified Brazil and China as new manufacturing hubs for its hydraulics business."

  Once again intraday try to breach 5400, is that a cue that we could possibly see a much significant downside in the next few days to come?
   
  We have already seen three consecutive days of downside from 5600 down to 5400. 5400 was a fairly key level, which historically has provided quite a bit of support. Now we are at fairly low levels in the market, we have fallen about 600-700 points, so now the falls are not as sharp as before. 
  
  You are seeing these pullback rallies, so you can say right now the range for the next two or three days is 5400 to say about 5470 but slowly we are trying to go down, maybe not immediately but 5330-5350 seems like a possibility over the next few days."

 Those bonds have been priced at 210 basis points over and above the 10-year US Treasury bond yields, which would offer a final rate of 4.37 per cent, two persons associated with the deal told ET. A basis point is 0.01 per cent.
 
 ""Amid competing supply from several other Asian issuances this issuance managed to garner interest of high quality investors from US, Asia and Europe,"" said Pushkaraj Gumaste, head of client coverage, Barclays India. ""This has enabled Bharti Airtel to achieve the tightest ever price on its bond offerings.""
 
 Last year the company obtained a spread or gap of 270 bps when they had sold 10-year bonds offering 5.35 per cent.
 
 Bharti Airtel has approached investors for issuance of debt instruments in the form of dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes with 10-year maturities, the company said in a notice to the stock exchanges. It will use the bond proceeds for its capital expenditure.
 
 Three rating companies — Moody’s, S&P and Fitch — have rated the issuance with Baa3, BBB- and BBB- grades, respectively. These offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within US investors only.?
 
 ""As the company has committed to applying excess cash flows to debt reduction, this will not result in an increase in leverage,"" said Annalisa Di Chiara, vice-president and senior analyst, at Moody's. ""At the same time, this transaction will extend Bharti's debt maturity profile, which is credit positive.""
 
 Six banks are arranging the bond issuance — Deutsche Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered.
 
 The company which reported a net debt of $10.68 billion for the year ending 2014-15 has so far raised close to $4 billion through bonds in the past two years. Airtel currently hold a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.08.
 
 Airtel clocked revenue of Rs 92,039 crore growing by 7.3 per cent over the previous year for the full year ending March 31, 2015.
 
 ""We believe that its net debt for the financial year to 31 March 2016 will reduce as we expect it to use its available cash and equivalents of $2.2 billion and expected proceeds of $2 billion from the sale of African tower assets to repay part of its $10.6 billion in net debt,"" rating agency Fitch said while rating the company’s bond offering as BBB-."
Alkem Labs May Inspire Other Pharma Cos to Take IPO Path,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/alkem-labs-may-inspire-other-pharma-cos-to-take-ipo-path/articleshow/50038507.cms,m.economictimes.com,Alkem Labs May Inspire Other Pharma Cos to Take IPO Path,"Mumbai: India's IPO (initial public offering) market could see a flurry of activity this financial year with several promoters wanting to cash in on increasing investor appetite for new issues, according to investment bank Nomura Financial Advisory. 
 
 From the capital market perspective this is possibly the best year in the last three to five years.The quality of IPOs that is coming is spectacular“ said Utpal Oza, managing director and head of investment banking for Nomura Financial Advisory , which is one of the lead advisors of Alkem Laboratories, which will hit the market with an IPO next week. 

 Alkem's IPO will be watched by other players in the sector as the drug maker is listing on the bourses after almost a decade. 

 According to Oza, from the capital market perspective, this is possibly the best year in the last three to five years. “The feedback from investors for Alkem is also exciting. So from capital market perspective, we are in a great place,“ he told ET in an interview. 

 Oza is betting big on the Alkem IPO as he feels the success of this issue will inspire other pharma companies of Alkem's size to hit the market. “If you look at the top 20 domestic pharma companies, you still have lot of unlisted companies. You got Emcure where Bain Capital is the investor, we have Intas which went down the IPO path but put that on path but put that on hold, you have Macleods, Micro Labs, and Aristo Pharma. So, we are hoping this will spur a lot of entrepreneurs to think that this is the right way to go,“ Oza said. 

 According to the investment bank, the inter est in Alkem is mixed with domestic investors taking a lead. It expects a 60:40 mix of domestic and foreign investors. 

 On mergers and acquisitions, Oza said the coming year will witness domestic consolidation across sectors, unlike earlier times when promoters were not keen on selling to other Indian buyers. “I think the speed with which Indians can move, the knowledge of the environment, the ability to take a call on diligence is appreciated. And we see this not only in distressed sectors, but across domestic industries,“ Oza added. He further expects that in defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer, stock as a currency would be used as a key instrument in mergers. 

 “The eagerness of Indian companies looking at cross border deals is also growing, Oza said.“We never had it so good in last three years.“"
Alok Sinha takes over as new Airports Authority of India chief,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/alok-sinha-takes-over-as-new-airports-authority-of-india-chief/articleshow/29311356.cms,m.economictimes.com,Alok Sinha takes over as new Airports Authority of India chief,"NEW DELHI: Alok Sinha, a Joint Secretary in the Civil Aviation Ministry, today took over as the new Chairman of Airports Authority of India (AAI) replacing V P Agrawal who headed the state-run airports body for five years. 

 Sinha, who handles airport-related matters in the Ministry, has been given additional charge of the post till a new Chairman is found, official sources said. 

 Agarwal, whose term ended in December, was asked to continue in the post from January one till further orders. 

 The sources said the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) declined to allow him an extension. Agrawal, who still has one-and-a-half years of service left, had risen from the AAI ranks to become the Chairman. 

 His tenure saw the modernisation of a large number of major airports as also that of several non-metro ones, besides the joint development of India's satellite-based navigation system GAGAN, which would be operationalised by June-July. 

 Agrawal's sudden exit came at a time when the government was on a fast-track mode to privatise six airports, recently modernised by the AAI at a cost of several thousand crore rupees from the public exchequer. 

 Government had last September allowed private parties to pick up 100 per cent equity in operation and management of these airports at Chennai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Lucknow through public-private partnership. 

 Several meetings of an Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) have been taking place on a regular basis in the past few weeks to take the privatisation process forward at a break-neck speed. The IMG is understood to have suggested the creation of a Group of Ministers to take the process forward. 

 This is being apparently done to conclude the privatisation process before the Model Code of Conduct for the general elections becomes effective. 

 The privatisation move has not only been opposed by AAI employees but also by the parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture, headed by senior CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury."

 The incumbent CEO, Lalit Jalan, has been switched to group level operations as director of corporate strategy. ""He will steer future growth initiatives and efforts of the group with this new responsibility,"" the company said. Three group executives, on condition of anonymity, said that Anil Ambani wanted his Wharton classmate Jalan to focus on group-level strategy.
 
 The plan to change Jalan's profile was in the making for a while but was put on hold until the launch of the Mumbai Metro 1 project. Jalan did not respond to ET's calls or emails. Reliance Infrastructure also did not respond to ET's queries.
 
 But the sources cited earlier said that Anil Ambani wants to build a new team to lead Reliance Infrastructure as well as group company Reliance Power. They said there is also a possibility that the two companies could have a common leadership team though no final decision has been taken.
 
 The CEO's position in Reliance Power has been lying vacant for nine months after JP Chalasani, another trusted lieutenant of Ambani, quit citing a desire to pursue entrepreneurial ambitions. However, he joined Punj Lloyd as CEO after a three-month break.
 
 Before his resignation, Reliance Power had lost its chief financial officer Deepak Maheshwari and Ashwin Kumar. President of business development. Maheshwari joined Essar Energy, while Kumar is now with L&T's power arm.
 
 ""Jalan has been hand-on trying to resolve problems in projects. But R-Infra's challenges continue as big ticket development project like the second phase of Mumbai Metro is stranded and the order pipeline in the contracting business has been very weak,"" an executive from the company said.
 
 Reliance Infrastructure, which acts both as a developer as well as a contractor for projects in sectors such as roadways, metro rail, and airports, has suffered from the economic slowdown.
 
 A high-profile project, the extension of Mumbai's Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which it had bagged through a bidding process, was eventually scrapped as it could not agree on terms with the state government. It has also pulled out of the agreement with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for operating the Airport Metro Express line, while the second phase of Mumbai Metro project that it was to develop faces cancellation.
 
 Company and industry sources said that the Reliance Group will now focus only on operational projects for the time being at least until new projects start taking off. Reliance Infra's new CEO Mehta was with the Vedanta group for 14 years, of which in the last five years he was Group CEO of Vedanta Resources.
 
 Prior to taking over as the Group CEO of Vedanta, he was the CEO of Hindustan Zinc. The company is banking on his project execution and value unlocking skills to drive Reliance Infrastructure's growth.
 
 While Mehta could not be reached for comments, industry sources said that his key mandate could be to expand Reliance Infrastructure's engineering, procurement and construction business and tapping opportunities to divest projects under development."

 Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are currently allowed to invest up to Rs 129,900 crore in central government securities under the auction route. This limit will be increased by Rs 5,500 crore from January 1 next year. 

 As of December 30, limits available for investment by FPIs stood at Rs 1,858 crore. 

 ""The final bidding amount i.e new incremental debt limit of Rs 5,500 crore, along with the free limit as on January 1, 2016 within the Rs 129,900 crore limit shall be informed via separate circular,"" BSE said. 

 The auction will be conducted on BSE's ebidxchange from 1530 hours to 1730 hours, after the close of market hours on Monday, January 4, the exchange said in a circular.

 Consequently, exchange would conduct an auction for the allocation of unutilised debt limits on August 31. 

 A mock bidding session was conducted on Friday to check the system performance, BSE (formerly known as Bombay Stock Exchange) said. 

 During earlier auctions, government bonds have always been subscribed multiple times, given the huge interest among foreign investors, while the demand for corporate bonds remains less. 

 Earlier this month, National Stock Exchange (NSE) conducted an auction for government bonds worth Rs 556 crore, which attracted bids worth Rs 974 crore. 

 Foreign investors are allowed to invest up to $25 billion (Rs 1,24,432 crore) in government debt securities through auction while an investment of up to $5 billion (Rs 29,137 crore) is permitted 'on tap'.

 This target is almost 13 times the index’s close of 8,537.65 on Tuesday.
 
 Jhunjhunwala told a news channel that the Nifty has grown 10 times in the last 15 years and can jump 10-12 times in the next decade. “With the outlook for India, which is much better for the next 10 years than the growth in the past 10 years, and with increasing investor participation, don’t you think the next 10 years should not be 10 but 15 times Nifty?” the investor told the channel, declining to give a target for 2015.
 
 He said the market will be surprised by the country’s growth in the coming years with Narendra Modi at its helm.
 
 “Modi is an instrument. He is an instrument of change; he is not the change. The most remarkable thing of his first 180 days is that he has decided to do things at a measure and pace which is possible,” said Jhunjhunwala. “The pace of change which he is bringing about is the one which the country and the situation and circumstances can absorb,” he said.
 
 He said the government’s Swachh Bharat programme is the best investment this country can make. “It is five times more dividend than spending on health. So, you have to look at the completeness of the picture,” he said.
 
 Jhunjhunwala said a year later, Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan will regret not having cut rates in the policy review meeting on December 2. “This is because inflation will be 4% in India next year. We have had an unprecedented fall in oil prices,” he said. “The worst is behind us and now we are importing 7% of gross domestic product as commodities. That benefit is yet to percolate down,” he said."

Top five trading bets,"By Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com


	The Nifty opened the week with a subdued note and traded with a negative bias. The index registered an intra-week high of 6358.30 levels. 


	Since then the index witnessed selling pressure which led it to register an intra-week low of 6171.25 levels. Eventually the Nifty closed at the 6211.15 levels with a loss 102.65 points for the week ended 3 January.


	The Nifty has been trading in the crucial trading range for the past couple of days. In this week the index registered an intraday breakout from the above-mentioned range, but could not sustain at higher levels and witnessed heavy selling pressure. 


	On the weekly chart the Nifty has formed double top near the resistance trend line of the trading zone. Currently, the Nifty has taken support from the lower end of the zone. Going forward, the Nifty is likely to trade in the same trading range of 6190 -- 6320 levels.

	
	
					
	
	A close on the either side of this trading range would lead the Nifty to accelerate momentum in the direction of a breakout.


	Sustaining above 6,320 levels, the Nifty can head towards 6370/6415 levels. On the downside the Nifty has support at 6260/6230/6190/6130 followed by 6000/5960 levels.

UBS and HSBC also lowered their equity index targets recently.
 
 The US firm has reduced the Sensex target to 32,000 from 33,000 for December. UBS cut the Nifty target to 9,200 from 9,600 and HSBC reduced the Sensex target to 26,900 from 30,100 by the year-end.
 
 The US firm caveated its estimate by saying that investors should keep their faith in Indian markets, although many are turning fickle over a slowdown in earnings growth, foreign fund outflows and underperformance of benchmark indices against other markets.
 
 
The Sensex and Nifty were both marginally down on Thursday, the first ended at 27,809 points and the second at 8,421 points. The markets should pick up pace significantly next year, according to Citi, which expects Sensex to surge to 35,000 and Nifty to 10,600 by June 2016.
 The global investment firm has become more bullish on bank stocks and retained its overweight rating on sectors such as auto, cement and pharma, while moving telecom to overweight from neutral.
 
 The year has seen Indian stocks losing some of their edge. The MSCI India has gained 2% so far this year, underperforming the MSCI EM Index, which has gained 8.1% over the same period. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled Rs 10,500 crore out of Indian equities since mid-April.
 
 Citi has recommended Adani Ports, Aurobindo Pharma, Axis Bank, Bharti Infratel, Coal India, Dr Reddy’s, HCL Technologies, HDFC Bank, Mahindra and Mahindra and State Bank of India as top picks in the largecap space. Top picks in the midcap sector are Apollo Hospitals, Bharat Forge, Container Corp., Emami, Exide, Info Edge, JSW Energy, Petronet LNG, Titan and YES Bank.
 
 The firm said investor concerns about the market include the sluggish economy, expensive market valuations, foreign fund outflows and high expectations from the government being unmet. But these concerns can be addressed as growth is showing signs of revival, interest rates are heading lower, domestic flows have strengthened and there is no easing of the government’s resolve to deliver on reforms, it said.
 
 The brokerage said there may be concerns about the pace of economic changes but the government has delivered on policies that include diesel price deregulation, successfully implemented the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana to broaden financial inclusion besides launching social security schemes that provide life insurance, pension and accident cover to greater numbers than before. It also cited the move to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in railway infrastructure, defence and raise the limit on this in insurance.
 
 It also mentioned the Make in India campaign to drum up FDI, the auction-based allocation of mining leases and the attempt to improve the ease of doing business. Apart from lowering the Sensex target last week, HSBC has downgraded India to underweight from overweight.
 
 The brokerage house cited disappointing corporate earnings, the diminished scope for interest rate cuts, concerns about a poor monsoon and the stalling of economic reforms for the downgrade.

Corporation Bank to raise Rs 500 crore from Tier I bonds,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/corporation-bank-to-raise-rs-500-crore-from-tier-i-bonds/articleshow/46017752.cms,m.economictimes.com,Corporation Bank to raise Rs 500 crore from Tier I bonds,"NEW DELHI: State-owned Corporation Bank has launched an issue of Tier I bonds to raise Rs 500 crore for funding its growth plans. 

 The fund would be raised from unsecured subordinated Additional Tier I Basel III compliant non-convertible taxable bonds, a senior official of the bank said. 

 Under the Basel-III norms, AT-1 bonds come with loss absorbency features, meaning that in case of stress, banks can write off such investments or convert them into common equity if approved by the RBI. 

 The bond issue, which opened on January 20, carries a coupon rate of 9.51 per cent have a face value of Rs 10 lakh. 

 The issue would close on February 5 and bonds would be issued on February 6. 

 AT-1 bonds, which qualify as core or equity capital, are one of the means of raising capital by public sector banks that require Rs 2.40 lakh crore by March 2019 to meet global norms on capital adequacy (Basel III). 

 The bonds would be listed on the National Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the bank has bagged MSME Banking Excellence Awards. It has bagged two awards under the categories 'Best MSME Bank Award for Other Bank (Winner)' and 'Best Bank Award (Runner Up)'. 

 The award was received by S R Bansal, Chairman and Managing Director of the bank at the benign hands of Kalraj Mishra, Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Minister."

This would be in addition to such details being disclosed by listed companies through the stock exchange platforms for the benefit of investors.
 
 
Sebi has decided to tighten its corporate disclosure norms for listed companies, including by asking them to disclose board decisions within 30 minutes and details of other 'material' developments within 24 hours.
 
 
""The listed entity shall disclose on its website all events/information which is material and such information shall be hosted for a minimum period of 5 years and thereafter as per the archival policy of the listed entity, as disclosed on its website,"" Sebi said.
 
 
Under the new norms, the listed entities will also be required to regularly update information with respect to 'material' events. This would be in addition to the current requirement of making disclosures at the time of occurrence and after the cessation of the event.
 
 
""In addition to current requirement of making disclosure at the time of occurrence and after the cessation of the event, updation of disclosure on material developments shall also be made on a regular basis till such time the event/ information is resolved/closed with explanations wherever necessary,"" Sebi said.
 
 
The new disclosure requirements are aimed at checking a widespread practice among the Indian companies of selectively leaking the information, including through media and without informing the investors first, for personal gains by promoters and management by way of inflating the valuations in the stock market and before merger and acquisition deals.
 
 
To bring in these changes, which puts the disclosure requirements in India at par with many developed markets, Sebi's board had approved the norms in its meeting yesterday.
 
 
Last year in a discussion paper, Sebi had proposed periodic disclosures on the associated material developments till such time the event is closed.
 
 
Among others, Sebi board also approved amendments wherein companies would have ""to disclose all events or information with respect to subsidiaries which are material for the listed entity"".
 
 
Under the new disclosure guidelines, the listed entity will have to provide specific and adequate reply to queries of stock exchanges with respect to rumours.
 
 
""It may on its own initiative also, confirm or deny any reported information to the stock exchange(s),"" the regulator added."

The company plans to raise more than Rs 1,000-1,500 crore from the bond market to repay a portion of its high-cost loans, two senior bank executives told ET. 

 Money raised through this route will be 150 to 200 bps lower than the bank rates. ""The company has approached banks for a no-objection certificate to raise money through private placement of bonds,"" said an executive. The bank pays an annual interest of 11.5 per cent to its lenders. 

 A DIAL spokesperson said, ""The points raised are speculative in nature and as a policy we do not comment on speculative news."" While banks have lowered their base rate in recent weeks by 25 to 40 basis points, the bond market continues to be a cheaper source for borrowing. For instance, a triple-A-rated corporate can raise money at 8-8.25 per cent from the bond market, lower than State Bank of India's base rate of 9.30 per cent. 

 Even SBI MD B Sriram had said soon after the RBI announced a 50 bps rate cut last week ""the rates in the corporate bond market will be lower than whatever banks will pass on to customers. But the point is only better-rated customers can tap the bond market."" 

 DIAL, which commenced operations in 2010, is a joint venture of the GMR Group that holds a 64 per cent stake through GMR Airports, AAI (26 per cent) and Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (10 per cent). 

 Care upgraded the rating of the company from A to AA recently on the ground that it derives strength from the presence of a structured payment mechanism (SPM) ensuring collection of development fee receipts and servicing of rated debt through designated escrow accounts."

"D-St upset with AAP populist measures, sees no threat to BJP",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/dalal-street-upset-with-aaps-populist-measures-sees-no-serious-threat-to-bjp/articleshow/28450148.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Dalal Street upset with AAP's populist measures, sees no serious threat to BJP","MUMBAI: Stock market investors do not yet regard the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a serious threat to BJP's chances of assuming office for the third time despite the spectacular surge in fortunes for the debutant party following its stunning victory in the Delhi assembly elections.

Traders and brokers ET spoke to criticised AAP's economic policies but said that its insistence on clean candidates untainted by corruption would change the way politics is played out in the country. They were worried that AAP's reliance on freebies and subsidies would harm the country's finances while its anti-corruption plank could potentially slow down the pace of decision making. ""AAP has started on a wrong note, and if its surge continues, it could be a disaster for the economy and stock markets,"" said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares and Securities. ""Markets are wary of AAP. The party must give a clear road map on how and where it will fight corruption.

How is Kejriwal different from other populist governments?"" he wondered. Others were willing to give the newbie outfit a chance. ""The anti-corruption plank by AAP is positive for stock markets to the extent that it would force other political parties to choose candidates with clean record,"" said Samir Arora, fund manager, Helios Capital.

The day AAP won the trust vote, stock markets fell the most in one and a half months. Some dismissed it as profit booking after the Modi rally but others were not so sure. Shares of Reliance Infrastructure, which supplies power to Delhi, have dropped over 3% since January 1 while the Tata Power scrip has fallen 7.7%.

The fall was largely due to an audit of power discoms ordered by Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, and a 50% cut in electricity tariffs for households consuming up to 400 units of power per month in Delhi. Brokers believe that subsidies will worsen finances and create a domino effect with politicians in other states demanding similar doles.

Audit of power discoms in Delhi is likely to increase conflict between government and the private sector and lead to politicians resorting to similar measures as a way of punishing private sector companies.

""AAP's policy moves in Delhi has perplexed and puzzled investors,"" said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO (institutional equities), Ambit Capital, which caters to large foreign institutional investors.

AAP MAY NOT IMPACT BJP Helios Capital, the Singaporebased FII, said that it was not sure about the impact of AAP on the BJP's electoral fortunes. But it credits Kejriwal with raising the bar for selection of political candidates, something that augurs well for financial markets.

Rashesh Shah, Chairman, Edelweiss Financial Services, also lauded AAP's anti-corruption initiative. ""AAP has certain set of socialist policies that markets may not like. But the party has given a positive feel to the markets that it may curtail corruption. It may emerge as a force to reckon with in the next 5-10 years,"" he said Billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprise, often called India's Warren Buffett, said that Narendra Modi will be good for the economy.

Speaking to ET NOW, Jhunjhunwala said that if Modi becomes Prime Minister, it will generate ""a lot of confidence"".

Jhunjhunwala doesn't see regional parties performing ""very well"" in the 2014 elections. ""They have lost vote share in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi. I feel it will be an election where the regional parties will not perform very well. I personally do not see the non-NDA, non-UPA parties getting more 150 seats,"" he said.


	 

Another market expert Ramesh Damani said that despite the prospect of AAP eating into BJP votes in urban areas, the saffron party would still emerge as the singlelargest party in the 2014 general elections.

""Markets are certain that BJP would still emerge as the singlelargest party,"" said Damani.

""AAP's intention seems noble, but it's too early to judge the party. Also, elections are five months away and markets would watch what AAP does in Delhi.""

AAP has already sounded the Lok Sabha poll bugle, announcing that it will put up candidates for the May 2014 polls. Political experts believe that AAP will pose a threat to the BJP in many urban seats and could possibly eat into some of its votes. Shankar Sharma, chief global strategist, First Global, is bearish on the stock markets ahead of the elections.

""Any party to the 'left' or 'right' of 'centre' (Congress) will do poorly in up-coming elections. Markets are entirely positioned on the long side as of now,"" he said.

	ET Now: These are clearly dark days for markets irrespective of the global environment. It has been a one way street for Indian markets what is your sense do you think in the near term Indian markets will continue to underperform global markets?


	Pankaj Pandey: Well, it does look like that there are no triggers from the domestic market perspective. If you look at the current earnings, it is going to be quite dull and boring. 


	What we are expecting is that the top line growth would be about 4.7% compared to about 9.5% growth what we have seen in the past four quarters. 


	Even for Sensex companies excluding oil and gas and banks the top line growth is about 6.5% and bottom line growth of 5.5%. So if you take this growth and compare to above 14 multiples which we are trading. The earnings are definitely quite subdued and which is why we really do not see the markets heading anywhere over the next one year at least in terms of upside. 


	In case the growth does not pick up at least if we do not see any kind of a progressive recovery, so in that sense we are headed slightly lower or probably a much lower levels than the current levels. So in that sense the upside looks capped and probably would depend on the kind of growth which will deliver.


	In terms of triggers, probably in case the crude corrects big time then that could sort of limit the downside or in case if we are going for early elections that would provide some positiveness to the market otherwise for the next eight to 12 months really not expecting much from the markets.


	ET Now: Infy is slated to come out with its earnings on Friday do you think it could turn out to be a market moving event?


	Pankaj Pandey: Well, if you look at from the defensive side what we are expecting largely is about double digit top line and bottom line growth. From the IT if you look at we are expecting Ko1 companies to deliver about 2.6 to 3.9% US dollar revenue growth, and Infy would be about 3.9%. If you exclude the loadstone it will be about 2.6-2.7% kind of a growth. 


	 


	But what would be important is that the Infy guidance would set the tone for the next year and that is where we would look at. Within defensives IT still better. So in that sense it is good. Another positive is that if you look at last quarter the commentary was a lot on how the deal pipeline would shape up and a lot of deals have been signed so in that sense that is also one big positive. 


	So in that sense this year’s guidance would have a crucial role and that the entire IT sector is shaping up well and probably had declines or in case of any kind of crack one should look at these stocks.


	ET Now: But what if Infosys on 12th morning indicates that in the near term there are multiple challenges and they are not confident of FY14 growth, will that spook the market because bear in mind most of the IT stocks at least in one quarter at least the large ones they have appreciated by 20% plus so the majority of the market men either they own IT or they are hiding in IT?


	Pankaj Pandey: Well, you are right. If you look at from year to date the IT index itself has settled about 18% kind of returns and if you look at TCS should be about 22 times and Infy would be about 17 times so in that sense there is no easy money which one can look at. 


	But in case if the company does because of NASSCOM is guiding for about 12% to 14% kind of a growth and if Infy is sort of delivers or sets the tone closer to these range I do not see a big crack in any of the IT stocks. Going forward over the next one year the challenge is more towards safety because rather than return because I do not think we are in a situation where one should be chasing returns big time. 


	It is better to be safe. Last year if you look at TCS actually did not do anything in terms of price performance but then you had this air where it has done  substantially well. Similarly we are expecting that the price crack even in case of the growth turns out to be slightly subdued will not be much, so in that sense I am more seeking towards safety rather than returns at this point in time."

ET Now: A sharp drop has been observed by shares of Eros International Media's NYSE-listed parent after some question raised by the investment bank Wells Fargo. The NSE-listed stock duly corrected on Monday. Have valuations become attractive or would you be wary because of all the negative news flow surrounding the stock?
 
Deven Choksey: On one side, the company has extremely high potential. So, one would like to look at the company with the long-term investment point of view. On the other side, the this particular subject of parent-related issues, for which the company is having some amount of impact, needs to be studied in detail.
 
 Only thereafter one could probably analyse how much impact it could have, if at all, going forward. Till that point of time, I would like to reserve my view on this particular company.

 The Ontario-based company, a unit of the Ruias-controlled Essar Steel, had reported a net loss of $30.65 million in the same quarter last year. 

 ""The gain is attributable to higher shipments coupled with higher selling prices and lower costs,"" Essar Steel Algoma said in a statement. 

 Shipments for the quarter were 6.18 lakh tonnes, up 4.7 per cent as compared to the same period last year. Average realised sales returns improved in the quarter by 15.8 per cent. 

 The company said it had completed a comprehensive recapitalisation and refinancing during the quarter, resulting in a deleveraging of the balance sheet by more than $200 million and an approximate $47 million reduction in annual cash interest expense. 

 ""While we are seeing some near-term softening in market fundamentals we are confident our balanced product mix and low cost position provide a sound foundation for strategic reinvestment in optimisation and growth in the months and years ahead,"" Essar Steel Algoma Chief Executive Officer Kalyan Ghosh said."
ETFs based on MSCI Index set to hit the market soon,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/etfs-based-on-msci-index-set-to-hit-the-market-soon/articleshow/46634809.cms,m.economictimes.com,ETFs based on MSCI Index set to hit the market soon,"NEW DELHI: Two mutual fund houses will soon launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the MSCI India Domestic Index with an eye on tapping inflows from FIIs. Foreign fund managers use MSCI's indices globally and are comfortable with them. Reliance Mutual Fund and Edelweiss Mutual Fund have filed offer documents with Sebi for launching this product. 

 Unlike the Sensex and the Nifty, which have a fixed number of stocks (30 and 50, respectively), the number of stocks in the MSCI India Domestic Index can vary. It stands at 64 currently. The index tries to capture 85% of the total market capitalisation. This is higher than the Nifty, which includes around 70%. ""If you invest in an ETF based on the MSCI India Domestic Index, you will get wider representation of the Indian market,"" says Vikaas M Sachdeva, chief executive officer of Edelweiss Asset Management. 

 The MSCI India Domestic In dex is predominantly a large-cap index with up to 70% in large-cap stocks, another 15% in mid-caps and 15% in small-caps. Fund houses are trying to tap foreign fund managers' familiarity and high degree of comfort with MSCI indices. ""About 80% of the money coming into India is from investors who use MSCI's benchmark indices,"" says Sundeep Sikka, President and chief executive officer of Reliance Asset Management. Adds Sachdeva: ""MSCI is the global gold standard in the benchmark index business. Its indices are followed globally. So an ETF based on MSCI's India index is likely to find many takers."" 

 This ETF will also help foreign investors circumvent the cap on FII ownership in stocks. ""If FIIs take the ETF route, the cap on FII ownership in stocks will not apply since that rule does not hold for mutual fund investments,"" says Sikka. 

 ETFs are a good way to get diversified, high-quality and low-cost exposure to a market or sector. What Should You Do? In the large-cap space, which is widely tracked, it is advisable for retail investors to use ETFs. In the midand small-cap space, however, where the scope for generating alpha is higher, you may opt for actively-managed funds. 

 Examine two parameters before investing in this ETF: expense ratio and tracking error.The average expense ratio of large-cap ETFs is 57 bps currently. Reliance's product will have an expense ratio of 25-30 bps (Edelweiss yet to determine).""Besides a low-expense ratio, ensure that the ETF has a low tracking error. This data will become available only after the product has been in existence for some time,"" says Vishal Dhawan, chief financial planner of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. 

 Tracking error tells you how closely an ETF has been able to replicate the performance of its benchmark index."

Sandeep Wagle: There is a possibility of some kind of a choppiness based on the news. We cannot really make out what the market expectation is in terms of the rate cut. In that sense, I would exercise some caution. But I do not see any pattern that suggests that there can be a one-way slide. Yes, I think it is safe to keep your stop losses a little below 7,900, say, at around 7,880-7,890. If the range is broken, then that will be negative.

 “KPMG has been appointed to run a forensic audit of UCX after it was found prima facie that the latter’s promoter Commex Technology siphoned off funds belonging to the bourse’s other shareholders, to its group companies,” said Ramesh Abhishek, FMC chairman. “One of the main ToRs (terms of reference) of the audit is to trace the funds. It’s too early to say anything more,” he added when asked to elaborate.
 
 Ketan Sheth, MD, Commex Technology, was not available for comment. The findings of a forensic audit can be provided as evidence in court.
 
 Commex Technology, described as being in the business of IT consulting and software on BSE, holds 40% in UCX. The other key shareholders of the bourse include IDBI Bank (10%), REC (16%) and Nabard (16%). The bourse was set up with a paid-up equity capital of Rs 100 crore. The quantum of funds diverted by Sheth’s company from UCX is not clear. REC, Nabard and IDBI Bank will be steering efforts to recover the funds, a government functionary said.
 
 He added that the bourse, which suspended trading last month after having commenced operations a little over a year ago, was unlikely to resume operations, making it potentially the second commex to shut down after Anil Ambani group-anchored Indian Commodity Exchange closed in April this year.
 
 In a filing to the exchange on July 21, Commex Technology said, “…trading activities of Universal Commodity Exchange are suspended temporarily till such time a renewed plan is put in place.”
 
 The bourse, which offered futures trading in oil seeds, pulses and crude oil and natural gas, has been plagued by low volumes and participation ever since it commenced operations in April last year. The imposition of a commodity transaction tax on nonfarm futures in July and the negative fallout towards the commodity market from the Rs 5,600-crore NSEL scam further hit its prospects.
 
 CTT and the fallout from NSEL have affected volumes on the national level commodity bourses comprising metals and energy bourse MCX, farm futures exchange NCDEX, steered by the likes of NSE, LIC and Nabard, Kotak promoted Ace, and Ahmedabad-based plantations bourse NMCE.
 
 FTIL, the promoter of NSEL, currently has 15% in MCX, which it is in the process of selling to Kotak group after having been declared unfit to run the bourse because of the scam at its subsidiary NSEL. It has challenged the FMC ‘unfit’ order of December. MCX has an over 80% market share in the commodity futures market, followed by NCDEX (10-14%). Ace, NMCE and UCX shared the rest."

However, resignation by MCX chief executive officer and managing director Manoj Vaish following disclosure of an audit report by PricewaterhouseCoopers has rendered the exchange headless and Singhal is among the senior most officials of MCX currently.
 
 MCX did not respond to an email. Sources said MCX was yet to get any definitive response from Singhal on whether he was willing to take charge this month.
 
 Decision to ask Singhal to run the show at MCX stems from the fact that he is well versed with regulatory aspect of the exchange business. But Singhal has never handled financial matters at MCX. Vaish was appointed just a couple of months ago after a long selection process and appointment of a new CEO may take a while.
 
 PwC has indicated financial irregularities at MCX and said that its founder promoter Financial Technologies significantly influenced the daily working at the bourse. FT, which holds 26%, stake in MCX has been asked to divest its holding by FMC.
 
 The MCX board that met on May 9 had appointed a four member managing committee of officials including Nilanjan Ghosh, J B Ram, Ajay Puri and Sandeep S. to run the exchange on a daily basis.""Franklin Templeton buys record Rs 16,000-crore government securities in a day"
"Gold rules firm for ninth day on global cues, seasonal demand",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/gold-rules-firm-for-ninth-day-on-global-cues-seasonal-demand/articleshow/48527532.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Gold rules firm for ninth day on global cues, seasonal demand","NEW DELHI: The uptrend in gold continued for the ninth straight day, its longest winning spell this year, as prices rose Rs 90 to trade at over one-month high of Rs 26,310 per 10 grams in the bullion market today. 

 The yellow metal took positive cues from the global market amid pick-up in domestic demand. 

 Silver, however, met with resistance at prevailing levels and dropped Rs 450 to Rs 35,950 per kg. 

 Bullion traders said sentiment in gold remained firm after a weak manufacturing report weakened the case for the US Fed to raise interest rates next month, which pushed up gold prices here. 

 Gold also climbed as China's yuan devlauation last week bolstered its safe haven appeal, they said. 

 Globally, gold advanced 0.2 per cent to USD 1,119.88 an ounce in Singapore. 

 Besides, a pick-up in buying by jewellers to meet rising seasonal demand supported the upside, the traders added. 

 The government yesterday raised import tariff on gold to USD 363 per 10 grams and that for silver to USD 499 per kg, taking strong cues from the global market. 

 For the first fortnight of this month, the import tariff of gold and silver stood at USD 354 per 10 grams and USD 498 per kg, respectively. 

 In the national capital, gold of 99.9 per cent and 99.5 per cent purity advanced Rs 90 each to Rs 26,310 and Rs 26,160 per 10 grams, respectively. The precious metal had gained Rs 1,240 in the last eight days. 

 Sovereign, however, continued trade at the previous level of Rs 22,400 per piece of eight grams. 

 On the other hand, silver ready dropped Rs 450 to Rs 35,950 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 155 to Rs 35,745 per kg. Silver coins held steady at Rs 50,000 for purchase and Rs 51,000 for sale of 100 pieces.

 The position has been clarified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in an 'informal guidance' sought by Arch Pharmalabs, the majority shareholder of Avon Organics with a 63.6 per cent stake.
 
 While Arch Pharmalabs is an unlisted entity, Avon is listed on the BSE and a few other bourses.
 
 The Sebi has communicated its position that an open offer would not be triggered for Avon, if promoter group of Arch hike their stake while continuing to remaining in control of Arch, and consequently in control of Avon, after a proposed transaction involving issuance of convertible debentures.
 
 The promoter group of Arch collectively holds 34.27 per cent stake, which would rise to 41.49 per cent pursuant to a proposed transaction, without affecting the shareholding of Avon.
 
 Arch had told Sebi that one of its corporate promoters AMR Investments holds 7.16 per cent stake and is proposing to subscribe to Zero Coupon Fully Convertible Debentures (FCDs) of Arch for an aggregate amount of Rs 150 crore.
 
 These FCDs would be compulsorily convertible into shares within a period of six months from the date of allotment, after which the total promoter holding in Arch would rise to 41.49 per cent.
 
 Arch has, however, said this increase in promoter holding would not change the voting rights that can be exercised in respect of Avon and there will be no change in control as far as Avon is concerned. Arch would continue to hold 63.6 per cent stake in Avon.
 
 Sebi observed that the promoters of AMR are also the co- promoters of Arch, and therefore, an increase in AMR's holding in Arch would not result in change in control of Arch.
 
 An open offer is required to be made for purchase of shares held by public investors in a listed company, if the promoter or some other entity hikes their stake beyond a certain limit or by a specific margin.

Ramamurthy, 47, will move to the company’s London HQ to take on his new responsibility on July 1, five years after he was named Indian finance director in 2009. 

 PB Balaji, currently, VP, finance at Unilever Americas supply chain company, will replace him as Hindustan Unilever CFO, and also join the Indian firm’s board and management committee, HUL said in a BSE filing. A gold medalist chartered accountant, Ramamurthy joined HUL in 1989 and worked in a number of finance and commercial roles in India till December 2002 when he moved to Singapore as vice-president — finance and controller, home and personal care business group, for Unilever in Asia. 

 With Unilever's global restructuring during 2005-08, Ramamurthy's role expanded for Unilever Asia, Africa, Middle East, Turkey, Central & Eastern Europe (AACEE), until he moved back to India. 

 The number of Indian managers has been increasing steadily at Unilever over the past few years. More than 200 managers currently serve the company globally in key leadership roles.

  MUMBAI: The department-related standing committee examining the FCRA (Amendment) Bill, 2010, has met three state governments and is expected to have a fourth and probably the last meeting before it submits final report to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. “The standing committee met with three state governments, which were quite supportive of the bill,” said a person with knowledge of the events. 
  
  “The meetings were held in Jaipur , Ahmedabad and Hyderabad and there could be one more before the committee closes its report. The commodity market regulator FMC was present at one of these meetings.” The FCRA amendment bill aims to make it an autonomous body like capital markets regulator , Sebi, giving it powers to recognise or derecognise bourses and collect funds from exchanges registered with it. BC Khatua, chairman of Forward Markets Commission, declined comment while Rajeev Agarwal, secretary, department of consumer affairs, said: “I cannot discuss any issue concerning the standing committee. Their proceedings are confidential.” 
  
  In December, the Lok Sabha Speaker had asked the committee, set up in 2009, to prepare a report on the bill and submit it to the Lok Sabha secretariat within three months. However, the committee has not submitted its report so far, raising doubts among market stakeholders whether it will be able to do so during the monsoon session of the House in July-August . “There is very little chance of the report being submitted in time for the monsoon session, at which time the bill can be taken up and discussed in parliament,” said a broker. Exchange officials privately acknowledge the chances of the bill being taken up during the monsoon session are slim. 
  
  FMC regulates commodity futures trading on five national and 15 regional exchanges and reports to the Union ministry of consumer affairs . Funds are allocated to the regulator from the Consolidated Funds of India and because of staff shortage, the regulator cannot utilise these funds to the fullest. The reference of the bill to the committee surprised many since it was referred to the department-related standing committee in 2006 and the same bill with very minor changes was introduced in Parliament on December 6.

How Sensex moved in the last five RBI policy review meetings,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-sensex-moved-in-the-last-five-rbi-policy-review-meetings/articleshow/39620758.cms,m.economictimes.com,How Sensex moved in the last five RBI policy review meetings,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex did manage to rally and closed in positive terrain in the four out of five Reserve Bank of India’s policy review meetings in the past 11 months.
 
 RBI is scheduled to hold its monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, August 5, 2014, and expectations are that the central bank is unlikely to cut rates.
 
 Ahead of the review, the BSE Sensex closed 242 points or 0.95 per cent higher at 25,723.16 on Monday. It hit a low of 25,531.38 and a high of 25,754.42 in trade today.
 
 The Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to cut key policy rates (repo rate, CRR) at its August 5 monetary policy announcement, according to an ET Now poll. However, 20 per cent of the respondents polled by ET Now expect a 50 bps cut in SLR and 5 per cent expect a 25 bps cut in the SLR rate.
 
 Analysts polled by ET Now expect the rate cut cycle to begin next year. 60 per cent of respondents expect the rate cut cycle to begin from Q4 FY15.
 
 The S&P BSE Sensex rose maximum by 1.7 per cent or 358 points when RBI held its monetary policy meet back in October 2013. The central bank hiked key policy rates by 25 bps each, but maintained its CRR and SLR level at 4 per cent and 23 per cent.
 
 Repo rate, or the rate at which banks borrow funds from RBI, was hiked by 25 bps to 7.75 per cent and reverse repo rate was hiked to 6.75 per cent last year in October and then by another 25 bps earlier in January 2014.
 
 However, after a massive 1.7 per cent rally seen in the benchmark index, the index has given more or less flat returns (refer table).
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 It is important to note that the Reserve Bank of India kept its key policy rates unchanged in the past two policy meets and the markets have more or less ended flat. It will be interesting how the markets will behave on Tuesday, August 5, where expectations are that RBI will maintain 'status-quo' on key rates.
 
 BofA-ML expects status quo on RBI's next policy review. They expect the first cut in December and early 2015 in case of drought. After all, CPI inflation will dip to 5.7 per cent in November and settle at 7 per cent levels thereafter if the monsoon normalizes.
 
 Drought poses a 250 bps risk to CPI inflation in the near term. At the same time, the global investment bank continues to expect the Modi government to focus much more on supply-side measures than the RBI tightening to combat drought.

How to play Nifty options ahead of Bihar elections and win,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/how-to-play-nifty-options-ahead-of-bihar-elections-and-win/articleshow/49460276.cms,m.economictimes.com,How to play Nifty options ahead of Bihar elections and win,"MUMBAI: Traders with an appetite for risky bets can adopt a strategy involving Nifty options to make a neat profit in the run-up to the Bihar election results in the first week of November, said derivative analysts. They stand a chance of making around two times the initial investment as nervousness around the outcome of the state polls could drive up values of options.
 
 Smart traders are simultaneously buying Nifty call and put options betting that the index could move sharply either side on the basis of the election results. A victory for the NDA government in the crucial state polls will result in a big market rally and a loss in an equally large correction. But, in either scenario, they promise that their clients would gain if they did the long strangle strategy.
 
 ""Rather than taking a directional view, it's better to do a long strangle, since markets can spring unexpected surprises,"" said Rajesh Baheti, MD, Crosseas Capital. The long strangle comprises simultaneous purchase of an 8000 Nifty put and an 8500 Nifty call expiring in November. Purchasing a call is a bet that Nifty would rise and buying a put that it would correct. For purchasing the two options, the trader pays a combined Rs 148 to the options writer. By buying both options, the traders seek to benefit irrespective of the Nifty's direction, based on the exit poll results after November 5 or after results are declared on November 8.
 
 The trader will lose only if the Nifty trades between 8500 and 8000 after the polls. In such a scenario she could very nearly forfeit the price paid to the seller. Their bet is that if the NDA wins, Nifty would rally more than 4.5 per cent from Monday's close to over 8648. If it loses, they expect the index to fall over 5 per cent to less than 7852.
 
 
  
 ""That clients are readying wagers ahead of the Bihar polls is borne out by the rise in trader activity in the 8500 and even 8700 calls for November and the 8000 put for the next month,"" said Navneet Daga, senior derivatives analyst, India Infoline. Indeed, traders' outstanding positions, or open interest (OI) of the 8000 put has risen from 6.8 lakh shares last Thursday to almost 10 lakh shares on Monday, provisional NSE data shows. That of the 8500 call has risen from 8 lakh shares to 10.3 lakh shares over the same period.
 
 However, independent analysts like Aadil Sethna, who earlier headed the derivatives desk at HSBC, the buildup of activity in the 8500 and even the 8700 calls suggests a change in sentiment for the ""better"" with FIIs having infused 3616 crore in shares in the month through Friday after having sold Rs 22,875 worth of equities in the previous two months.

 HUDCO raised Rs 2,370 crore from the first tranche of tax- free bonds launched in September. Another Rs 2,153.39 crore was garnered from the second tranche in December. 

 For Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), Corporates and High Networth Individuals (HNIs) applying for bonds more than Rs 10 lakh, the bonds bear a coupon rate of 8.29 per cent per annum for 10 years, 8.73 per cent for 15 years and 8.71 per cent for 20 years. 

 For retail individual investors applying for bonds up to Rs 10 lakh, the coupon rate would be 8.54 per cent for 10 years, 8.98 per cent for 15 Years and 8.96 per cent for 20 years. 

 Hudco will utilise the funds to finance the government's housing and urban infrastructure projects, working capital requirements, augmenting the company's resource base and other operational requirements. 

 During the current fiscal, HUDCO has disbursed loan amount of Rs 5,826 crore. Loan sanctioned during the year amounted to Rs 17,168 crore. 

 The company had posted net profit of Rs 700 crore on revenue of Rs 2,923 crore during the previous financial year. It sanctioned projects worth Rs 23,000 crore and disbursed Rs 6,000 crore in last fiscal.

T Srirang, senior general manager, who is in charge of human resources function will oversee HR operations and directly report to Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank. “I am a disciplined soldier of the bank,” said Ramkumar.  	“Whichever position the captain asks me to play, I will. ICICI Foundation is essentially a HR job. All that I’d be doing is not handle operational issues. Anyway those will pass through the board where I am present.”  	“Mr Kamath was keen that only a senior person and an insider heads the foundation because of the reputational risk to the brand,” said Ramkumar. Ramkumar has been an HR professional for nearly three decades and has run the bank’s human resources department for 13 years.  	ICICI will be investing Rs 250-Rs 300 crore a year in the ICICI Foundation. Its ICICI Academy for Skills will be training thousands of professionals for the banking industry. Set up in 2005 and built on a partnership model, it focuses on vocational training for the youth. Currently, the academy is run in nine centres and ICICI Foundation plans to touch 6,000 people by 2016.  	“Given Ram's passion for this area and his significant contribution in rolling out the ICICI Academy for Skills, our key CSR initiative last year, I can think of no better person for this role,” chief executive Chanda Kochhar said in a statement.  	“He continues to be a member of the Bank's board, overseeing the operations function which is critical to the delivery of our products and services to our customers.”  	Ramkumar will succeed Subrata Mukherji who is retiring this month end from the ICICI Foundation. The former Kabaadi champion is also known as ICICI’s trade union leader because of his outspoken nature. “He is HR head and a trade unionist rolled into one,” an employee had said once.  	Ramkumar was in the news in early 2013 after he publicly called for a probe into the circumstances surrounding the suicide of Tata Steel executive Charudatta Deshpande.  	Deshpande had worked for ICICI Bank in the past and his son was subsequently offered a job at the bank. Ramkumar is also known for his ruthlessness when it comes to firing people.  	After last fiscal year review, he agreed to the firing of 1,500 employees which follows the socalled ‘Bell Curve’ philosophy to reward and fire people.  	“Every organisation should periodically renew itself and let go of people periodically. Otherwise, the organisation will decay,” Ramkumar had told ET last month "

Results - if they are up to the mark, well and good otherwise - can surprise with the stock having built up all the expectation also.

Excerpts: 

ET Now: Post Budget, we have seen a lot of chop and churn. Do you think that the markets have hit a pause button?

Gautam Trivedi: Yes, there is a bit of a pause post the Budget. But this is really a buying opportunity. The area of focus should be midcaps because the largecaps have had a great run. There are still largecaps that will do well, but the real rally that has begun is in the midcaps.

ET Now: So, sectorally, what is it that you are overweight and underweight on?

Gautam Trivedi: We are overweight on financials, cement and construction space. We are also overweight on cap goods space.

ET Now: How material is yesterday’s RBI circular on new infra lending norms. Do you think they will change the life for largecap banks in a meaningful manner?

Gautam Trivedi: We believe that is going to happen and this was long due. The fact is that there has been an ALM issue with these banks for a long time and this has had a significant impact on banks. More importantly, a lot of infrastructure companies can now avail of long duration loans. So, this is a huge positive and it is going to be positive not only for the banks but also for construction companies.

ET Now: For cyclicals, do you think they have taken a back seat or is there still a lot of interest there?

Gautam Trivedi: There is a lot of interest there. Top pick remains UltraTech Cement. The interest is significantly more in the midcap cement space. So, for example, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Cement, Sanghi Cement and even lower down is where we are seeing incremental interest coming into the cement space. We remain overweight on cement space.

ET Now: Soon, the results season will also be in full tilt for those who are expecting anything special or magical from Q1 numbers. Are they in for some disappointment?

Gautam Trivedi: Yes, we may see some disappointment in the cap goods space because this space is forward-looking where we see over the next 12 months the cap good space significantly picking up traction. The last quarter has not really been stellar for the cap goods space. So, we might see some dip there; potentially some dip in IT.

ET Now: Aside of IT, what about defensives and pharma; as well as FMCG?

Gautam Trivedi: The interest level in FMCG in general from investors is very limited at this point and the bias still remains for higher beta stocks and cement financials; but the reality is that with respect to pharma in some sense it is less sensitive to the rupee-dollar equation unlike IT.

ET Now: The Street is divided on how should one approach banks. Should one bet on private banks which are a proxy to Indian economy or should one continue to bet on PSBs?

Gautam Trivedi: It is a mix of both because the interest levels in PSUs currently is a lot higher because even after the rally the discount to private banks remains significant and at the same time you are looking at few banks like may be an HDFC or an Axis where foreign ownership is nearing its limit. The focus among the privates is on ICICI Bank. Yes Bank already has had an offering that was very successfully managed.

ET Now: Is there more accumulation happening in oil marketing companies? Of course, we carried a story few days back which came in the papers as well. Economic Times essentially talking about complete deregulation of diesel by the end of the year. Is there still more headroom for these stocks?

Gautam Trivedi: Yes, significantly there are a couple of things for oil marketing companies. There was a talk about starting to phase out, at least the LPG, and kerosene subsidy. As the subsidies keep going down incrementally, it is only positive for OMCs.

Second point is that if you look at the absolute consumption of oil in this country we are still way far down versus other emerging markets like China. For example, there the consumption per capita of oil and oil products is significantly higher than it is for India.

India adds about over 2 million passenger cars every year and over 10-11 million two-wheelers every year. The incremental demand that will come for oil and oil products from this penetration is going to be a significant factor to keep in mind. Besides, also should be noted the pure subsidy reduction that is happening.

ET Now: Do you think IDFC will be the single biggest beneficiary of the new RBI norms because IDFC is all about infra lending?

Gautam Trivedi: I would not single out IDFC; but the fact is that the move will impact all because they are increasingly getting active in the infra space. Given what the government’s ambitions are, this is going to benefit everybody. But yes, IDFC, at least for now, appears to be a large beneficiary of the move.

ET Now: Now that the two key big market-moving events for this calendar year are behind us - election and Budget - what could be the next big trigger which markets would like to latch onto?

Gautam Trivedi: Budget in some sense was not that big an event. People were waiting to see what the government would actually do because the government had been in power all of 45 days and to expect anything significant out of this Budget was grossly ambitious.

The big event really in the next seven months, which is the next Budget in 2015 ... that is really going to be a big event; but between now and then, you will have at least two more earnings seasons which the market will focus on and that really will be important to see if the election is resulting in a significant uptick in consumption, which will obviously benefit the entire economy.

ET Now: You mentioned that you are bullish on oil marketing stocks because you expect that this subsidy burden will come off significantly. How about ONGC because if subsidy burden comes off significantly, ONGC clearly will be the biggest beneficiary?

Gautam Trivedi: Every time ONGC has been coming close to getting a windfall profit, there is either an indirect taxation or something happens by which the government ends up taking some of the thunder away from ONGC. We like the stock, we have a buy on the stock and we are waiting eagerly to know what the government’s policy is going to be with respect to gas prices.


	 
ET Now: What is the call on Reliance?

Gautam Trivedi: We like Reliance, terrific company, phenomenal execution. It's the biggest cash flow among all the companies in India. Having said that, the market and investors are looking for guidance on what the production is going to be from KG-D6 and hopefully as the government said in the next three months they will solve the gas pricing issue.

So, that is something which we should be putting behind us. It has been going on forever and is clearly hurting the company’s stock price. Finalisation of the gas price hike, one; and two, the absolute production volume increasing, would be the two big triggers for Reliance to move ahead from current levels.

ET Now: What is your take on midcap IT because on a relative basis, midcap IT stocks are still cheap?

Gautam Trivedi: That has always been the case. We honestly prefer largecaps to midcap IT stocks.

ET Now: In the largecap IT space, my understanding is that as a house you are bullish on Infosys. My follow-up question is why Infosys.

Gautam Trivedi: There is a lot of hope riding on Sikka and the fact is that with Mr Murthy and son stepping down, they have given him a free hand and there are a lot of expectations from this company now.

ET Now: What are your top-three ideas from the midcap space? Where are you advising your clients to allocate disproportionate amount of money?

Gautam Trivedi: Our top pick would be Crompton Greaves. We like that a lot. Our target price on that stock is now 235.

Second top pick would be Finolex Industries; great management. The stock has already tripled in the past 24 months but we see significantly more upside.

Our third top pick is a very interesting company - Firstsource.


	 
ET Now: Anything from media that you like?

Gautam Trivedi: In the media space, Dish TV at lower levels definitely looks interesting.

ET Now: You mentioned that you like Firstsource. What is so unique about Firstsource because this is one IT company which still has a debt on its balance sheet. What is the thinking behind liking a company which has a debt on its balance sheet?

Gautam Trivedi: That is exactly why we like it because the company is on track to repay that debt. So, the question really was will this company be able to generate enough cash flow to actually start paring down its debt. They have successfully demonstrated that over the past few quarters that debt reduction is a priority and that is the reason the stock actually has been going up.

ET Now: Bharat Forge in the auto ancillary pack has been getting some things right. It's a leader from that segment. Do you like it? Is that also a part of your conviction list?

Gautam Trivedi: Bharat Forge is something which we have not focused on, but otherwise intrinsically I do not think there is any issue with the company. It is a good way to play both the export and the domestic auto story; so we like the stock.

ET Now: What is your view on autos right now? I do not think we have taken your view on that especially between four-wheelers and two-wheelers?

Gautam Trivedi: Our preference at this point, given the erraticness of Monsoon, would be on four-wheelers, that is Maruti. We believe the stock can go way beyond 3000 ... On the two-wheelers, there is obviously a concern whether rural incomes will actually rise given the Monsoon has been sketchy and may not necessarily make up for the last few weeks of shortfall ... hence, our focus will remain on four-wheelers. Also, within the auto pack we like Ashok Leyland.

ET Now: Is there going to be more focus from the commercial vehicle segment which is more linked to a reviving economy?

Gautam Trivedi: Our target price on Ashok Leyland is probably one of the highest at Rs 45; and we believe that the stock will do significantly better. Like FirstSource, Ashok Leyland is looking at significantly paring debt. Their recent QIP was very successfully received and we like that story as well.

ET Now: Any specific reason why you like Hinduja Group stocks - Ashok Leyland, IndusInd Bank?

Gautam Trivedi: You forgot to mention Gulf Oil. The group has got a significant rerating given how IndusInd Bank has done. Of course, we have seen a change in management ... You are seeing new management and a new focus in Ashok Leyland. The stock tripled after hitting the bottom. Gulf Oil is an interesting company because the group has gone ahead and split the company into two. They have some great assets.

ET Now: Housing finance companies are evergreen irrespective of when you buy. If you bought housing finance companies you have always made money. What is your take on housing finance companies?

Gautam Trivedi: I firmly agree with what you are saying because most of these companies have low NPLs because the asset is the house itself. I do not see any downside. The other names that are out there are CanFin Homes for example. It has been a great story as well. The stock has done extremely well over the last 12 to 18 months. Gruh Finance continues to remain one of the most expensive financial stocks in the country. These stocks are basically buy and hold. I do not think anybody should try and trade them.

Investors should be wary of cyclicals even if Narendra Modi wins,negative,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/the-hurdle-is-high-for-markets-even-if-modi-wins-again/articleshow/68806306.cms,m.economictimes.com,The hurdle is high for markets even if Modi wins again,"By Adam Haigh and Selcuk Gokoluk
The bar is high for Asia’s most-popular destination of 2019 for overseas money even if Prime Minister Narendra Modi wins a second term in elections starting Thursday.

A survey of 21 global funds and strategists show most expect him to return, an outcome that may be baked into asset prices. With valuations already high, the disappointment if he fails to get a majority, needs to form another coalition -- or loses the poll -- may deflate the rally that’s made India the first among markets valued at more than a $1 trillion to hit a new peak this year.

“Numbers will matter as well as the degree to which he needs others to form a majority government,” said Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging markets strategist in the Hague at NN Investment Partners, which oversees about 246 billion euros ($277 billion). A Modi victory “should be good for markets, but the markets have probably priced it in,” he said.

 
Bloomberg 
Indian stocks have had an amazing run since Modi came to power in 2014 -- the Sensex rose about four times as much as the MSCI Asia-Pacific, so the stakes are high. Shares trade at a 38 percent premium over Asia-Pacific peers as foreigners bought more than $7 billion of local shares so far this year, the most in the region.

Sentiment is also being aided by the Reserve Bank of India, which delivered the second rate cut of the year last week, and bullish views from brokerages including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Even some local money managers who have been cautious are turning bullish, though domestic institutional investors yanked cash out ahead of the polls.

Modi’s strong response to the border situation with Pakistan appears to have boosted his popularity. On top of that, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is leading in opinion polls, on Monday pledged to spend $1.44 trillion on infrastructure to boost the economy, in a bid to match its main rival’s populist promises. Election results are due on May 23.

Global funds’ optimism is not predicated on Modi victory alone as they say the underlying growth momentum and the broad political commitment to economic reforms will stay even if the opposition wrests power.

Investors say that Modi -- or whoever wins power -- must use the mandate to create jobs and fix the plumbing of the financial system. The much vaunted consumption engine is sputtering amid the aftershocks of the crisis in the shadow banking sector.

“While the government has produced reforms, I’d be looking for initiatives such as improving infrastructure and financial sector reforms,” said Claudia Calich, an emerging-market bond fund manager at M&G Ltd. in London.


Mixed BagModi’s tenure has been a mix of big reforms including the introduction of a unified tax system, insolvency and bankruptcy rules and demonetization that struck at the heart of a largely cash-based economy but temporarily disrupted economic growth.

India’s equity valuation premium over its Asian peers will shrink if voters deliver an upset victory for the opposition.

“If the results are not constructive for investors, we will require a higher rate of return from our Indian positions,” said Ghadir Cooper, who manages $11.7 billion as global head of equities at Barings. “The government remains committed to structural reforms that would underpin the excitement we have in the earnings potential. If there’s a change in administration, we’ll look to see whether we require a higher rate of return.”

Here’s a snapshot of other views from the survey:


Rob Marshall-Lee, head of Emerging and Asian Pacific equities at Newton Investment Management
This has been one of, if not the, best governments in the world in the last few years. The Modi government has put in place numerous economic reforms, which will have positive consequences over a number of years to come. It is unlikely that a new government would fully unwind them.


Kieran Curtis, fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investment
India has had a good run, so we are probably not likely to add. A loss by the BJP would require more analysis to see how much it changes the investment case, particularly since levels would likely be less attractive to sell at.
Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Group Plc in London

We might take some profits on a significant relief rally, but we are not a hedge fund and would still maintain a position if the outlook remains broadly unchanged. There are signs that the Modi government is beginning to use some of the same bad tricks as the former Congress administration. For example, putting doves on the central bank and recapitalizing airlines with state banks.


Kiran Nandra, senior product specialist, emerging markets at Pictet Asset Management
An unclear outcome might cause jitters in the market but we would treat temporary sell-offs as a buying opportunity. The long-term investment opportunity in India remains firmly in place, and we expect good-quality companies to continue to grow regardless of different election outcomes.


Eric Anderson, emerging-markets portfolio manager at Milltrust International
We are underweight India due to expensive valuations. On the positive side, the nation does have accommodative monetary conditions and a growth rate that is trending above the policy rate and inflation, all of which are positive for equities. I can certainly see us adding to our India exposure this year.

IPFs of commodity bourses not to have FMC official as trustee,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/ipfs-of-commodity-bourses-not-to-have-fmc-official-as-trustee/articleshow/46340742.cms,m.economictimes.com,IPFs of commodity bourses not to have FMC official as trustee,"NEW DELHI: With the Investor Protection Fund (IPF) of commodity bourses functioning smoothly, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has decided not to nominate its official as trustee to the IPF. 

 An IPF, registered as a trust, is created to protect the interests of clients of trading members of an exchange who may have been declared defaulters or expelled under the provisions of the bourse. 

 ""Now, over the years the IPF has been functioning smoothly. It is therefore felt that nomination of an official of FMC as a trustee in IPF is no longer required. Therefore, the Commission has decided to amend the guidelines,"" commodity markets regulator FMC said in a recent circular. 

 As per the amended guidelines, the IPF trust would consist of two eminent persons, one independent Director on the Board of the exchange and the exchange Managing Director and CEO. 

 The names of eminent persons and an independent Director will be suggested by the exchanges and approved by the regulator. 

 The FMC has made further amendment to delete the requirement of IPF Trust Deed. 

 The exchanges have been asked to take note of the amendments and accordingly make the necessary changes in rules, regulations and bye-laws of the exchange. 

 The IPF was constituted to protect investors' funds from default risk of members of the exchanges as investors play a very useful role in commodity derivative market and their interest needs to be protected, said the FMC circular. 

 Currently, there are four national and six regional level exchanges in the country.

Jignesh Shah's arrest: NSEL Investors Forum hopes to get back money,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/jignesh-shahs-arrest-nsel-investors-forum-hopes-to-get-back-money/articleshow/34791880.cms,m.economictimes.com,Jignesh Shah's arrest: NSEL Investors Forum hopes to get back money,"NEW DELHI: NSEL Investors Forum today hoped that the arrest of FTIL chief Jignesh Shah will help in early recovery of funds in the Rs 5,600-crore payment scam at the spot exchange. 

 NSEL Investors Forum represents 13,000 investors, whose money is stuck following the payment crisis at the National Spot Exchange Ltd, a subsidiary of FTIL. 

 ""Shah's arrest was long over due. His arrest will scare defaulters and force them to pay the money at the earliest,"" Forum Secretary Arun Dalmia told PTI. 

 The entire money would have been recovered if was Shah was arrested in August last year. The payment default would have been only Rs 2,000 crore had the government taken action way back in 2012, he added. 

 With Shah's arrest, the total number of arrests in the scam has gone up to seven. 

 Shah's FTIL owns NSEL, a spot commodities exchange that is under investigation by the police and regulators after it struggled to settle outstanding contracts worth Rs 5,600 crore. 

 NSEL's payment troubles began after it was ordered by the government in July last year to suspend spot trade in most of its contracts due to suspected trading violations. 

 The exchange could not settle the outstanding trades, sparking investigations by the police and regulators to find out whether the exchange had defrauded traders by not enforcing rules requiring sufficient collateral to be set aside. 

 FTIL blamed NSEL executives and the trading parties for the default. There were 24 members who defaulted payment to about 13,000 investors. 

 FTIL owns 99.9 per cent of NSEL, which has suspended all trading operations since the payment shortages.

What is the call now on JustDial?  

 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay: I agree with you. In fact last three months I have been saying that the valuation looks little too high and that is exactly what is happening. 

 In fact last week also I mentioned that probably if somebody is holding, they should quickly exit. 

 There were lots of rumours in this counter of some global tie up, that names like Google were being talked about but if that something happens, then of course it is a different story, otherwise the valuation even now at a level of around 1000 looks little rich to me and another 10-15 per cent correction will not be out of the way.

ET Now: Will SpiceJet just be a trading play or do you think this change of ownership can materially create wealth for investors over the next 6 to 12 months? 

 
Mayuresh Joshi: Clearly as a disclaimer, we do not cover the stock but if you look at the industry fundamentals,the cuts in ATF prices should aid margin expansion. The fuel purchases made by many airlines companies during the first half should come down with ATF prices cut by 11%. 

 If one looks at the macro picture, cash flow is not strong for the entire sector including SpiceJet, Jet Airways and many other airlines. Companies are operating in a negative net worth environment and the regulatory concerns in terms of costs both in terms of parking fees, parking base, the infrastructure cost will be sorted out but they will come in the next couple of years. 

 Though margin expansion is evident probably in Q3-Q4 if crude stays this way, the probable impact on a long term basis is as very well drawn out. The cash flows improvement would be based on a lot of multitude factors and macro development as well and improvement in macro factors as well. So with all these factors probably, we are still maintaining a neutral stance on the entire aviation space.

Mitesh Thacker: The front line stocks are taking a breather after they had a three-four days of good up move, and now a short term pullback is expected. 

 The first level to look on the downside would be around 7075-7080 and if that breaks then we might see some more profit book towards levels of 7000, those will be good areas to buy into the markets especially the front line leading or index heavyweight stocks.

ET Now: Do you believe that we will probably make a dash towards 5500? 

 Ashwani Gujral: I think that seems possible and now laggard groups could add to the market like banking also picking up at some point. So, a closing above 5430 is positive. The market is scaling up and what good is that it has these declines intraday from where it shows recoveries and chances are that Fed event should also go in the market's favour. Momentum should pick up from here, participation should increase beyond those two-three sectors like tech, pharma, FMCG and once the participation gets broader then the gains will look more sustainable. And we should, at some point, probably retest 5600 in the next few weeks. 

 
ET Now: What is the call on markets right now and what are your stock recommendations? 

 Ashwani Gujral: I am convinced that we will go on printing money till everybody goes bankrupt and paper money has no value. So German Court ruling was expected. It is also expected that the FED would do things that it needs to do. It is only in this country that we keep delaying things. So, chances are that FED will also come with a QE that is expected by the market. Hence, we should be looking at a pretty benign liquidity situation which will help the markets in moving higher. 

 Overall, as long as we stay above 5320-5330, broadly yesterday’s high, we should be fine because that is also the point where a downward sloping trend line support is there, a trend line which comes from about 6300 through 5600. So overall in the longer term charts, the market seems to be consolidating at lower levels and slowly moving up. 

 In terms of individual stocks, MTNL has restarted its move. So this is now a buy with a stop of about 37, target of about 45. Tata Motors DVR is a buy with a stop of about 152, target of 167 and Tech Mahindra is a buy with a stop of about 900, target of 975.

The unexpected happened in January, contrary to the consensus view, markets sold off and the Sensex declined over 3 per cent from 21,170.68 to 20,513.85. The decline was attributed to the crack in the emerging market currencies of Turkey, Argentina and South Africa.

The main reason for the pressure on these currencies was the unwinding of the US Federal Reserves’ quantitative easing program. Local factors in these countries – economical and political exacerbated the fall and once again the world focused on the weaknesses of these economies.

Going forward as well, concerns over slowdown in China, further tapering by the US Federal Reserve are few global headwinds which are likely to keep our markets on the edge in the year 2014, but nonetheless we are in much better position than other emerging markets, say analysts.

Back home, uncertainty around general elections due in May, slowdown in domestic demand and muted quarterly results are few which may cap gains.

“On the global front, China remains a big worry for investors and therefore things like metals, etc, will continue have a bit of a problem especially in terms of the finished product,” said Anand Tandon, Independent Analyst, in an interview with ET Now.

“The fact that we have just announced a new pay commission is also a cause of worry. Every time we have a pay commission which is actually implemented the prices tend to shoot, because lot of money comes into the system without necessarily activity,” he added.

I do not think we are out of the woods anytime soon, but the very near term - we are like in the middle of the calm before the storm perhaps, concludes Tandon.

However, even though foreign institutional investors or FIIs have turned net sellers in Indian markets, but the fall in the market is less severe as compared to other emerging markets.

One of the possible reasons explained by analysts is that fact that we (India) have been able straighten out our macro situations and with recent commentary by Finance Minster, P Chidambaram infused further positive sentiment.

India’s fiscal position remains weak and a cut in spending to meet the fiscal deficit estimate this year will probably hurt growth, Moody’s Investors Service said earlier in this week.

The government on Monday this week said the fiscal deficit for the current financial year will be contained at 4.6% of GDP. The fiscal deficit, which is the gap between expenditure and revenue, was 4.9% of GDP in the previous financial year.

He further added that India's current account deficit (CAD) will be contained at $45 billion this financial year, well below the record high level of 2012-13.

	 
However, some experts are of the view even though we allowed currency to collapse but we are still not out of the woods as the deficit in totality is actually much greater than some of the countries which were facing huge FII outflows largely on account of their own problems.

“India is pushing its luck, if you add up the current account deficit plus the budget deficit of India you get a number which is far more severe than Brazil, far more severe than Turkey, far more severe than Argentina and far more severe than Thailand,” says Paul Schulte, CEO & Chairman, Schulte Research in an interview with ET Now.

“The Indian government probably was smart to allow the currency to sort of collapse because that was the way to let all the pressure out of the system. India has just been letting the currency go which is probably a smart thing to do but that is going to have very profound implications this year in the way of very high inflation,” he cautioned investors.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) which were the backbone of the rally that we witnessed in the calendar year 2013 became net sellers in the year 2014. Last year, foreigners brought in $20 billion and this year FII’s have actually net sellers of odd $250 million as per recent data.

No doubt we (India) were amongst the least affected, but FII flows did turn negative in January. There were a few nervous moments as the Sensex briefly pierced its 200-day moving average of 19,986 trading below the psychologically important 20,000 mark.

More importantly, as we speak, we are still not clear whether this latest round of emerging market turmoil has subsided. There is every likelihood that markets could trend lower as international investors (read FIIs) get more jittery.

India's growth ""remains trapped in a low range"" and the country is likely to see a GDP growth of 4.9 per cent in FY14, Chidambaram said earlier in this week. He further announced that GDP growth rate in Q3 and Q4 of 2013-14 will be at least 5.2 per cent.

However, experts are of the view that even though the figures look promising but if global growth falters Indian will get affected.

Tanvee Gupta Jain, India Economist, Macquarie Securities is of the view that if the global growth were to falter in the second half, India will get affected. Right now, in our 2014 outlook on India, we expect a 5.4% growth versus 4.9%, which we saw in the last financial year.

“The main driver for growth is external demand, whereas we expect the resumption in investment to stabilise at lower levels this year,” added Gupta.

Gupta is of the view that if the global growth is not looking as optimistic as it were in the outlook six months back, then definitely the risks are skewed to the downside on my 5.4% growth estimate.

Although analysts remain optimistic for the year, realistically there are more challenges than they have earlier envisaged.

	 
Slow down in domestic demand, extension of the tight money policy, limited gains for exporter from a depreciating currency (going forward) and the dangling sword of a hung parliament are some of the factors which may weigh down on market sentiment.

“Keeping this in mind we advise investors to back off a bit. It does appear that markets will remain range bound over the next few weeks / months with the previous Sensex high of 21,483 being a strong resistance level to breach,” says Dipan Mehta, Member BSE & NSE.

“Election results and formation of a new government are a few months away and even after that, time will have to be given to the new government to bring about change,” he added.

If you want to bet, 95% who made the last 5% that can be your choice but if you see the last three to four sessions, you have moved vertically from 6650 to 7150 so whichever way you look at it, at least some sort of sideways move should start whatever election results you get before the next upside starts. It is very difficult that you have another 10% and that will surely lead to some kind of major fall. So, we have reached intermediate top and one that will take some time in terms of crossing on the upside.

Marks and Spencer Reliance India appoints Venu Nair as managing director,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/marks-and-spencer-reliance-india-appoints-venu-nair-as-managing-director/articleshow/12109114.cms,m.economictimes.com,Marks and Spencer Reliance India appoints Venu Nair as managing director,"BANGALORE: Apparel and home products retailer Marks and Spencer has appointed Venu Nair as head of its India operations, replacing CEO Martin Jones who is moving back to the parent company. 

 Nair takes charge as managing director, the London-headquartered company said. Sources said Jones was moving back for personal reasons. Nair was head of sourcing for the £9.7-billion British retailer in South Asia and director of buying operations for India. 

 M&S operates in India through Marks & Spencer Reliance India, a joint venture with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, selling clothes and home decor but not its food products. It has 24 outlets across the country. """"Unlike an expatriate, Nair would have stronger understanding of the Indian market and his being involved directly in sourcing will play to his strength,"""" said a senior executive of a rival firm. M&S has been to work towards sourcing 70% of its merchandise from India and Jones had been driving this change. 

 """"While other international companies look at India as an interesting and emerging market, M&S clearly specifies India as a market of importance,"""" said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of management consultancy Third Eyesight. 

 In recent years, the London-headquartered company has tweaked prices in India to shed its image of being a premium retailer selling imported products. It was able to do this by sharing margins of local sourcing with consumers. 

 The retailer increased local sourcing from 38% in 2010 to 50% in 2011 and almost tripled stores sizes to about 20,000 sq ft. 

 """"The true potential of the brand is coming to life in the larger stores. Lingerie as well as women's wear categories have down well. But the brand could expand faster,"""" said another executive on condition of anonymity. 

 M&S plans to increase the number of stores in India to 50 by 2013. 

 The retailer entered India in 2000 through a franchisee agreement with Planet Retail. In 2008, it demonstrated its plan to get more aggressive by stitching a 51:49 joint venture with Reliance Industries. At that time, Marks and Spencer Reliance India had outlined an initial investment of 29 million pounds. 

 The joint venture's first chief executive, Mark Ashman, too, had moved back in two years time to become M&S's regional managing director for Europe and the Middle East. Ashman later joined K Raheja Group-promoted HyperCity Retail as chief executive.

ET Now: What is your call on Century Textiles? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: Century Textiles has been in a sideways consolidation for a long time. Today, it has broken out of the 350 zone. There are chances it will move closer towards 400 and a fresh bull move has started. This is because a key trend line has been violated on the upside down trending line, which came all the way from 575. 

 So, chances are that Century Textiles is starting a bull move and this could have a pretty fancy medium term targets. 450-460 over a period of time is not unlikely.

The company’s four business verticals – chemicals, wind power, wind turbines and entertainment – are expected to grow rapidly supported by margin expansion. The company is expected to post robust earnings growth in coming quarters fuelled by past capital investments and strong cash flows.
 
 A proposed initial public offer (IPO) of its subsidiary Inox Wind should further add to its valuations. Traditionally a refrigerant gas manufacturer, GFL was forced to innovate when these ozone-depleting gases had to be phased out. As a result, the company entered manufacturing of a specialty high-value resin Poly Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (PTFE) – originally invented by Du Pont and popularised globally by its brand name ‘Teflon’ – which is produced using the refrigerant gas. 
 ""PTFE is a specialty polymer with unique properties and hence, used in a variety of industries. Western players are not expanding while Chinese manufacturers have restricted number of grades of this product, which offers a significant growth opportunity for us,"" said Vivek Jain, managing director, GFL. After setting up a 16,000 tonne per annum capacity to manufacture PTFE in 2008, the company was able to use only half of it till FY14 as it was developing different product grades and seeking customer approvals.
 
 ""For us, the product development cycle is over and customer approvals have started coming, which is resulting in higher PTFE sales,” said Jain. “By end June 2015 quarter, our PTFE capacity utilisation should reach 100%,"" he added. PTFE contributed half of the company’s Rs 1,185 crore revenue from the chemical business in FY14.
 
 The company’s subsidiary Inox Wind, which was set up in 2010 to manufacture wind mills suitable to Indian conditions, is also finding aspurt in sales and orders. Its revenue shot up 90% to .`594 crore in the half year ended September 2014, and net profit grew 3-fold to Rs 56.5 crore.
 
 The company, which executed 330 mw of projects in FY14, is carrying an order book of 1 gw of projects and is planning to launch an IPO to fund expansion. GFL’s other subsidiary Inox Renewables, which runs 213 mw windmill farms, posted 2.4 times jump in FY14 net profit at Rs 157 crore on a turnover of Rs 175 crore. The business will be an annuity earning business, with no incremental investments from GFL. GFL’s capex cycle is almost over as it recently commissioned a 40,000 tonne per annum plant to produce HCFC refrigerant gas to feed its PTFE unit.
 
 The future capex will be mostly on debottlenecking. With strong cash flows and expected revenue growth, the company can soon wipe off net debt from its balance sheet.

Mumbai HC to hear govt's case against FTIL board on Wednesday,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mumbai-hc-to-hear-govts-case-against-ftil-board-on-wednesday/articleshow/46441306.cms,m.economictimes.com,Mumbai HC to hear govt's case against FTIL board on Wednesday,"MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court (HC) has said it would on Wednesday hear the government's arguments to a motion filed by Financial Technologies (FTIL) against the ministry of corporate affairs moving the Company Law Board (CLB) to supersede its board. In the interim, the government will have to hold back submission on its petition to CLB until after the Bombay HC hears the matter on Wednesday. 

 In its petition to the CLB, the ministry has sought ad interim relief to, among others, restrain all the current directors of FTIL from acting as directors or holding any other office in the company and to restrain them from creating third party rights on any propertiesassets owned by it. Further, CLB should allow the government to appoint nominee directors in place of the existing directors on FTIL. 

 FTIL's shares ended up almost 20 per cent to Rs 214.4 on Monday.The government petition was to be heard by CLB, Delhi on Tuesday. Now, before moving the CLB, the government will place its stand for petitioning the board before the HC on Wednesday. 

 In October last year, the government passed a draft order to amalgamate scam-hit NSEL with its holding company FTIL, which the latter challenged in the HC. The HC on February 4 vacated its status quo order in respect of the draft order with the rider that the government pass a final or der within two months after hearing objections of all the affected parties ­ FTIL and its shareholders, etc. The HC also restrained the government from implementing the final order for two weeks thereafter to allow FTIL to move the court. 

 FTIL's argument in court on Monday was that before the government passed a final order under Section 396, replacing its board would render any objection by the company to the same infructuous. Its petition has challenged the government's invocation of Section 396 for merging its subsidiary, scam-hit NSEL, with itself in public interest on the ground that the holding company would be rendered without an identity and that interests of its shareholders would be hurt. 

 But the government has blamed FTIL squarely for the Rs 5,600-crore loss caused to Rs 13,000 investors who traded on its subsidiary NSEL, in which it held 99.99 per cent, and had common directors and key management personnel. 

 The ministry has cited media reports to the effect that FTIL would ""hive off its most popular automated trading software Odin into a separate business unit for selling it to prospective bidders."" 

 Moves like this, it argues, would defeat the amalgamation exercise aimed at speeding up recovery efforts to NSEL's distressed investors.

ET Now: US FDA has been closely monitoring the domestic pharma companies. Does that make you bit wary of the entire pharma sector?  

 
Dipan Mehta: Yes. The way the US FDA is going about with its inspections, we will have to be extremely stock specific within the sector and it is going to be a bit challenging. But at the end of the day, the kind of growth rates that these companies have demonstrated and the kind of opportunity which is there in the global markets, there is considerable scope for the Indian pharma industry to increase its market share overseas. 

 Keeping all this in mind, this is a sector which will always find lot of favour with investors and of course, this risk of US FDA inspections as well as inspections by other authorities does remain. 

 One has to be a bit careful about the stock selection and you could also take a more kind of holistic approach and buy a basket of pharma companies or pharma mutual fund. But there is no denying that investors require to have exposure to pharma sector stocks just on account of the kind of growth rates that this industry has been experiencing over the past two-three years and the opportunity going forward.

ET Now: What is the house call right now on the PSU banking stocks? Are you advising people to actually bottom fish or were the numbers just so terrible that you just wait out for the pain to ease and get reported before you start buying them again? 

 
Mayuresh Joshi: Clearly numbers have been dismal. You take the case of Bank of Baroda, where a lot of analysts did not expect the restructuring pipeline the way it was. Clearly the numbers have shaken up the entire PSU lot and I do not perceive probably the numbers getting better. So our take was that Q3 and Q4 will be tepid for PSU bank earnings and only the interest rate cycle cut will probably have a structural shift in terms of bank's balance sheet, specifically on the PSU side. Again a lot of the midcap PSU banks are starved of capital.
 
 So with the government probably taking some initiative in cutting down their stake, you might have some push through probably happening in terms of capital being raised by these guys but the performance has been poor but our take is probably that if one carries on staggered investments in these banks over the next two to three months or three to four months, then probably money can be made over the next couple of years but the result probably would be on the weaker side even in Q4.

Possibly, we will head much lower in the next few days to come by and a retest of 7,700 looks to be first logical target on the downside. There is a good chance that we might even go down to about 7,630. This should start some kind of short term downtrend.

 Power Exchange India Ltd (PXIL) -- promoted by National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSEIL) and National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd (NCDEX) -- has been struggling to meet the net worth requirement. 

 Following a plea from the bourse, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has given more time to ensure compliance with the minimum net worth threshold. 

 ""Taking into consideration the difficulties and the constraints experienced by PXIL in finding entities to infuse equity, we are inclined to grant one last opportunity to PXIL to comply with the minimum networth requirement of Rs 25 crore before September 30, 2015,"" the watchdog said in a recent order. 

 In its order, dated December 3, CERC has also made it clear that no further extension of time would be allowed. 

 Under power market regulations, a power exchange should have at least Rs 25 crore net worth. 

 The bourse had sought time till March 31, 2015 to increase its net worth to Rs 10 crore and one more year to make it Rs 25 crore. 

 ""PXIL has submitted that it has taken various steps to increase its net worth and as a result PFC and NCDEX have contributed towards equity of Rs 42 lakh and Rs 2 crore respectively,"" the order said. 

 The exchange also submitted that it offered equity shares to various companies and state governments like Global Energy Power Ltd, Manikaran Power Ltd, Uttarakhand Power Corporation Ltd, Himachal Pradesh government and Tata Power Trading Company Ltd and JSW Energy and ""some of the companies have declined the offer to contribute towards the equity share capital of PXIL"".

Pre-market: Nifty seen opening flat on first trading day of 2014,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/pre-market-nifty-seen-opening-flat-on-first-trading-day-of-2014/articleshow/28213680.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pre-market: Nifty seen opening flat on first trading day of 2014,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on the first trading day on 2014 in the absence of any major global cues. Tracking the muted momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial level of 6300 levels in trade on Wednesday. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 9 points higher at 6360, indicating a flat opening on the domestic market. 

 The benchmark indices ended the calendar year 2013 on a positive note as investors rushed to export oriented defensives such as technology and healthcare sectors following sharp deterioration in rupee against the US dollar. 

 The Indian benchmark, S&P BSE Sensex Index rose around 9 per cent in 2013, touching an all-time high in early December, while the Nifty rose 7 per cent in 2013. 

 For the past 3 trading sessions, Nifty is unable to surpass 6350 hence the breakout will be materialized above 6350 and fresh rally will be seen. 

 ""The initial target for Nifty is placed at 6450 which is likely in next few trading sessions. A stop loss is still maintained at 6170 levels for all long trading positions,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 ""Short term traders can initiate long position in Nifty Futures above 6400 with the stop loss of 6350 & target 6500,"" added the report. 

 The brokerage firm is of the view that in case, Nifty breaches 6170 mark, a sharp sell-off till 6020 will be seen as per chartical indication. 

 Overnight, U.S. Stocks closed out their best year in more than 15, with major indexes advancing throughout 2013 on the back of the Federal Reserve's massive stimulus program and sharp turnaround seen in the economy. 

 The S&P 500 rose 29.6 percent over the year, its best annual performance since 1997, while the Dow climbed 26.5 percent in its best year since 1995. The Nasdaq jumped 38.3 percent, its best year since 2009, Reuters reported. 

 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 72.37 points, or 0.44 percent, to end at 16,576.66. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 7.29 points, or 0.40 percent, to finish at 1,848.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 22.39 points, or 0.54 percent, to close at 4,176.59. 

 Most Asian markets are closed on account of New Year holiday.

 The finance ministry, according to a senior official, has suggested to the Department of Public Enterprises that listing clause be made mandatory under the new MoU norms for public sector units (PSUs).
 
 Out of about 160 profit-making CPSEs, only 43 are listed on the BSE. The major unlisted profit making CPSEs include RINL, ONGC Videsh, Coal India subsidiaries, Airports Authority of India and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.
 
 ""The disinvestment department has suggested to the DPE that when they sign the MoUs with PSUs, listing plans should be made mandatory,"" a senior finance ministry official told PTI.
 
 DPE comes out with guidelines for the Memorandum of Understanding every fiscal. Under the existing norms, the central PSUs have to list out their objective, commitments, performance assessment targets, financial and non financial targets to the government.
 
 MoUs are signed between PSUs and their administrative ministries/departments and is facilitated by DPE. The subsidiaries are required to sign MoUs with the parent firms.
 
 The listing, according to another official, would help to unlock the true value of a profit making PSU and give public ownership in the company.
 
 ""Listing of a PSU helps to increase corporate governance by way of timely disclosures, greater professionalism and protection of investor interest,"" said the official.
 
 Listing of PSUs would also help the government raise resources to meet disinvestment targets and bridge fiscal gap.
 
 The government, which has been missing its disinvestment targets for past five years, proposes to raise a mammoth Rs 69,500 crore from PSU stake sale in 2015-16.

Now, Nifty likely to take support at 8,000","MUMBAI: The Indian markets ended at day’s low on Tuesday following hawkish commentary from the Reserve Bank of India on interest rates and sub-normal monsoon forecast from the government. 

 The Nifty slipped below its 200-DMA and closed near day’s low at 8,236.45, down 196.95 points or 2.34 per cent from its previous close. The intensity of yesterday’s correction suggest that the pull-back rally in Indian market, which began at low of 7997 and extended upto 8,489, is over. 

 The market is expected to remain in downward bias for next couple of months. 

 ""On all basis which is daily, monthly, weekly, a fresh downtrend has started. After a one month pause, an overall correction took Nifty below 8,280. Now, first kind of support comes around 8,000-8,050. Given the force with which this started, it is fairly decent idea to go short,"" said Ashwani Gujral, Fund Manager, ashwanigujral.com. 

 ""Maybe you will see some small 10-15 point rally tomorrow but it is clear that the pullback rally that we saw from 8,000 is probably now over,"" Gujral added. 

 Rate sensitive led the decline on the index with banks and realty sectors worst hit. The Bank Nifty plunged 640 points or 3.44 per cent. 

 ""The Bank Nifty can possibly retest 17,780, its 200-day average, and possibly break below that. Some kind of thrust has started on the downside and we should see eventually some more lower levels being tested over here both on the Nifty and the Bank Nifty,"" said Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshtacker.com. 

 ""Nifty and Bank Nifty are clearly showing signs of some kind of decline which could last for next few days to come by,"" he added. 

 While the RBI cut repo rate by 25 bps on expected lines, the hawkish commentary on inflation on monsoon concerns spooked sentiment. The pain was aggravated after Science & Technologies Ministries lowered monsoon forecast to 88 per cent of average from 93 per cent in April. 

 According to the ministry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked ministries to prepare for below normal rain. The Cabinet Secretary has called for meet on rain situation. 

 A sub-normal monsoon can spike inflation and delay further rate cut. This will have negative impact on earnings. 

 According to analysts, the market will be rangebound with downward for next quarter unless some positive newsflow boosts sentiment. 

 ""I would agree that in the near short term, scope for the markets to go up from the current levels looks limited. But at the same time, the downside is well-protected,"" said Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities in an interview to ET Now. 

 He is of the view that market shall get into a dull consolidation phase till the next quarter pans out or some of the news flow changes the sentiment. 

 ""This June quarter as well as monsoon outcome in the next two-three weeks are going to be very important. If the outlook of the monsoon comes out good by 15th or 20th of June, one can expect the market to touch or may be cross 8500. Otherwise, we will be rangebound with a low of about 8150-8200 and a high of about 8450,"" he added.

Greece is today a small nation on the southern fringes of Europe but its hold on the popular imagination is immense and its contribution to growth of democracy and the ideals of modern civilisation no less significant. The cradle of European/western civilisation and the birthplace of democracy is today caught in the throes of financial and economic crisis so deep and painful that a comparison with hyperinflationary days of the Weimar Republic nearly a 100 years ago is natural.
 
 But historical analogies dont always serve a useful purpose espeically when you are dealing with situations nearly a 100 years apart and societies and governments that are complex and governed by different rules and circumstances. If our effort is to simply understand the impact this Greek crisis will have on emerging markets, especially India, then it is to a different kind of history that we must turn to. One that is more recent and not rooted in the distant past.
 
 On Monday, Indian markets fell first after the `No’ vote in Greece, recovered and ended in the green much to everybody’s surprise. Even as European markets were swooning, Indian shares were posting a smart recovery. The Nifty ended up over 8,500, the firs time since April this year. Across Asia, things were not so bright though the Shanghai Composite ended higher. Other global markets, especially in Europe were all in red.
 
 Indian markets have been performing well since mid-June against expectations of weakness and a sharp correction. Though the Nifty corrected by more than 10% from its peak, a big sell-off like we saw in the taper tantrum has not happened. Our macro performance is certainly better but the economy is certaily not firing on all cylinders. Corporate earnings will be bad for some time, the recovery is still fragile and key reforms like the goods and services tax are still stuck.
 
 So, why has India done so well? How did we buck the global trend when we were expected to do badly? To understand the answer, we need to to back two years. To the time when Indian markets were whipsawed by comments from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke about the withdrawal of bond buying. In three months of June-August 2013, the FIIs sold Rs 20,000 crore, the rupee crashed all the way to Rs 68 and the markets plunged. It looked at that time that there was no stopping the market’s free fall. India was dubbed one of the `Fragile Five’ and a massive shorting of the currency was going on.
 
 However, in less than one month things changed dramatically. The Fed did not withdraw QE immediately, Raghuram Rajan took charge as the RBI governor initiating a series of measures to calm nervous forex markets and Narendra Modi became the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. All these three developments, the last two primarily, ushered in a bull run that lasted till March 2015. It is important to understand this analogy, historical, but neverthless relevant for the current Indian markets.
 
 Global developments have a tendency to affect shares only when the domestic economy is weak and growth prospects mediocre. They have little or limited impact if the domestic economy is doing well and investors have something to look forward to. When the taper tantrum struck, India’s macro economic situation was terrible. Investors had little faith in the government or the currency. A combination of global headwinds and domestic crisis set the stage for a spectacular run on both the currency and stocks. All this changed when the economy started improving. The currency stabilised after Rajan’s measures and prospects of a change in government and Modi’s victory set the stage for a bull run.
 
 In April this year, when global conditions started becoming unfavourable, Indian markets were hit hard again. The Nifty fell 10% from its peak as as shares looked overvalued, corporate earnings were terrible and the government’s handling of the MAT issue convinced some investors that very little can change in India. Forecasts of a poor monsoon and the prospects of higher food inflation did more damage. Like in 2013, domestic factors combined with global factors pushed Indian shares off their perch. But unlike 2013, the impact has been limited. The Nifty is off from its lows and a favourable June monsoon and a belief that corporate earnings may have bottomed out is driving up markets again
 
 There is also another important factor. The apperance of domestic mutual funds and insurance funds as big buyers of Indian equities. In June alone, they bought Rs 11,000 crore worth of shares, their highest monthly purchase ever. Since January this year, local funds have bought shares worth Rs 33,000 crore even as FIIs stayed away. Their share of the free float market cap of around 2% is too small to make an impact if FIIs start sellign heavily but the interesting thing here is this. The FIIs have not been heavy sellers. Atleast not yet. In May, they sold about $70 mln the first monthly net sale since August 13 and that jumped to about $1 bln in June. But this is still small when compared with taper tantrum period when they were aggressive sellers.
 
 This is not to say that they are not important at all. They are important drivers of sentiment and matter a lot. But when important factors like local fund activity and step-up in government expenditure are taken into account, the global jitters (unless they are of a cataclysmic nature) lose their sting. The Indian market’s behaviour of the past few weeks is a good example of this.

 The central bank offered attractive yields for long-term maturities of 8-29 years. 

 While banks and primary dealers' or PDs' bought relatively shorter-term securities maturing in 2022 and 2027' long-term investors such as Life Insurance Corporation of India' heavily bought securities to be redeemed in 2030 and 2043. India’s largest insurer is estimated to have invested about Rs 5'500 crore in such debt' people familiar with the matter told ET. 

 The Employee Provident Fund Organisation' or EPFO' bought about Rs 250 crore of the longer-maturity paper maturing in 2030 and 2043. 

 In the eight-year maturity bracket' the RBI cut-off yield was at about 9.16%' 10 basis points higher than the existing secondary market yields for the same paper. Similarly' the 29-year paper offered 9.30%' 11 bps higher than in the secondary market. In some cases' bids offered were higher than expected' dealers said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. ""This auction only suggests a nearterm view and traders will take fresh calls in the next auction'"" said Ashutosh Khajuria' head' treasury' Federal Bank. ""Traders typically would look at buying bonds from auctions and then offloading them in the secondary market to get ready for the next auction."" 

 Ten-year benchmark government bond yields' which move inversely to prices' closed at 8.85%' down 11 basis points' or 1.22%' from 8.96% recorded on Wednesday. Most of the securities on auction were not very liquid in the secondary market unlike the 10-year benchmark bond.

 Fund managers and financial advisors said investors should buy long-term debt schemes, including gilt and income funds, while the risk-averse should lock money in high-yielding fixed deposits before interest rates fall further.
 
 ""Given that more cuts are expected, investors should invest in longer tenure debt funds and fixed deposits,"" said Dwijendra Srivastava, fund manager, Sundaram Mutual Fund .
 
 A cut in interest rates would boost the performance of longerduration bond funds since they are more sensitive to interest rate movements. Gilt funds benefit the most from falling rates or softening bond yields. When yields fall, bond prices rise and vice-versa.
 
 Medium- and long-term gilt funds have given an average return of 16.19% over the last one year, according to Value Research. A gilt fund with an average maturity of 15 years could give you capital appreciation of as much as 5% if interest rates fall by 50 basis points. Add to that the coupon rate of about 7-8%, the total return from such a fund is as high as 13%.
 
 Srivastava believes that a sharp fall in crude oil, copper and coal prices has toned down inflationary expectations. ""Inflation data continue to be lower than investor expectations, supported by subdued demand together and a drop in commodity prices. We expect to see another 50-bps cut during the course of 2015,"" said Rajesh Cheruvu, chief investment officer, RBS Private Banking.
 
 In a falling interest rate scenario, investing in longer tenure bank deposits helps investors.

 The Anil Ambani group’s flagship company raised Rs 6,100 crore from share sales, or qualified institutional placement, last year of which Rs 4,800 crore was from subscribers and the rest was to come from the promoters.

 SAT reduced the ban on DLF that barred it from accessing capital markets. Sebi had proposed a three-year ban on the firm for withholding information at the time of its public listing in 2007. The ban has now been reduced to six months.
 
 According to analysts, the stock is likely to bounce back supported by renewed optimism but the rally might just fizzle out at higher levels as the debt overhang still remains on the stock.
 
 In the near term, the stock may rally up to 190-200 odd levels, so the bounce back would be purely technical in nature. ""Let us understand that news that is out is of no value, which means that three-year ban is priced in, DLF getting shut out of the capital markets is priced in, any improvement over that is a positive,"" says Ashwani Gujral, Fund Manager, Ashwanigujral.com.
 
 ""DLF is trading below its 200-day moving average. It is sharply down from the intermediate highs that it hit post BJP win. So this is the time to get into DLF because if the worst happens, it is already there,"" he adds.
 
 Gujral is of the view that if anything better happens, DLF could move back towards Rs 180-190 levels, considering the fact that other realty companies have moved up and the realty index has moved up while DLF has lagged behind because of this news.
 
 Slowdown in economic growth and high interest rates in the past couple of years saw DLF's net debt rise to about Rs 20,000 crore as on December 31, 2014.
 
 The highlight of company's third quarter results was rise in debt, which is expected to grow in coming quarter on account of lower sales. DLF's interest payments are nearly equal to the sales value of the last six quarters.
 
 ""In the near term, it is crucial for the company to manage debt and improve sales. We maintain BUY, counting on sales improvement,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities report. The brokerage has a price target of Rs 210.
 
 Mehraboon Irani, Nirmal Bang Securities is of the view that traders will buy for at least a 5% appreciation further from the present level. ""From an investment angle, the stock along with the entire sector real estate and metals is meant only for the contrarians,"" he adds.
 
 Analysts are not ruling out further pressure on DLF in the near term after the initial euphoria settles down because this is not the only issue that the realty major has to deal with.
 
 ""There are number of issues that are negative for DLF, so I believe this would be one of the positive but sale of assets is going to take a long time, and I do not know whether they can come under a decent amount of valuation for those assets which will remain an overhand,"" says Gaurang Shah, VP, Geojit PNB Paribas.
 
 ""Projects are delayed, and there are live examples in front of us wherein projects have started long time back, but there is no completion in the near future and of course we believe that there are lot of investors who would be possibly holding the stock,"" he adds.
 
 Shah is of the view that any upside would be used as an opportunity for investors who would want to take an exit route. ""We believe that in terms of earnings visibility, turnaround would be anytime soon. We have a decisive sell call on DLF,"" says Shah.

The pressure has been from both domestic and global side.
 
 The rupee came under pressure after strong US data led the increased demand for dollar. The Asian currencies are all trading on bearish side. The Indonesian Rupiah hit a 7-week low, yesterday. The Chinese yuan is at a 14-month low. All these currencies are facing different fundamental issues but the general mood in Asian currencies is weak.
 
 On the other hand, there is a strong month-end dollar demand from oil & gas importers. A declining forward premium in the market indicates that exporters have been sellers too.
 
 Weak economic data like poor IIP numbers, high inflation, both WPI and CPI have turned FIIs cautious. The Indian markets are already tackling with high inflation are now also concerned about the initial forecasts of a below normal monsoon due to the El Nino impact.
 
 Even as the Indian equity markets have been making record highs, the euphoria isn’t shared by the Indian currency. Much of the FII inflows have come into the debt markets and not equity.
 
 These inflows also have shown a declining trend in the month of April. The rupee movement going forward will depend on the inflows to a large extent.
 
 Economists feel that RBI at current levels is stretched and may not come out with many more measures. The rupee has seen some pressure on reports that RBI bought dollars to increase forex reserves as well.
 
 The country is in middle of elections and while the equity markets have factored in a stable government, any unexpected verdict can lead to a considerable damage to investor confidence.
 
 Most bankers say, the rupee will continue to move within the 60-62 mark, with 58 as an immediate upside. Decline is not ruled out if the elections come out with an unstable government.
 
 This is going to be yet another truncated week as Mumbai votes today. Banks, equity and commodity markets are shut. While there are many short term factors to watch, in the long term it would be the elections result and the agenda from the new government that would decide the fate of reforms and Rupee.
 
 While there are some tremors felt from the weak Asian data and Ukraine concerns, the effect of tapering of US Fed stimulus on flows will be keenly monitored.

A decade ago, Sebi had barred Samir Arora — the former fund manager of Alliance Capital Management — from the securities market for five years, but within months, the order was set aside by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), a quasi-judicial body that settles disputes in capital market transactions. In 2004, Sebi moved the SC challenging the SAT decision.
 
 On April 2, the apex court, in its final order, set aside Sebi's appeal on the grounds that Arora has not been trading during the period he was banned from participating in the Indian stock market. Senior counsel C A Sundaram who appeared for Arora told the court that for all these years, the order passed by Sebi was not given effect to and Arora now operates his business from Singapore and, in these circumstance, there is nothing that deserves to be decided on merits in the appeal.
 
 ""Having regard to the fact that the respondent (Samir Arora) has, in fact, not traded in the Indian market for the period August 2003 to July 2005, we are satisfied that at this distance of time, there is no justifiable reason to interfere with the impugned order,"" said a division bench comprising Justices RM Lodha and Shiva Kriti Singh.
 
 The ruling has come as a blow to Sebi's enforcement of insider trading rules, especially when new regulations are being framed. ""We have lost an opportunity to have a legal benchmark as judgment does not address the question of law........ the ruling throws no light on whether Arora was or wasn't involved in insider trading. It was one of the most important cases Sebi was pursuing,"" said a Sebi official.
 
 According to J N Gupta, former executive director at Sebi and founder of SES, a proxy advisory firm, it would have been better in the interest of market, investors and regulator if the Supreme Court had also considered points of law, which would have enabled all constituents to get the apex court's point of view for future reference.
 
 ""By leaving the points of law open, none of the stakeholders have become wiser and the regulators' struggle for enforcement of law continues,"" said Gupta.
 
 Although rules prohibiting insider trading was among the first to be issued after Sebi was set up as an independent regulator under an act of Parliament in 1992, the regulator has had only limited success in its attempt to crack down on offenders. Insider trading accounted for 7% of the total number of 155 cases investigated by Sebi in 2012-2013, according to Sebi data.
 
 ""It is ironic that despite insider trading regulations being one of the first ones to be brought into force, not a single constitutional court ruling has yet been given.
 
 Successful enforcement cannot be brought about until the judicial system fosters rendering definitive findings within a reasonable time frame,"" said Amit Agrawal, advocate, Supreme Court.
 
 On August 9, 2003, when Sebi first passed its interim order debarring Samir Arora from the securities market, it was confident of getting conviction.
 
 Legal experts said proving insider trading charges are very difficult because of the evidentiary requirements in such cases. ""In insider trading, you must have crystal clear facts. You cannot base your case on possibilities. Sebi must have a case on facts or strong evidence before it moves the higher court,"" said a former senior Sebi official.
 
 Unlike in many countries, no insider trader in India has faced criminal prosecution, which may have emboldened offenders. In 2004, Sebi, in its final order, charged the former Asia-Pacific head of Alliance Capital Mutual Fund for indulging in unfair trade practices after he was found to have sold shares that impacted Alliance's valuation at a time the fund house was an acquisition target. The regulator noted that when the USbased fund decided to sell its Indian interests, Arora was one of the contenders.

 Interview of CMDs of nine public sector banks were held last Friday here to select a replacement of Chakrabarty, sources said, adding that Mundra is the front runner among the bankers. 

 The panel called those chief who have been heading a bank for more than one year, sources said.The vacancy would arise as Chakrabarty requested to be relieved on April 25, slightly earlier than his scheduled term end on June 30. The Reserve Bank has four Deputy Governors -- two from within the organisation, one economist and one banker.Mundra has been heading Bank of Baroda since January last year. 

 The search panel has now recommended the name to the government for approval. Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by the Prime Minister, will take a final view on the recommendation, the official said. 

 The others who have thrown their hats into the ring for the RBI Deputy Governor's post are the CMDs of Punjab National Bank (K R Kamath), UCO Bank (Arun Kaul), Bank of India (V R Iyer), Oriental Bank of Commerce (S C Bansal), Indian Bank (T M Bhasin), Dena Bank (Ashwani Kumar), Indian Overseas Bank (M Narendra) and Canara Bank (R K Dubey). 

 An RBI deputy governor can be appointed for five years or till the age of 62, whichever is earlier. To be eligible for the post, a candidate needs to be less than 60 years old. After Chakrabarty's exit there will be two vacancies for Deputy Governors in RBI. Government is yet to find a replacement for Anand Sinha who retired in January.

Sebi asks bourses to move 36 companies to normal trading category,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-asks-bourses-to-move-36-companies-to-normal-trading-category/articleshow/16238268.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi asks bourses to move 36 companies to normal trading category,"MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi today said the stock exchanges may consider shifting securities from 36 companies from restricted trade category to normal trading.
 
 In addition, Sebi also advised the stock exchanges to report to it about the action taken in this regard in the Monthly/Quarterly Development Report.
 
 The Securities and Exchanges Board of India (Sebi) said the stock exchanges may consider to shift the scrips of these (36) companies from the Trade for Trade Settlement (TFTS) to a normal Rolling Settlement as these firms have established connectivity with both depositories - NSDL and CDSL.
 
 In 'trade-to-trade' segment, no speculative trading is allowed and delivery of shares and payment of the consideration amount are mandatory.
 
 The scrips which could now be shifted to rolling settlement include Pyramid Trading And Finance, Fortune International, Shree Ganesh Elastoplast and Advance Petrochemicals.
 
 However, the bourses have to check whether 50 per cent of non-promoter holdings are in demat or electronic form, Sebi said.
 
 ""The stock exchanges may consider shifting the trading in these securities to normal Rolling Settlement subject to the following: at least 50 per cent of other than promoter holdings are in dematerialised mode before shifting the trading in the securities of the company from TFTS to normal Rolling Settlement,"" Sebi said.
 
 For this purpose, the listed companies require to obtain a certificate from its Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) and submit the same to the stock exchange, the regulator said.
 
 In case, an issuer company does not have a separate RTA, it may obtain a certificate in this regard from a practicing company Secretary/Chartered Accountant and submit the same to the stock exchange, it added.
 
 ""There are no other grounds/reasons for continuation of the trading in TFTS,"" Sebi said.

Sebi eases rules for market making in illiquid equity cash segment,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-eases-rules-for-market-making-in-illiquid-equity-cash-segment/articleshow/34127881.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi eases rules for market making in illiquid equity cash segment,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Wednesday eased rules for market making in illiquid equity cash segment. The move is aimed at encouraging stock exchanges to offer this scheme for the cash segment, which will help retail investors gain exit from illiquid stocks. 

 Under the scheme, market makers are given incentives for a specified period of time to bring in liquidity and generate investor interest in securities that have limited trading activity. Market makers are brokers who take the risk of holding shares with themselves to facilitate trading. 

 Retail investors are finding it difficult to exit many stocks due to extremely low or even nil trading volume on a daily basis. The Sebi has now extended the period for market making in a stock or index from six months currently to three years. 

 Globally, the practice is to make liquidity enhancement scheme (LES) mandatory for any new products. In India, such a scheme was first allowed only in 2011. There are more than 2,000 illiquid stocks on the leading exchanges and a majority of the trading volumes is concentrated in index options segment in equity derivatives. 

 The Sebi had introduced call auction method to generate volumes, but that has been criticised by brokers as it drives away players due to many operational flaws in the scheme. 

 Sebi has said stock exchanges may be allowed to use 25% of their net profit to pay market makers. Earlier, 25% of net worth of stock exchange could be paid to market makers. 

 Stock exchanges will have to get the structure of their schemes approved by their respective boards, Sebi said. 

 The Sebi had mandated earlier that liquidity enhancement scheme “may be continued till such time as the security achieves mean impact cost of less than 2% for an order size of Rs 1 lakh on the stock exchange during the last 60 trading days”.

Sebi meet from January 27 to discuss risks of algorithmic trading,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-meet-from-january-27-to-discuss-risks-of-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/29212461.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi meet from January 27 to discuss risks of algorithmic trading,"MUMBAI: To address the challenges posed by algorithmic or high frequency trading, market regulator Sebi will organise a two-day conference starting January 27.
 
 Algorithmic trading or 'algo' in market parlance refers to orders generated at a super-fast speed by use of advanced mathematical models that involve automated execution of trade, and it is mostly used by large institutional investors.
 
 The high frequency trading exposes the market to possible systemic risks.
 
 The rise of High frequency trading (HFT), a type of algo trading, has raised concerns with regard to its impact on market quality, financial stability and regulatory framework.
 
 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is organising its first 'international research conference' from January 27-28 here.
 
 The theme of the conference is ""HFT, Algo Trading and Co-location,"" according to a statement.
 
 During the two-day conference, participants will also discuss issues related to information asymmetry, retail investors, HFT in developing countries and technology as an enabler to re-level the field.
 
 Academicians, market practitioners, regulators from countries such as the US, Spain, Australia, Canada and Japan, among others, would participate at the event.
 
 ""There is a divide in pool of thoughts over positive impact of HFT and associated risks. Because of its relative novelty and the uncertainty related to many of the trading strategies being used today, the debate over high frequency trading is of contemporary relevance,"" Sebi said.
 
 ""As both old and new emerging markets continue to become highly digitised, algo trading strategies will constantly advance,"" it added.
 
 Sebi first issued guidelines on algo trading in March 2012, after it witnessed a growing trend of usage of advanced technology for trading in financial instruments. Later in 2013, the regulator tightened the norms related to algo trading.

SEBI planning to provide fresh avenues for startups through crowd-funding norms,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-planning-to-provide-fresh-avenues-for-startups-through-crowd-funding-norms/articleshow/36731712.cms,m.economictimes.com,SEBI planning to provide fresh avenues for startups through crowd-funding norms,"MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is planning to provide fresh avenues for start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to raise early-stage funding through Internet-based platforms. The regulator on Tuesday proposed new guidelines for crowdfunding in an attempt to provide a more efficient and cost-effective fund-raising platform than public issue or private placement offering.
 
 Crowd-funding is solicitation of funds from multiple investors through an online platform or social networking site for a specific project, business venture or social cause. It can be classified into four categories, including donation crowd-funding, reward crowd-funding, peer-to-peer lending and equity crowd-funding.
 
 Apart from equity-based crowdfunding, other forms of crowd-funding will not come under Sebi’s purview as they do not generally involve issuance of securities for financial returns. Under the security-based crowd-funding, Sebi is exploring three routes such as equity, debt and fund-based crowd-funding.
 
 In most of the cases, funding is sought online on the basis of future projections rather than a viable business model in operation which increases risk of failures and therefore, loss to investors, Sebi said.
 
 Sebi has proposed to allow only accredited investors to participate in crowd-funding. It has defined accredited investors as qualified institutional buyers, companies with a minimum net worth of Rs 20 crore, HNIs with a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore or more and eligible retail investors. “Crowd-funding may provide the much-needed alternative source of financing for start-ups, but the devil lies in details and the effective implementation of Sebi proposal would be critical,” said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal.

 Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed participation of industry bodies, stock exchanges and depositories in the market regulator's programmes on investor education and awareness. 

 In December last year, Sebi began a campaign on 'Investor Grievance Redressal Mechanism', through mass media. 

 As per sources, Sebi has proposed to carry forward the campaign through media in next financial year 2014-15 under which it would inform investors about grievance redressal mechanism, Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) as well as promote securities through mutual funds and primary secondary markets. 

 It is also planning to explore campaigns through other modes such as mobile Internet, they added. 

 According to Sebi, investor education campaigns would help in developing wide and deep markets besides increasing investors' base. 

 Also, Sebi plan includes covering suitable mix of media vehicles to reach maximum investors across the country in 13 major languages.

If this continues, chances are sooner or later the averages will catch up and the market will start trending higher. So far, you have to back that. The good news is that Nifty Junior is now beginning to outperform. So, the broader market is participating. It is not just triggered by short coverings.

  NEW DELHI: Spice Mobility aims to raise Rs 300 crore by selling 32 million treasury shares, a top official with the company said on Tuesday. 
  
  The BK Modi-promoted group had earlier announced that it would be merging Spice Televentures, an unlisted telecom unit into Spice Mobiles, its handsets division. 
  
  “Spice Mobile is undertaking the process of reverse merger with Spice Televentures to form Spice Mobility and this will lead to 42 million treasury shares of which 10 million will be kept for employees and the rest sold,” chairman BK Modi said in Delhi. 
  
  Mr Modi said that the reverse merger will result in a cash flow of Rs 300 crore through sale of treasury shares which would be used to fund both the expansion of its mobile retail outlets and acquire smaller firms in the value added services (VAS) space. 
  
  Edelweiss is advising the Group on the merger and consolidation plan. 
  
  “We expect all the clearances to come in by September and by October the (treasury) shares should be available in the market, Mr Modi said, adding: ”Post integration, we will focus on handsets, VAS and retail chains. So any acquisition that is of the right valuation , we would look at it.” 
  
  He also said that it would not be possible to put a number to the retail outlets the group planed to set up. It currently operates about 750 retail outlets. ‘Our focus will be the metros and big cities such as Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Hyderabad,” Mr Modi added. 
  
  The Spice Group also runs another value added services firm called Spice i2i in Singapore. 
  
  “Our firm, Spice i2i, listed on the Singapore Exchange and we are in the process of raising $133 million through a rights issue. As a group, we are cashrich and with more funds coming in, we are adequately equipped for our growth plans,” Mr Modi said.

State-owned banks may have to shell out more on perpetual bonds,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/state-owned-banks-may-have-to-shell-out-more-on-perpetual-bonds/articleshow/45849807.cms,m.economictimes.com,State-owned banks may have to shell out more on perpetual bonds,"MUMBAI: State-owned banks may have to fork out reasonably higher rates on their perpetual bond issues, a riskier instrument compliant to the latest international bank standards -Basel III -as a slew of issuers are flocking back to the debt market in the January-March period, adding to the supply side. 

 Public sector banks may more than double Basel-III complaint issues (both tier-1 and tier-2) to around Rs 14,200 crore this quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey.Dena Bank, Allahabad Bank, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, UCO Bank, Syndicate Bank and some others are expected to soon issue perpetual bonds, or tier-I, for about Rs 5001,000 crore each, four people familiar with the matter told ET. 

 Corporation Bank, Vijaya Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce are set to finalise their deals after receiving most bids from arrangers who quoted 9.50-9.54%. Lenders could not be contacted immediately. 

 “If PSU banks' Basel-III bond insurances rise significantly by March, issuers may have to pay higher rates, particularly for perpetual bonds,“ said Shashikant Rathi, senior vice-president & head, Investment, ALM & Capital Markets, Axis Bank.“Perpetual bonds (tier-1) are riskier than tier-2 bonds. Prices should be reasonable in future as the spread is likely to rise.“ 

 Now, issuers seem to be enjoying a fine pricing with about 7580 bps spread, or gap, between two sets of bonds compared with 175-180 basis points five months ago and about 200 bps normally as per global practices. The spread is likely to widen by about 25-35 bps, dealers said. Under the Basel-III requirement, a perpetual bond is more of a quasi-equity obligation with no fixed maturity. If an issuing bank incurs losses in a financial 0year, it cannot make coupon payment to its bondholders even if it has enough liquidity. A tier-2 bond -an unsecured subordinated debt -comes with a fixed maturity. 

 Mutual funds (for credit opportunity fund schemes), exempted provident funds run by individual trusts, mostly invest in perpetual bonds. Those bonds are normally rated one or two notches below issuers' long-term rating. 

 For example, triple-A rated Bank of Baroda's perpetual bonds are rated as AA+. It has raised about Rs 1,000-1,500 crore at 9.48% by selling such securities. 

 “Large debt investors like insurers and EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation) are not there in perpetual bonds while they can invest in tier-2 bonds,“ said Arun Srinivasan, senior vice-president, investments (debt), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. “This combination will help expand the spread between two types of PSU bank bonds.“ 

 “Perpetual bonds come with fiveyear call options but it is not an automatic call option,“ he said, adding that there are stringent RBI requirements to be met before the option can be exercised. 

 Last August, state-owned Bank of India had issued first perpetual bonds to mop up Rs 2,500 crore at 11%. During the same time, Oriental Bank of Commerce had offered tier-II bonds 180 bps lower at 9.20%. Now, BoI's quasi-equity instruments are trading 150 bps lower at 9.50% in the secondary market as prices have moved up.Similar rated bank unsecured debts are trading at 8.70-8.80%. Allahabad Bank has raised Rs 500 crore selling tier-II bonds at 8.78%. 

 “Long-term investors would prefer tier-II bonds over perpetual bonds due to inherent risk elements,“ said Ajay Manglunia, head, fixed income, Edelweiss Financial Services. “Unless issuers offer the right rate they won't be enticing enough investments.“ 

 The overall yield-dip is due to fall in the government benchmark bond yields expecting a future interest rate cut by the RBI.

 Syndicate Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Dena Bank, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India and Andhra Bank aim to mop up a total of about Rs 8,000-9,000 crore in the current financial year, market people familiar with the matter told ET. 

 All bonds will be Basel-III compliant, a global standard for capital requirement. 

 Bangalore-based Syndicate Bank is expected to be the first one off the block, selling 10-year bonds to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore in 2014-15 to shore up its capital base. “We are planning to raise funds through tier-II bond sales. Our board has approved it as we need to fund our credit expansion,“ said a senior official from the bank. 

 Syndicate Bank may sell the bonds in two tranches as it expects rate cuts in coming days. It may sell Rs 750-1,000 crore in the first tranche before the month-end. 

 Syndicate Bank is in discussions with arrangers, which have already quoted 8.98-9%, about 68 basis points higher than the benchmark government bond yield on an annualised basis. Market sources said the bank is asking for 8.95% rate. “The bank has approached LIC of India to place those AA+ rated bonds privately. The largest insurer may have asked a higher rate at 9.05%,“ said one of them. 

 Bank of Maharashtra, meanwhile, plans to collect up to Rs 1,000 crore by selling similar securities. 

 “By December, we will raise up to Rs 1,000 crore additional tier-I bonds,“ its executive director R K Gupta said. “Actually, credit is expected to expand between November and March with some stalled projects opening up now. We should also see loan growth coming from retail, SME and agriculture sectors.“ 

 Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank, Central Bank of India and Andhra Bank, too, have plans to mobilise funds by selling bonds worth about Rs 1,500 crore, Rs 2,300 crore, Rs 1,300 crore and Rs 1,000 crore, respectively. 

 Market sources said most of these banks' boards have already approved these fund-raising plans. 

 Those banks could not be contacted immediately for confirmation and comments. 

 According to arrangers, all lenders are expecting a fall in interest rates and, hence, they do not want to raise the full amount in one go. 

 In the initial tranche, lenders would be selling bonds in the broad range of Rs 500-1,000 crore. Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali Life Insurance Company, feels that these bonds are good long-term prospects. “For any long-term investor, it makes sense to invest in these bonds with the government support, subject to their secondary market liquidity,“ he said. “BaselIII compliant perpetual or tier-I bonds should offer higher yields due to inherent risk element.“ 

 The benchmark bond yields have dipped 55-60 basis points in the last 5-6 months. Bond yields and prices move in the opposite direction. 

 This has given an edge to all issuers whose borrowing cost has come down significantly.

  MUMBAI: SUBHASH Projects & Marketing (SPML), a Kolkatabased infrastructure development company, aims to raise Rs 300 crore to finance its Bhiwandi water project by selling equity of the special purpose vehicle that has been created for implementation of the plan.
  
  “We are in talks with a couple of private equity and strategic investors,” said executive director Rishab Sethi, without disclosing their identity. A person close to the matter said US-based Water Asset Management LLC and Veolia Water have evinced initial interest to pick up equity in the project. SBI Capital Markets has been advising SPML on the fund raising.
  
  A special purpose vehicle, SPML Bhiwandi Water Supply Management, is setting up the project for Rs 700 crore. The company plans to raise Rs 400 crore debt for the project which is expected to be operational by 2012-13 . SPML will develop the project for Bhiwandi Nizampur Municipal Corporation and will also operate and maintain it for 25 years. “The project has potential of generating Rs 5,000 crore during the period, which will be shared between SPML and the municipal corporation ,” said Mr Sethi.
  
  The Bhiwandi project will supply drinking water to over one million people in the area. It will be one of the largest water management projects under public private partnership by the Maharashtra government after the sector was opened for private players.
  The Indian water and waste water market is pegged at $4 billion and is growing at around 12% a year, according to Virtus Global Partner, a global consultancy.
  
  Half of the revenue generated from the sector comes from the government run bodies and the remaining is contributed by the private firms. India plans to invest around Rs 1.4 lakh crore by 2012 for water management . SPML, one of the leading local players, earns about 62% of its revenue from water management services. It is developing projects in Maharashtra, Gujarat , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Last year, it registered sales of Rs 1500 crore.

Three reasons why India Incs credit scores are on the mend,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/three-reasons-why-india-incs-credit-scores-are-on-the-mend/articleshow/47116080.cms,m.economictimes.com,Three reasons why India Inc’s credit scores are on the mend,"India’s corporate credit score is improving, thanks to its lower debt burden and debt-rating upgrades outnumbering downgrades. According to Bloomberg data, the average ratio of upgrade to downgrade by the three credit rating agencies — Crisil, Icra and Care — is 2.35 in FY15, the highest since FY11.
 
 An improved credit rating also reduces concerns over lenders’ asset quality. Most corporates are rated between BBB and B that carry higher risk-weight and lock up more lender capital than exposure to Triple-A rated corporates. Thus, upgrades help banks to save capital through lower risk-weights.
 
 There have been more than 109 upgrades over the last three quarters as against 47 downgrades. Credit ratings have improved for companies like Ashok Leyland, Ranbaxy and Ceat, while Jindal Steel & Power, Parsvnath Developers, Everest Kanto Cylinder and Bajaj Electricals were downgraded.
 
 
There are 3 reasons for improved ratings:
 
 .. Corporates have put in efforts to cut cost. “We have seen companies finding innovative ways to bring down cost and ease the working capital burden,” said DR Dogra, MD & CEO, CARE.
 
 .. Companies are refinancing debts to lower interest burden.
 
 .. Third, since the more vulnerable companies were downgraded in FY12 and FY13, there have been lesser downgrades subsequently. Also, some of the companies which were downgraded two years ago have bettered their credit profile.

Top BSE stakeholder urges FM Arun Jaitley to review exchange norms,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/top-bse-stakeholder-urges-fm-arun-jaitley-to-review-exchange-norms/articleshow/47791895.cms,m.economictimes.com,Top BSE stakeholder urges FM Arun Jaitley to review exchange norms,"MUMBAI: Toronto-based investor Thomas Caldwell, who owns a 5% stake in the BSE, has written to the finance minister Arun Jaitely seeking a re-think on several norms that govern the stock exchanges. 

 Former RBI governor Bimal Jalan, who headed the committee to suggest norms for stock market related infrastructure institutions, had submitted his report to Sebi in 2010. The suggestions of the committee, which were accepted by Sebi in 2012, were criticised by some experts then. Besides restrictions on ownership of stock exchanges, Jalan also suggested a cap on profits made by the exchanges citing them as ‘public institutions’. The report disallowed listing of exchanges and placed restrictions on salaries of key managerial personals. 

 “As one of the largest owners of the NYSE, as well as an investor in 36 other exchanges around the world, we were stunned by the report’s deep flaws which were based upon the fallacious notion that exchanges were ‘public utilities’ and thus requiring profit controls, pricing, compensation and strict ownership,” Caldwell said in his letter. He said the Jalan committee’s thinking has infected virtually all exchanges’ thinking and regulation since. “The Jalan type control over so many aspects of exchanges is more indicative of a far smaller, less developed country. What the report said to the world is that India’s financial regime is still about favouritism, abrupt and dramatic ground rule changes, the old Indian bias for government control and a lack of confidence in its own capital market structures,” the letter said. When contacted, Bimal Jalan declined to comment.

 Vaya Finserv, a business correspondent for banks, will apply to become a small bank to commence lending and deposittaking activities in unbanked villages, said Akula. The company, populated by former SKS Microfinance staff and 65% owned by SKS Trust, may even seek a licence for a payments bank.
 
 ""Micro lending is my passion,"" said Akula, who was ousted from SKS Microfinance, the company he founded, in a boardroom battle. ""We understand lending to low-income people. We know what a Rs 25,000 loan means to them.’’
 
 Akula’s SKS became the only microlender to list on the stock exchanges with the backing of private equity firm Sequoia Capital and Infosys Technologies founder NR Narayana Murthy. He had a troubled relationship with SKS Microfinance.
 
 Though he sowed the seeds of growth as a not-for-profit group, it became a forprofit company. When he wanted to return after the company’s valuations turned into billions of dollars, the board pushed him back.
 
 The company also dragged the entire industry into regulatory quagmire with the Andhra Pradesh state coming up with rules after allegations of harassment by SKS staff. Subsequently, RBI came up with rules governing microlending with a cap on interest rates.
 
 ""I had a three year non-compete agreement with SKS and that is over,"" said Akola.
 
 ""The biggest learning factor was that hyper growth without commensurate systems"" is not the right way to run a company.
 
 Now that the RBI is calling for applications to issue licence for small and payment banks, Akula believes his expertise in microlending could be utilised to achieve financial inclusion. ""We are not overconfident, but we are hopeful,"" says Akula. ""This (Vaya) doesn’t have suited-booted people, but those who understand financial inclusion."" Akula would be the non-executive chairman of the company.

ET Now: What really did the trick for some NBFC stocks? 

 Prashastha Seth: There were rumours in the market that the new guidelines would possibly be slightly favourable to the NBFC stocks and things might not be as bad as what the markets were expecting. I track Manappuram and Muthoot, so I can comment on that. The results of these two companies have been fairly decent. They have been able to maintain decent growth. They have been able to maintain volumes. They have been able to maintain margins. 

 So some of the things that the markets were pricing in terms of strong degrowth in the volumes. So that is the reason why there are some amount of buying coming in, in some of the gold financing companies. People have realized that over a period of next three to five years these businesses could be a 15-20%. 

 Earning growth business where you could potentially make 18% to 20% ROEs and from that perspective the stocks were trading cheap. So to that extent, there is recovery in these stocks and as I said there were rumours that things on the regulatory front might be slightly better than the worst players of the market. So those two things combined, essentially lead to volumes, lead to price rise in Manappuram and Muthoot yesterday.

Why Sebi should not treat PE investors as a privileged lot,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/pe-vc-funds-with-five-or-fewer-investors-attract-sebi-scrutiny/articleshow/94287098.cms,m.economictimes.com,"PE, VC funds with five or fewer investors attract Sebi scrutiny","Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) funds holding money for 5 or fewer investors have drawn the attention of the capital market regulator.

Do such funds act as vehicles of family offices and promoters? Do managers of such funds come under the influence of a handful of wealthy investors? Is the regulatory interest a precursor to a broad-based rule requiring a larger number of investors?

While the intent of the regulator is unclear, the Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has in an email on September 12 --- a week after it asked PE and VC funds about their valuation practices --- sought various information on funds formed with a small club of investors, two senior industry persons told ET.

These funds have to give details of investors in a scheme: name of the investors; whether it’s an individual, company, limited liability partnership, or trust; the country of the investor; the amount it has committed and the quantum of fund raised. 

They have to also submit the name of the investee company, its country of origin, nature of business, and the instrument issued (equity, debt, convertible etc) to raise money. The details have to be provided for every scheme of an alternative investment fund (AIF) - the regulatory term for PE, VC and angel funds. Besides, the name of a contact person in every fund along with the mobile number have to be shared with Sebi.

“Usually, funds with less than five contributors (excluding the sponsor and the manager) are captive in nature. We have seen many family offices, large investors, and corporates using AIFs to hold stakes in companies. Probably, they don’t want to reveal their identities. Investee companies too prefer the name of a single AIF in the cap table rather than five different investors in the fund… But we don’t really know why Sebi has asked for the information. Maybe, it wants to know more about such captive funds,” said a person with a fund trustee.

According to Tejesh Chitlangi, senior partner at IC Universal Legal, while AIFs, unlike mutual funds, do not have any broad-basing requirement, SEBI may be examining the feasibility of introducing some form of investor broad-basing for AIFs. “But any such rule, if under consideration, should not be as stringent as the 20/25 requirement prescribed for mutual funds because mutual funds raise retail money unlike AIFs which approach big-ticket investors through privately placed AIFs,” said Chitlangi.

MFs have to follow a 20/25 rule under which every scheme needs to have a minimum 20 investors with no investor holding 25% units in the scheme. An AIF, however, can even have a single investor though not more than a quarter of the fund corpus can be invested in a single entity.

Also, it may be perceived that a small group of investors end up influencing the fund manager and the portfolio construction. “But such a concern may not be well placed as funds need to make a regulatory disclosure in case investors have any role in approving investment decisions, including through annual audit exercises. A fund of one investor is not unusual as India has typically been accessed through master-feeder type structures, where in addition to the feeder, the master fund may have only sponsor group participation,” said Richie Sancheti, founder partner at the law firm Richie Sancheti Associates (RSA).

In the master-feeder structure, a fund pool may be created in a financial centre Mauritius, Delaware, Singapore or Gift City, with subscriptions from a number of investors across markets, there can be a single master entity investing in the AIF in India.

“Sebi is asking for data for certain analyses. This will be used to take decisions on the policy front,” said a person close to the development.

Sebi has been gathering a wide range of data on AIFs, probably given the rise in their importance as investment vehicles. Often, such exercise can precede regulatory changes. On September 6, the regulator had asked AIFs to disclose their valuation methodologies – a query that assumes significance as most funds are close-ended vehicles investing in unlisted securities of startups. 

A week before that Sebi asked funds to spell out whether the sponsor and manager of the funds were owned and controlled by persons who are foreign residents. Even in the latest communication (dated September 12), funds with five or lesser investors have been told to declare whether their sponsors are controlled by non-residents. A sponsor contributes Rs 5 crore or 2.5% of the fund whichever is lower.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: The underlying strength has been absolutely impeccable. How much more to go before law of gravity and reality kicks in?
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: 8000 on the Nifty is coming and coming pretty fast. I have been travelling throughout the length and breadth of the country meeting our clients and investors post the budget and let me tell you, everybody is thinking the same way. That is, buying cheap stocks and compromising on quality. So buying something which is not quality but something which is cheap and avoiding that something is very expensive. But it is quality but these quality stocks are a part of the benchmark indices, whether it be the midcap or the large cap names. So it is not the surprise that the markets are going to do something different than what the general public is thinking and on that basis, even though valuations continue to become even more expensive for quality stocks because nobody is wanting to own them except institutional investors, markets are still headed higher. We should see 8000 on Nifty coming pretty fast.
 
 
 
 
ET Now: What is the sense that you are getting though once you see 8000 or rather even a 7900 on the index? Is it going to be the same scenario that we saw last time around when we hit 7800 where you get a patch of correction and consolidation coming in. Is that the cycle that the market is likely to follow?
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: The difference between 7800 previously which had come and this time around is that the high beta junk names or so to say bad quality stocks are still 20 per cent below those levels and at the same time, sector rotation, IT and pharma which was not like, have continued to do well, likes of consumer names have continued to do well. So going forward, the overall trajectory on the economy is also looking slightly better in terms of deficient rains having come down from 45 per cent to something like 27 per cent. That gives a further fillip to the markets and then further data indicators whether it be on the results front or whether it be on the IIP inflation numbers front. That will continue to drive the markets forward but the direction continues to remain positive.

Analysts' views on how to trade Reliance Industries ahead of its results,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/analysts-views-on-how-to-trade-reliance-industries-ahead-of-its-results/articleshow/21158356.cms,m.economictimes.com,Analysts' views on how to trade Reliance Industries ahead of its results,"
	NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is slated to come out with its earnings for the quarter ended June 30 post market hours later today.
	
	The oil & gas major is expected to report a net profit of Rs 5,289 crore, up 18 per cent Y-o-Y, compared to Rs 4473 crore reported in the year-ago period, aided by a sharp decline in currency, according to an ET Now poll.
	
	However, total sales for the current fiscal are expected to fall by 5.9 per cent YoY to Rs 89,271 crore compared to Rs 94,926 reported in the year-ago period.
	
	Shares of Reliance Industries which have second largest weightage in the benchmark index has rallied a little over 3 per cent so far in this week ahead of results.
	
	""What makes the current set up on RIL interesting is the fact that the stock has rallied in the last few trading sessions and is showing signs of gathering momentum as if markets have already sensed some substantial positives from its numbers on Friday,"" said Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com.
	
	""We expect the stock to break its near term resistance of Rs 920 and rally further from here as the stock looks bullish on its short and medium term charts after a long time,"" he added.
	
	Most analysts have a positive view on the stock and expect it to rally ahead of results. With expectations of positive results a good pop-up on the stock cannot be ruled out on Monday.
	
	The recent price movement in Reliance Industries is an up move from the support base of multi-year consolidation.
	
	The current up move from Rs 674 is a part of larger pattern formation that began from January 2008 top at Rs 1,626. It is a part of the five years of consolidation. Therefore, it is a good level to initiate long position at the current price of Rs 864.
	
	""If the pattern described above holds, and if the present multiyear consolidation continues and if the stock breakout of this multiyear consolidation, then the low of June 2012 i.e. Rs 674 would most probably not be tested for couple of years,"" said B irendra Kumar Singh, Technical Analyst, FRR Shares.
	
	""Strategy would be to continue to hold the existing long positions. In case of a correction fresh long position can be initiated between Rs 890-860 levels,"" he added.
	
	RIL trades at 11.3x FY15E adjusted EPS of Rs 84.4 and company's new refining/petrochemical projects are likely to add to earnings from end- FY15E/FY16E.
	
	Analysts advise investors to adopt Long Strangle, Long Call Butterfly, Long Call Ladder and Long Put Butterfly as some of the strategies that can be deployed ahead of RIL results and keep the position open depending on their own time frame or till expiry.
	
	We have collated recommendations from various analysts as to what investors should do with RIL stock ahead of its crucial results:
	
	Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com
	
	Reliance Industries might well fuel the next leg of the current rally and may scale to Rs 1050 levels should the results be to the markets liking.
	
	We recommend buying into the stock not only with the Monday's pop in mind but as a medium term positional hold with a 3-month target price of Rs 1065.
	
	Manoj Muralidharan, AVP- Derivatives, IIFL PReMIA
	
	The scrip witnessed excellent delivery of around 36.71 lakh which is almost 1.5 times more than 5-day average. A Rs 920 strike call option has seen excellent buying. Good put writing has been seen at Rs 900 strikes.
	
	A good cash-based buying followed by O-T-M Call buying along with long build-up in derivatives market, we expect Reliance to see positive momentum in short term, specifically tomorrow.
	
	Traders should take a covered call by buying, RIL July futures at Rs 915 and sell 940 strike call option at 11, with stop loss of Rs 880 for a target of Rs 940.

	STRATEGY NAME – Long Call Ladder Buy 920 Call @ 18 Sell 940 Call @ 10 Sell 960 Call @ 5 LBEP = 923 HBEP = 977 Max Risk = Unlimited (if RELIANCE continues to move above HBEP) Max Reward = 17*250= Rs. 4250
	
	Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Trader & Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal Investments
	
	Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is in bullish terrain. After a long bout of sluggish movements and range bound price action, the stock has managed to commit profits for its traders and investors on the buy side!
	
	RIL was sideways between Rs 775 and Rs 855. After having gone past the Rs 855 mark, it has seen a very smooth rally which has taken it to its present price level of Rs 915.
	
	Going forward, I am of the opinion the stock can achieve Rs 940 in the short term and can go past the 1000 mark in the medium term.
	
	Nidhi Saraswat - Senior Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
	
	Technically, the stock has shown consolidation within Rs 765-850 and then given breakout in last few weeks, which is positive indicator. Investors can go long in the stock with near term stop loss below Rs 880 and likely target of Rs 975-1000.

  ET Now: What’s the sense there on the charts, Crompton Greaves, even a BHEL, BEML, any of these counters that you have to your liking?
  
  
  Devang Visaria: We like BEML but again BEML and Bhel, both of them are so illiquid, so they just go into a lot of stagnation and suddenly you will have a burst on say a BEML. On a medium-term basis, we will look for targets of 1350-1400 for BEML and the stop loss here would be closer to 1080 but again it is like a low-volume play, so you need to be cautious on the amount of stock that you buy into this one.

	NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex ended marginally in green on Monday, as compared to its Asian peers which were weighed down by country specific macro data and on tensions between North Korea and the US.


	The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo declined 2.1 percent to 12,135.01. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.4 percent to 1,995.99. Benchmarks in Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines also fell.


	The 30-share index ended at 18,864.81, up 28 points or 0.15 per cent. It touched a high of 18,959.48 and a low of 18,796.60 in trade today.


	The Nifty ended at 5,704, up 21 points or 0.38 per cent. It touched a high of 5,720.95 and a low of 5,675.90 in trade today.


	“Today being very first day of FY14, many of the beaten down stocks gained momentum; such as STC, IVRCL, BF Utilities, Hindustan Copper, Madhucon Projects, Welcorp, HDIL DLF etc.,” A.K. Prabhkar, Senior Vice President - Equity Research at Anand Rathi, said.


	“Additionally, O.I post settlement is lowest in 8 years, so most investors are taking fresh positive for FY14,” he added.


	The BSE Realty index advanced 5.3 per cent, the BSE Capital Goods Index rose 1.6 per cent and the BSE Healthcare Index ended 0.97 per cent higher.


	The S&P BSE Sensex rebounded from its first quarterly drop since December 2011. The Nifty started the fiscal year 2014 with two back-to-back monthly losses and a 3.8% cut in the past quarter as disappointment with the budget and weak macros hit sentiment.


	However, today’s gains can be largely attributed to more of technical factors. Next likely trigger for the index is on Q4 earnings which will drive the index higher in April, say experts.


	Indian markets came under pressure in 2013, amid the weakening economic growth in a decade, widening deficits and the rising inflation. Today’s HSBC PMI report showed that India’s manufacturing expansion slowed to a 16-month low in March.


	“Indian markets are up largely on account of a technical pullback that should be seen as a continuation of the fierce short covering witnessed in the dying hours of trade on Thursday,” Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com said.


	“The current momentum may well push the Nifty further up t0 5725-5740 levels but is unlikely to get past 5750 which is going to be the most important resistance going forward,” he added.


	According to Saraogi, once markets are done getting over expiry pressures, the indices will resume taking cues from the global markets where weakness is likely to persist.


	Here is a list of ten stocks which are likely to be in focus throughout this week:


	Analyst: Vinit Pagaria, VP – Investment Strategies at Microsec capital Ltd


	TCS (BUY - CMP: 1575.75 SL: 1528 Tgt1: 1618 Tgt2: 1645)


	TCS is in a strong uptrend and has rallied smartly in this calendar year. The stock however failed to go down and has been consolidating in the 1530-1590 range. A move beyond 1600 is likely to trigger a fresh rally in the stock.


	Cairn India (SELL - CMP: 272.45 SL: 283 Tgt1: 265 Tgt2: 256)


	Cairn India has been falling continuously since the last couple of months. The downtrend is likely to persist further and any pullbacks up to 280 odd level can be used to sell the stock.


	Century Textiles (BUY - CMP: 287.05 SL: 265 Tgt1: 308 Tgt2: 335)


	Century Textiles has had a free fall from a high of 451.80 made on 7th January 2013. The stock is currently near its support levels and a pullback from here could take the stock higher up to 308 followed by 335 odd level in the next couple of weeks.


	 

	
	 

	Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (BUY - CMP: 1766.50 SL: 1710 Tgt1: 1832 Tgt2: 1895)


	Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is trading near its 200 DMA and the stock movement has given signs of a reversal in the short term. The rising trend of the stock is likely to resume again and the stock could rally all the way up to 1895 in the medium term.


	HCL Technologies (BUY – CMP: 795 SL: 776 Tgt1: 814 Tgt2: 828)


	HCL Technologies is in a secular bull trend and is close to its life high. The stock is likely to give a fresh breakout and move into un-chartered territory. The stock can be bought with a stop loss below 776 and a target of 828 in the next few trading sessions.


	Analyst: Gaurav S. Ratnaparkhi, Technical Analyst at Sharekhan Ltd


	Siemens: BUY, SL 529, TGT 594


	The stock on the daily chart shows a three wave set back, which is a corrective structure. Hereon it is expected to start fresh move on the upside. It can test its recent high of 594 with a potential to stretch beyond that


	Tata Global: BUY, SL 122, TGT 134


	The stock has taken support near the junction of the swing low & daily lower Bollinger Band. Daily momentum indicator is showing positive divergence. Thus the stock can bounce back sharply


	IFCI: BUY, SL 24.90, TGT 28.20


	The stock has formed an Ending Diagonal, which is a bullish pattern in this particular case. Near the end of the pattern the stock seems to have formed a Two Bar Reversal pattern


	Union Bank: BUY, SL 208, TGT 238


	The stock has taken support near 61.8% retracement of the previous rally. Daily & weekly lower Bollinger Bands are providing additional support to the stock. Thus it can go for a short term pullback.


	Brokerage Firm: SMC


	Gitanjali Gems: BUY, SL 565, Target 620


	It made a 52-week low at Rs273 on 25th June 2012 and 52-week high of Rs621.05 on 11th March 2013. The 200 days Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the stock on the weekly chart is currently at Rs316.10.


	The uptrend is intact in the stock and it is trading in a consolidation phase. Moreover, it has negated the weak sentiments in the major indices which could be considered a significant point in its continuation of upward momentum.


	One can ‘Buy’ in the range of Rs578-585 levels with closing below stop loss of Rs 565 levels for the target of Rs 620-630 levels.

Bill Gross' love for Mexico stays unchanged despite his exit from Pimco,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bill-gross-love-for-mexico-stays-unchanged-despite-his-exit-from-pimco/articleshow/47810608.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bill Gross' love for Mexico stays unchanged despite his exit from Pimco,"By Brendan Case
 
 New York: Bill Gross is no longer running the world's biggest bond fund, but one thing hasn't changed: his love for Mexico.
 
 In a Twitter post on Thursday, Gross said the country offered the ""most attractive yields in the world,"" a week after proclaiming on a CNBC interview that Mexico's government debt was his ""best"" recent trade idea. 

 The 71-year-old Gross, who departed from Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) in September, emerged as a Mexico bull three years ago when he praised its bonds and currency as the nation prepared sweeping changes to its energy policies. Now at Janus Capital Group, he's betting that slowing inflation will lead the central bank to keep interest rates lower than traders are anticipating. 

 ""He's postulating that Mexico will successfully see off inflationary pressures and the actual path of the policy rate will come in lower than what you're seeing in the forward curve,"" said Michael Roche, a fixed-income strategist at Seaport Global Holdings. ""He's sharing that observation with everyone and I must say it does seem pretty reasonable."" 

 Mexico was one of the top 10 holdings in Gross's $1.5-billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund as of May 31, using derivatives contracts to establish a bullish position, according to fund data on Janus's website. 

 Gross didn't respond to requests for comment made by telephone and e-mail to the investment company's press office. 

 Forward contracts indicate Mexico's central bank will raise benchmark borrowing costs to more than 7 per cent by 2020 from a record-low 3 per cent. Gross is buying contracts on yields for the 2020-25 period, according to an e-mail from Janus. 

 With the country's annual inflation rate at a more-thanfour-decade low of 2.9 per cent and the economy plagued by sluggish growth, it's not hard to see why Gross is skeptical rates will rise that high. 

 The central bank said just last week that the inflation rate will probably end the year at less than its 3 per cent target. That would be the lowest since 1968, when information on price changes was limited to Mexico City. And while central bank officials have suggested they're likely to raise rates when the US makes a move, the Federal Reserve has signaled its increases are likely to be gradual. 

 Gross is ""saying he likes debt in the middle of the range, with maturities of five to 10 years,"" Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura Holdings, said from New York.""The curve is pricing in rate increases but our view is that it might be pricing in more hikes than will actually happen."" 

 Gross started talking up Mexico in June 2012, when he said he favoured the na tion's bonds over German debt, citing the Latin American nation's higher yields and lower debt levels.While Mexico's peso-denominated debt outperformed Germany in dollar terms over that span, its 7.1 per cent return still lags behind the average for emerging markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

 In his June 10 interview on CNBC, Gross called attention to Mexico's inflation-linked bonds. 

 He said traders were demanding too large of a premium to buy the debt relative to similar US securities and that the Mexico bonds may also get a boost from a rebound in the peso, which had been ""trashed"" in recent months.

BSE plans foray into commodity trading; board gives nod for new platform,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bse-plans-foray-into-commodity-trading-board-gives-nod-for-new-platform/articleshow/44954525.cms,m.economictimes.com,BSE plans foray into commodity trading; board gives nod for new platform,"MUMBAI: Asia’s oldest stock exchange BSE will soon make a foray into commodity trading. A proposal to start a new platform for commodities trading was approved by the BSE board on October 20, said two sources familiar with the development. 

 BSE’s rival in equity trading, the National Stock Exchange (NSE), already has a presence in the commodity segment through a stake in National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange. Bourses such as BSE entering commodity trading are eyeing the passage of Forwards Contract Regulations Act (FCRA) that could boost trading volumes as it allows launch of further derivative products in the segment. 

 Earlier this year, the Kotak Group bought a 15% stake in the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). While the FCRA Bill was tabled in Parliament last year, the previous government did not pass it in the wake of a major scam at spot exchange NSEL. Despite the severe crisis post the NSEL scam, MCX still dominates commodity trading in India with close to 80% market share. 

 Experts said new players are hopeful that the supremacy of MCX could be challenged with advanced technology. Akin to the equity market landscape where NSE and BSE are the only two national-level exchanges, the commodity space is divided between two bourses — MCX and rival NCDEX. Data from the Forwards Market Commission showed the two share 99% of the total commodity market turnover with MCX leading with 80-85% market share. 

 There are a dozen other commodity exchanges, including National Multi-Commodity Exchange of India and ACE Derivatives and Commodity Exchange that see a negligible turnover. Commodity trading gained popularity in India after MCX was launched in 2004 and it saw a sustained growth till 2013. The segment witnessed trades of over Rs 6 lakh crore every fortnight. 

 Levying of a Commodity Transaction Tax, however, resulted in a near 50% drop in trading volumes in 2013. MCX is a leader in bullion, oil & gas and energy contracts while NCDEX focuses on futures trading in agricultural commodities.

 Besides, National Stock Exchange (NSE) would shift scrips of five companies to the restricted trading category. 

 The stocks would be transferred to the trade-for-trade segment or 'T' group with effect from February 23, NSE and BSE said in separate notifications. 

 Under the trade-for-trade segment, no speculative trading is allowed and delivery of shares and payment of consideration amount are mandatory. 

 The decision is part of a surveillance review to ensure market safety and safeguard the interest of investors, the bourses said. 

 Some of the scrips which would be moved to 'T' Group on the BSE are Bemco Hydraulics, Accurate Transformers, Southern Ispat and Energy, Genera Agri Corp and Autoriders Finance. 

 Clutch Auto, Elder Pharmaceuticals, JIK Industries, PSL Ltd, Tecpro Systems are the five companies that would shift to the restricted trading category on NSE. 

 Further, BSE and NSE also issued a list of stocks that would continue in the trade-for-trade segment on their respective platforms for their failure to convert mandatory 50 per cent public shareholding into dematerialised format. 

 While BSE has identified more than 800 companies whose securities will remain under restricted category, NSE has listed nearly 41 companies. 

 As per Sebi guidelines, shares of listed companies which have not achieved at least 50 per cent of their public holding in dematerialised (demat) or electronic form would have to trade in the 'T' Group category.

What is your view on the index at 6250 and also your stock specific trades for this afternoon? 

 The Nifty Junior is down and even small caps are also not doing so well. Large caps are doing well. Sometimes small caps do well and at other times large caps do well. Banking is beginning to participate a bit. That is leading to some strength may be 80 to 100 points more to around 6350. I do not think you can take more than a 150-200 point view. The stronger groups on all sorts of correction should be bought. Try to keep away from the weaker groups where you have trading rallies. That is the trading strategy you have to follow. SBI, Kotak Mahindra have been beaten up. When that happens to a quality stock generally that is about the bottom because that is where larger players come into buy.

In a meeting with rubber industry delegation, development commissioner for rubber in the Ministry of Commerce J S Deepak has asked the industry to work out the details of the policy.
 
 “The government has welcomed our suggestion of having a national policy for rubber. In the next few months, the industry will hold consultations with all the stakeholders including growers, machinery manufacturers, synthetic rubber producers, manufacturers, importers, exporters and educational institutes and a draft report will be submitted”, said Niraj Thakkar, president of All India Rubber Industries Association (AIRIA), who headed the delegation to the Ministry of Commerce.
 
 According to AIRIA, rubber is a sunrise industry in India with immense potential for growth if policy enablers are put in place. A national policy on rubber is critical to optimize the potential of the sector. “We are awaiting suggestions from Sheela Thomas, chairman of Rubber Board, as a key stakeholder, on the national rubber policy with a view to giving direction to the industry’s efforts”, added Thakkar.
 
 According to him the government is supportive of increasing import duty on finished rubber products to address the challenge of inverted duty structure. AIRIA had asked for urgently increasing import duties on finished rubber products to enable local units particularly the SMEs face the challenge of fast growing cheaper imports.

 BANGALORE: The holding company of Café Coffee Day, India's biggest café chain, is gearing up to mop up Rs 1,200-1,500 crore through a proposed initial public offering (IPO) in about nine to 12 months.
 
 The domestic listing will see the holding company, Coffee Day Resorts, sell 10-15 per cent for $150 million (Rs 900 crore), valuing the group backed by KKR & Co at about $1 billion, sources in the coffee-to-technology conglomerate told ET.
 
 Private equity (PE) investors are expected to dilute up to 10 per cent of their stake. ""This is the right time to raise capital to fund expansion of our businesses,"" VG Siddhartha, the 54-year-old founder of the Bangalore-based group had told ET recently.
 
 The Chikmagalurborn coffee planter-turned-billionaire believes that the retail sector in the country offers a huge growth opportunity in the next five to 10 years. Interestingly, Siddhartha is not selling his stake in the group to demonstrate his faith and commitment to the Coffee Day growth story.
 
 The promoters are likely to seek a valuation of over $600 million (Rs 3,600 crore) for coffee retail, considered the jewel in the group's crown. It is expected to do an Ebidta (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) of Rs 200 crore this year. Siddhartha, who pioneered the café culture in India plans to add about 150 stores this year (2014-15) to the chain of 1,500 plus cafes.
 
 He wants to be a total of 2,500 (both café and express) outlets in three years. He is likely to plough back more than 70 per cent of the funds raised into retail business as Coffee Day gears up to ward off competition from foreign café chains, including Starbucks which entered the Indian market in October 2012 in partnership with the Tata group.
 
 Ahead of the listing process, the holding company's name will undergo a minor tweaking to reflect the group's conglomerate nature. The holding company has interests in coffee retailing, technology, logistics, and SEZ & hotels, besides smaller businesses like financial services (Way2Wealth), furniture (Daffco), and coffee plantations, among others.
 
 The promoters—Siddhartha, his family and associates—own about 70 per cent of the stake in the holding company, while private equity players, KKR, New Silk Route and Standard Chartered have the rest. The investors see the turnaround in the capital markets as a good opportunity to seek returns. The promoters and the holding company also own more than 20 per cent stake in the Bangalorebased IT services firm, Mindtree, which is valued at about Rs 1,500 crore.

Company Law Board accepts private equity investors' plea on Fourcee forensic audit,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/company-law-board-accepts-private-equity-investors-plea-on-fourcee-forensic-audit/articleshow/29223530.cms,m.economictimes.com,Company Law Board accepts private equity investors' plea on Fourcee forensic audit,"MUMBAI: The Company Law Board has granted private equity investors General Atlantic and India Equity Partners’ plea to conduct an independent audit of Fourcee Infrastructure Equipments to check alleged financial irregularities.
 
 The Mumbai bench of the CLB last week directed Deloitte Touche Tohmantsu India to conduct an independent forensic audit of Fourcee, a logistics firm specialising in tank trailers and equipment, and submit its report by January 31.
 
 “If it is found the respondents are not extending their co-operation and/or not taking appropriate steps required for the purpose of the preparation of interim report, further interim relief will be considered even prior to filing of the interim report,” the CLB said on January 13.
 
 General Atlantic Singapore Fund PTE and India Equity Partners (IEP), which have invested $107 million and $24 million, respectively, into Fourcee, had approached the CLB in October last year, saying they suspected financial misappropriation by promoters Rajesh Lihala, who is the executive chairman, and Vinay Singh, the managing director.
 
 The allegations surfaced after an audit of the books of accounts for year ended March 2013 by BSR & Company, an affiliate of KPMG. After this the PE funds, along with the board of directors of the company, appointed Ernst & Young LLP for forensic audit. However, after the auditor submitted its initial report, Fourcee filed a suit against Ernst & Young before the Bombay High Court, alleging force auditing and defamation.
 
 “Before Ernst & Young started with the assignment, the company has protested to the appointment of Ernst & Young, despite which the report was prepared on the instructions of the investors and without obtaining any clarification from the company or the promoters and on the basis of documents not procured from the company,” the company said in response to ET’s email query.
 
 “The proceedings that have been initiated by the investors are nothing but a hostile takeover attempt on the part of the investors to take control of the management and functioning of the company,” it said.

Cool-off period likely to continue for Sensex; top 4 events to watch,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ahead-of-market-12-things-that-will-decide-stock-action-on-monday/articleshow/89384753.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Monday,"NEW DELHI: Domestic stock indices climbed about 2.5 per cent last week, thanks to a strong Budget, even as weak global cues such as rising oil prices and volatility in US stocks kept the market on the edge. The broader indices traded in tandem, with key benchmark rising 2.3-2.6 per cent for the week.

This week will see investors reacting to the RBI policy outcome, its commentary on inflation, IIP reading, quarterly earnings and trends in the bond market.


Here's how analysts read the market pulse: Ajit Mishra, VP Research at Religare Broking, said supportive global cues, as well as growth-oriented Budget announcements aided sentiments but profit-taking in the later part marginally trimmed the gains.

""Participants will be closely eyeing the MPC’s monetary policy review meet next week and its outcome is scheduled on February 9. With the timeline set by the US Fed for tightening, it would be crucial to see how the MPC responds to it especially when the government has set the growth agenda in the Union Budget. Besides, on the macro front, IIP data will be released on February 11. We also have some big names like Bharti Airtel, Jindal Steel, ACC, Hero Motocorp, Tata Power, Hindalco and M&M will announce their numbers during the week along with several others,"" Mishra said.


US shares settled mixedWall Street stocks settled mixed on Friday as as strong jobs data raised expectations on a sharp rise rise in interest rates soon. The S&P 500 settled for a 0.5 per cent gain after swinging between a 0.6 per cent drop and a 1.4 per cent increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent after a last-minute burst of selling. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.6 per cent. The three indices posted a weekly gain for the second week in a row.


European shares retreatEuropean bourses on Friday retreated a day after the European Central Bank opened the door to hiking interest rates in light of inflation. In London, FTSE 100 fell 0.2 per cent to 7,516.40. In Frankfurt, Dx tanked 1.8 per cent to 15,099.56. CAC 40 in Paris trading declined 0.8 per cent at 6,951.38. The Euro Stoxx 50 was down 1.3 per cent at 4,086.58.


Tech View: Nifty50 fails in comeback attemptsAnalysts advised investors to maintain a neutral stance on the market.

""As long as the Nifty50 does not break below 16,850, it is more likely that the lower top formed on the daily chart may end up being a minor decline. Considering these factors we suggest traders to maintain a neutral to a mildly bullish outlook for the coming week. The immediate resistance on the higher side is placed at 17,800 level,"" said Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research at Samco Securities. 

Mohammad said it looks prudent to remain neutral and that intraday traders can short below 17,460 for a modest target of 17,350 level.


F&O: Opportune time to buy?On the options front, Maximum Call open interest stood at 18,000, followed by 17,500 strike. Maximum Put open interest was at 16,500, followed by 16,000 strike. Marginal Call writing was seen at 17,500, followed by 17,600 strike. Put writing was at 17,500 and 17,000 strike. Options data suggests a wider trading range between 17,200 and 18,000 zone, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

  You have also got some calls from the IT space, what exactly is your take on the sector as a whole and Patni Computers in particular? 
  
  The sector is very mixed right now. The most defensive stock in the sector Infosys is I think attracting a little bit of buying. It is just staying in a line. It is not really going up or down but its holding out nicely but there are stocks which are beginning to look weak. I would particularly highlight Patni which I have put as a short. MphasiS which has also been weakening. So you got a few stocks which are getting a little shaky. HCL technologies which you just mentioned. So situations are pointing to a mixed bag in IT, the defensives probably could do well when people are a little nervous about the market. The others could be a little volatile on the downside.

 The company proposes to obtain approval by postal ballot for a special resolution to authorise the board to offer NCDs on a private placement basis in one or more tranches to augment long-term resources for business needs, DLF said in a filing to the BSE. 

 ""This is a fresh enabling resolution that is required to be taken under the new Companies Act.

ET Now: What is it that you have made of the big pharma deal, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy and how would you approach the pharma space now?   Vijai Mantri: We have been overweight on pharma for a considerable period of time and what we have been telling for last one and a half year is that in any sector of the economy, the weaker player, the weakness could be for any reason are going to give way to the stronger player and we have seen same thing playing out in pharma industry.
 
 So it will be company specific. Even a small company doing very well, has well entrenched business model, then I do not see any significant risk to that company, however there is a possibility on the midcap space where some pharma companies would like to cash out and the kind of cash they get if the entire company gets sold out could be quite substantial.
 
 Many companies on midcap and the small cap on the pharma side has been promoted by promoters who are their mid 50s or 60s and they would like to cash out. So that kind of situation may happen but in large cap space as things stand, we do not see more consolidation happening because most of the players actually are well entrenched as on date.

IndiGo plans to raise $400 million by selling 10% stake via IPO,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/indigo-plans-to-raise-400-million-by-selling-10-stake-via-ipo/articleshow/47792371.cms,m.economictimes.com,IndiGo plans to raise $400 million by selling 10% stake via IPO,"MUMBAI: IndiGo, India’s biggest carrier by passengers carried, is planning a stock sale that may value the airline at $4 billion — almost eight times the market valuation of its largest listed rival.
 
 IndiGo is preparing to file documents for an initial public offering within the next 60 days, aiming to raise $400 million by selling a 10% stake, said a person familiar with the matter. That would give the airline promoted by Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises and aviation industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal a valuation of Rs 25,200 crore.
 
 This valuation is higher than what some industry officials expected. Comparatively, Jet Airways had a market capitalisation of Rs 3,242 crore at the close of trading on Tuesday and SpiceJet was valued at Rs 1,115 crore.
 
 IndiGo’s president Aditya Ghosh declined to comment on the company’s IPO plans. Although there has been talk of an IndiGo IPO since middle of last year, the airline has been looking to get its timing ""just right,"" the person said, without elaborating.
 
 The company will file a comprehensive IPO proposal known as a red herring prospectus with the Securities & Exchange Board of India, the capital markets regulator. Sebi usually takes 6-8 months to approve such documents, which means IndiGo’s IPO may possibly be pushed to next year.
 
 
CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE
 
 Investors have been looking forward to share sale primarily because IndiGo has been consistently profitable over the past few years. An IPO would enable investors to get astake in what is arguably the biggest success of India’s aviation industry, which has seen carriers such as Air Deccan and Kingfisher Airlines unable to sustain operations amid increasing competition, high costs and fare wars.
 

 IndiGo’s profit before tax in the financial year ended March 31 rose more than three-fold from Rs 477 crore in the previous year, the person said. The airline is yet to file its results with the Registrar of Companies. Its net profit in FY14 more than halved toRs 317 crore due to rising fuel costs and price wars. Consultant CAPA India pegged IndiGo’s net profit for FY15 at $175 million (Rs 1,111.6 crore).
 
 The airline has told its bankers it has cash of more than $1 billion.
 
 GoAir, the only other Indian airline that’s been profitable, posted earnings of Rs 50 crore in FY14. Jet Airways posted a consolidated annual loss ofRs 2,097.41 crore in FY15 compared with Rs 4,129.76 crore a year earlier. SpiceJet swung to a net profit of Rs 22.52 crore in January-March 2015 after seven straight loss-making quarters.
 
 
MAY OUTPERFORM PEERS
 
 Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises holds about 51% of IndiGo’s paid-up capital and US-based Gangwal’s Caelum Investment LLC owns about 48%. The remainder is held by Bhatia in his personal capacity, his wife Rohini Bhatia, his father Kapil Bhatia, Gangwal’s wife Shobha Gangwal and her sister Asha Mukherjee.
 
 IndiGo had a market share of 39% in May while Jet Airways and its subsidiary JetLite accounted for 21.5%, according to figures from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. SpiceJet had a 12% share.
 
 IndiGo has weathered the downturn in the aviation industry in the past few years better than its rivals and is expected to outperform them now that the sector is looking at an upswing. Domestic air traffic grew 13.9% last year while international passenger numbers increased 9%. The CAPA report said Indian carriers’ losses in this financial year are likely to narrow 40% to over $1.25 billion.
 
 IndiGo currently has a fleet of 97 Airbus A320-200s and has placed an order for 180 more A320 neos (new engine options) with deliveries likely to start at the end of this calendar year. It signed a pact in October for a record 250 planes. The airline also has exercise rights or options for 100 more aircraft.
 
 Last year, Jet Airways was valued at $1.58 billion (Rs 9,500 crore) by Etihad Airways, which bought a 24% stake in the airline for $379 million. The shares were valued at a 32% premium to their market price. Ajay Singh recently bought a 58.46% stake in SpiceJet with a pledge to infuseRs 1,500 crore in the airline.

Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO, 
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co Ltd.
 
 Talking to 
Sanjeev Sinha, Singhel says that risk-based pricing and not succumbing to market pressure will be beneficial for the industry in the long run. Excerpts from an exclusive interview:
 
 
Q1) What, according to you, are some of the challenges that the insurance industry is facing today? What are the emerging areas in the industry?
 
 India is a vast country with over 5000 cities and towns. However, lack of proper infrastructure is the biggest bottleneck faced by the industry in reaching out and tapping the enormous potential offered by these towns and villages. This under penetration is also due to a lack of financial awareness, complex products and wordings, low-perceived benefits and propensity to purchase based on reactive drivers like insistence by financers of home, business or personal loans or statutory requirements.
 
 Besides, the Indian insurance industry is still a fiercely competitive market with intense pricing pressures. The industry needs to correct pricing. Risk based pricing and not succumbing to market pressure will be beneficial for the industry in the long run. We are in the business of paying claims where profitability implies a strong financial position and the ability to honor claims.
 
 One of the most significant emerging trends in the industry is digital transformation. Insurance companies today are harnessing digitization and mobile technology to improve distribution and processes, empower and engage with customers and also for analytics that will help in detecting frauds. Besides digitization one of the positive trends in the industry is the rise in sale of retail health insurance policies. We hope that this trend continues and strengthens in the future.
 
 
Q2) How is technology playing a role these days in customer acquisition as well as new product development and market expansion?
 
 Technology has changed the traditional buying behavior of consumers even when it comes to financial instruments. Today, they are looking at ease of use, convenience and instant TAT (Turn Around Time). Besides, social media chatter has started influencing purchase decisions. The industry has embraced this mega trend and is increasingly using digital capabilities to acquire and engage with the consumer and other eco-system participants. Insurers are increasingly introducing self-service platforms, mobile apps and tablet based solutions to attract and retain customers. Today, we at Bajaj Allianz are using social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook as well as the popular messenger service Whatsapp to engage with our existing customers and reach out to new customers.
 
 Since technology has changed the way consumers make a purchase, insurers are now looking at creating products that are simple, involve minimal documentation and are more transparent so that it is easier for the consumer to make informed decisions and faster purchases. However, we still have some ground to cover on the product development front.
 
 Digitized distribution models are helping us reach the customers' doorsteps with insurance solutions as well as remote areas that were earlier uncovered. We at Bajaj Allianz have been able to reach out to 200 new markets last year due to our key initiative called Virtual Office. Virtual Office is an entire office run on a tablet via various applications. We are slowly trying to do away with the brick and mortar model.
 
 
Q3) Mis-selling and fraud are a common practice in the industry. What are the ways to curb them?
 
 Mis-selling and frauds have been an issue for the entire industry. Apart from creating dedicated cells in the company, digitized touch points and simpler and transparent products in future will help curb these practices. Today, data analytics is also proving to be an effective tool in the prevention of frauds. It helps identify and detect fraudulent patterns and triggers which help the claims team refer all such cases for investigation. Mis-selling will decline with an increase in digital sales interactions, clear communication and efforts by all players in the ecosystem to increase consumer awareness through all available forums. Social media must also be used for this purpose.
 
 
Q4) Your company had launched an all-women branch in Pune some time back. What was rationale behind it and what has been the customer response so far? Do you also plan to have more such branches going ahead?
 
 Realizing the large and untapped potential women offer, we came up with this platform - a dedicated branch to offer opportunities to women professionals, especially those who had to leave their careers due to family or personal commitments. The all-women insurance branches recruit and train only female agents and intermediaries. We launched a pilot project in Pune to gauge its acceptance and workability. The project received an encouraging response in terms of participation and the revenue generated. Therefore, we have now replicated it in cities across India. Today, with 30 established branches and some more planned across the country, it is a key strategic initiative of the company. We have also set up a support system for our women agents by providing them with an all-female staff, crèches, flexible working hours etc. We believe that with their unique qualities of empathy, patience and their attachment to issues related to health and home, women we will be able to drive insurance product lines related to these.
 
 
 
 
Q5) How are you planning to grow the different segments, particularly health, automobile and home?
 
 In the Indian automobile insurance space we are one of the leading insurers. To accelerate growth, our main aim will be to increase our reach, especially in the Tier 2 and 3 cities, by expanding our distribution network. We will also be focusing on the two wheeler segment.
 
 In the home and health insurance space, growth drivers would be:
 
 # Tapping new markets mainly in the remote corners of the country. # Awareness drives especially for home insurance, given that the penetration is dismal across the country. # Coming out with simpler, innovative and need-based product variants. Product innovation in health and home segments has helped our growth in these lines earlier too. For instance, Bajaj Allianz All Risk Home Insurance policy, a unique product launched last year with features that were introduced for the very first time in the Indian market, saw great response from the consumers. # Capitalizing on the existing channels by cross selling and up-selling. # Integrating with online aggregators and participating in government-driven schemes. # Most importantly, providing consumers with value addition.
 
 
 
 
Q6) What is your focus as the insurance industry is going through a slowdown phase currently?
 
 In the non-life space the slowdown was due to the unviable pricing and drop in sales in the auto-industry given that a large proportion of premium comes from the motor segment. However, we are now witnessing some growth given the rise in automobile sales and measures taken by the regulator to correct pricing in the industry. Meanwhile, our energies are focused on strengthening our home and health portfolios as well as distribution capabilities. An incremental effort on these fronts will positively impact our growth. Additionally, initiatives by the new government at the Centre, such as PMSBY, Smart cities, Digitalization, Make in India and Financial inclusion, will contribute towards economic and industrial growth, which in turn will lead to sustainable growth of the industry.
 
 
Q7) Are you planning to launch any new product or enter a new segment? 
 
 The industry today needs simple de-jargonized products that are easy to comprehend and purchase. Last year we introduced 3 new unique products - 2 in the health insurance space and 1 in the home insurance space, which received great response. Going forward, our focus in the product domain will be on creating simpler and transparent products that can be easily bought online and via mobile platforms. Last year we also ventured into the agriculture insurance market and till date have covered over 27 lakh farmers across various states in the country. Going forward we are looking at participating in the various weather-based insurance schemes proposed by the government and providing security net to a large farmer base.
 
 Besides, we will be exploring opportunities to provide more value additions beyond insurance along with our products. Currently, we provide over 20 value-added services with our health and motor insurance products.
 
 
Q8) What are your other plans and growth targets?
 
 Improving our penetration when it comes to personal lines of business is the key goal. Apart from this, we have 4 main focus areas which will play a key role in achieving our growth targets.
 
 # Distribution Transformation: Just as the government aims to reach the remotest corners of the country, our aim too is to take insurance to every city, town and village of our nation and reach out to around 300 new markets by the end of this financial year.
 
 # Customer Centricity: Delivering superior value with an excellent and caring experience for the customer. Most important would be providing ease and convenience with priority given to claims, billing and policy processing. Our mobile app 'Insurance Wallet' is a step in this direction.
 
 # Digital by Default: Every process to be digital, empowering customers and channel partners with low cost mobile solutions. Make our claim settlement procedures even more efficient in order to further reduce TAT on claim settlement for all lines of businesses.
 
 # Relationship Beyond Insurance: As insurers we want to establish a clear leadership in engaging with our customers beyond insurance. Currently, we provide a host of services like 24 X 7 free road side assistance for women, discounts on wellness services, apps that give access to online pharmacies and doctors on call, to name a few. Going forward we want to further innovate on this front. For instance, given the busy lifestyles that we live today, can we look at providing our customers with electrical or plumbing solutions as a value addition along with home insurance solutions?

"Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs global commodities research head, called gold crash right",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/jeffrey-currie-goldman-sachss-global-commodities-research-head-called-gold-crash-right/articleshow/19625761.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs’s global commodities research head, called gold crash right","Goldman Sachs’s Jeffrey Currie got ahead of gold’s biggest collapse since 1980 last week because he saw two signals most others missed. Prices that had risen for 12 straight years as investors sought a haven asset failed to rally amid turmoil in Cyprus.

Gold holdings in exchange traded funds tumbled at a time when interest rates remained low. Currie, the bank’s 46-year-old global commodities research head with a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, issued his sell recommendation on April 10, before gold fell 13% in a two-session plunge that ended on April 15, the biggest decline in 33 years.

Morgan Stanley and Bank of America followed Goldman, and the slump wiped out almost $1 billion of hedge fund manager John Paulson’s personal wealth.

“You had a whole group of observations that should have created a substantial rally in gold prices, but they didn’t,” Currie said by telephone from New York. “The fact that gold did not rally on Cyprus amid the bad US data that occurred in that time period created the conviction we needed.”

Cyprus Levy

Gold rose 1% in the week after March 16 when Cyprus announced an unprecedented levy on bank deposits, before erasing gains the following two weeks.

The country’s finance minister said on April 14 it may sell gold reserves to get international aid, helping extend a slump this week after the metal fell into a bear market April 12.

Bullion capped a record annual run last year as nations pledged more stimulus to bolster economic growth. Currie, who manages a team of 11 research analysts, first cut the bank’s outlook for gold prices in December, and then again in February, before recommending a short position on April 10.

The bank’s 12-month forecast is for prices to reach $1,390 an ounce. The target for the end of 2014 is $1,270 and prices may drop below $1,200 temporarily, he said.

Paulson Outlook

Gold’s price drop hasn’t changed billionaire Paulson’s intermediate to long-term outlook on the precious metal, said John Reade, partner and global strategist at Paulson & Co in New York in a statement on April 15. Bond buying by governments will increase demand for gold even as the commodity is “going through one of its periodic adjustments”.

Currie’s correct gold recommendation came as he celebrated his 17th year at Goldman Sachs on April 15. He joined the bank after earning his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1996, and became a managing director in 2002 and partner in 2008. He moved to the New York office last year from London, where he worked since 2003 and served as European co-head of economics, commodities and strategy research from 2010 to 2012.

Investors who followed Currie’s recommendation on gold would have earned returns of about 12% — not the best call he’s ever made. In 2007, he made a bullish recommendation on oil that yielded 23%. The price of crude touched a 19-month low in January 2007 in New York before surging to a record $147.27 a barrel in July the next year.

Another bullish recommendation on a basket of commodities in 2011 yielded 23%, while a bet on higher oil in 2012 lost 36%. In 2007, “it was much more of a contrarian call” than the recent one, Currie said.

	 


“We were fighting the tape in the sense that you had a substantial pullback in commodity prices into the first quarter of 2007. This time, if you look at a chart, gold was trending downward consistently, so this was less of a contrarian call than ones we’ve made in the past.”

While futures averaged a record $1,671 last year, prices were already in a five-month slump through February that was the worst since 1997 and a month before Goldman Sachs advised selling the metal.

Gold is now 28% below its September 2011 record. Not all of Currie’s recommended trades are winners. The bet on higher copper prices that was recommended on March 1 has lost about $498 a tonne, according to an April 16 report from the bank.

Global Market

Currie, who lives in Fairfield, Connecticut, said he travels 132 days out of the year. Members of his research team are based in New York, London, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.

“Unlike equities which are by definition regional, commodities are truly a global market,” Currie said. “That’s one reason why I’m on the road so much, because of that. It’s predominantly corporate players in the market, so I’m not going to places like Boston or Zurich. We’re going to places like Lagos and Johannesburg, as opposed to where the investors are.”

ET Now: What happens if DIIs stop buying into domestic equities? What if they decide to pull the plug?
 
 
Kunj Bansal: Healthy liquidity is critical to the market's performance. A lot of midcaps have fallen in the last few days due to drying up of liquidity.
 
 One must note that the impact of this reducing liquidity has been felt more on mid and smallcap counters. For largecaps, it is not a major concern so far.
 
 Overall, I must say that liquidity is a critical requirement for any buying as well as selling. Hence, what you are saying actually applies when there are people falling over each other to buy...
 
ET Now: Are you shopping right now or are you conserving cash?
 
 
Kunj Bansal: We are buying. We are regularly buying wherever we have cash or wherever we are getting inflows from our investors.

If that were to happen that should clearly add a lot of momentum to the Nifty, the good thing is that while the initial part of the Bank Nifty was being triggered by private sector banks like Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank.

Multi Commodity Exchange signs new technology contract with Financial Technologies India Ltd,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/multi-commodity-exchange-signs-new-technology-contract-with-financial-technologies-india-ltd/articleshow/43810983.cms,m.economictimes.com,Multi Commodity Exchange signs new technology contract with Financial Technologies India Ltd,"MUMBAI: Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) today said it has entered into a new agreement with Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) for availing software support and managed services till 2022. 

 The pact (supplementary agreement), inked on mutually agreed terms, marks continuation of technology partnership between the two companies, founded by entrepreneur Jignesh Shah, and comes as a shot in the arm for the commodity bourse as it seeks to launch fresh contracts. 

 In a filing to the BSE, MCX said the agreement was entered into with several changes. 

 As per the new agreement, MCX will pay FTIL a fixed charge of Rs 1.5 crore per month, including managed services payable in advance on semi-annual basis. Earlier, it was paying Rs 2 crore per month. 

 FTIL will also get a variable charge of 10.3 per cent of gross transaction fees as compared to 12.5 per cent earlier. 

 Last week, FTIL said it has signed a 10-year long technology contract with the commodity exchange (the new one is for 8 years), resulting in negative impact of nearly Rs 9 crore on its total income for this fiscal. 

 The Jignesh Shah-led company said, ""Due to this supplementary agreement, and based on the current volume of MCX and assuming MCX daily volume remains same, the negative impact on the total income of the company would be around Rs 8.82 crore for the period of 2014-15."" 

 In 2013-14, MCX paid about Rs 60 crore to FTIL for receiving technological support and services. The new pact will pave the way for MCX to launch new contracts for January to March period of 2015. 

 MCX is confident that it will be allowed to launch all its contracts for the year 2015 once the full divestment by FTIL of its stake in MCX takes place in compliance with sector regulator FMC's order. 

 On September 17, the commodity markets watchdog said the exchange can launch new contracts for first three months of 2015 after if it signs a fresh technology deal with FTIL. 

 FTIL had said that by entering into the new agreement, it has completed all formalities to close its sale of 15 per cent stake in MCX to Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

 FMC had said the exchange will be allowed to roll out contracts for entire 2015 once the full divestment of FTIL in MCX takes place as per the regulatory norms.

ET Now: I believe you will agree that private banks are not exactly cheap, sure enough some of them maybe but a lot of them are trading at highs that leaves the PSU banks, will there be clear money running into PSU banks and if so, would it be restricted to the top tier ones or would it find waves across the spectrum?  

 
Amit Shah: Let us talk about two parts of money – one is offshore money coming into India which will come in larger quantum and one is onshore money which is typical retail, HNI money which would get invested in and if you look their psyche, for foreign investor the first and foremost important thing for him is liquidity, that if I invest into this stuff, will I able to exit or not. So by that logic, the first round of allocation will come into more liquid stocks compared to more illiquid stocks which are typically of mid and small cap. 

 
ET Now: The likes of SBI, etc, you think will find favour.  

 
Amit Shah: Correct and then obviously private banks. Now private banks have its own challenges as you would be hearing in media HDFC has an issue where HDFC Bank limits are more or less there so the allocation has gone down, but given a choice obviously companies which are liquid is where the money would flow in. 

 If we see a stable government, in that scenario the first and the foremost thing the government would do or should do is essentially try and improve your banking system because that is a core to any kind of growth because any dollar coming in converts into $10 going out because of the money supply effect and I do not think so it is a difficult thing to do, it is a long term process but if you have a will one can do it and the classic example is if you look at power distribution companies in state of Gujarat, the way non-profitable structure has become so profitable, so the good part about India is we have policy framework in place which just need implementation in the right spirit and if government is determined, the core asset drivers which is a bank, infrastructure if they have that due attention and the balance sheets are helped to cleaned up, the growth numbers there can quite significant.

Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-likely-to-start-flat-on-muhurat-trading-day-may-reclaim-8k/articleshow/44917232.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat-to-higher on Thursday on the first day of Samvat 2071 tracking muted trend across global markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to head higher later in the session to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8000.
 
 US and majority of Asian markets ended on a muted note in trade as a shooting at the Canadian parliament unnerved investors, which triggered profit booking across markets.
 
 Today’s trading also marks the starting of Samvat 2071. It is considered auspicious to start something new on this date and for the same reason, many traders in the stock market too, make token purchase of shares, say analysts.
 
 Samvat 2070 has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The S&P BSE Sensex clocked returns of over 26 per cent in the same period.
 
 Nifty added 68 points to its values and ended at 7995 on Wednesday, whereas the Sensex ended higher by 0.80 per cent or 211 points at 26787.
 
 Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com is of the view that ‘Muhurat Trading’ session would only be a truncated. It might not do much to the index, but on the stock specific side, you could see some action happening, he added.
 
 Nifty cleared the short term resistance of 7970 level on Wednesday on closing basis. Now, the level of 8040 would act as a key resistance to watch out for in the immediate term, say analysts.
 
 ""If 8040 is surpasses we may see some further upside; however, higher up the next resistance is placed at 8090 - 8120 range,"" GEPL Capital said in a report.
 
 ""On the lower side, the immediate support is now placed at 7970 followed by 7930. It is very important that the index takes support in the range of 7970 to 7930 in case of a decline, else we may see resumption of the recent down trend that has come in force after it violated a key support of 7840 in the past week,"" added the report.

However, even this time the Nifty couldn’t cross its resistance mark. In the past couple of sessions, it is consolidating in a narrow range of 6000-6200. This is in sync with what open interest data for Nifty options indicates. Maximum OI is placed at 6000 put and on call side the same is at 6200 call. 

 F&O rollovers for the November series are strong, with both Nifty and the market witnessing above-average rolls percentage against average for the past three F&O expiries. However, this can also be attributed to lower OI base for the current month series. Rollover costs (cost to long rolls) have been shrinking since the past 2-3 trading sessions, which indicates that shorts are more aggressive in rolling their positions. We expect the November F&O series expiry in Nifty between 6050 and 6100. 

 The sentiment indicator, India Volatility Index (VIX) has been rising slowly as we are coming closer to state election dates. We believe if VIX breaches 21.5-22% range then it can test 26-28%. We will assign 70% probability for VIX to break out in coming days before the assembly election results on December 8. 

 In order to play this view we recommend generating a long straddle in Nifty at 6100 strike. The strategy is to buy 6100 strike call and put of December series, with outflow of 270-275 points.

"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/polls-could-be-a-big-swing-factor-for-indian-market-says-hsbc/articleshow/25992731.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC","NEW DELHI: The general elections could prove to be a ""big swing factor"" for the Indian stock market going ahead, financial services major HSBC said while putting a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014. 

 The Indian market has seen a modest gain of 8 per cent in the current year, but underperformed significantly in US dollar terms as the Indian rupee depreciated sharply in the second half of the year, the company said. 

 According to HSBC, the ""storm has abated"" for the Indian markets as the US Fed has deferred tapering of its quantitative easing stimulus, and as the new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has taken steps to contain the rupee fall. 

 However, ""structural imbalances and the election uncertainty should keep the outlook for 2014 clouded"", HSBC said. 

 ""We expect Indian equities to deliver a below average return of 3 per cent in 2014, while earnings should grow by 8-10 per cent,"" the HSBC report said. 

 ""We are underweight India within the region context with a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014,"" it added. 

 According to the global brokerage major, the upcoming general elections could be a ""big swing factor"" and an ""inflection point"" for the Indian markets. 

 ""In our view, if BJP-led National Democratic Alliance comes to the power, it would be positive for infrastructure -led sectors, while a Congress-led UPA government would be positive for consumption-led sectors,"" it said. 

 The report further said: ""Indian infrastructure spending is likely to rebound whoever wins next year's general election. We see capital goods companies growing profits by 15 per cent in calender year 2014"". 

 ""We prefer to play the market via export-oriented sectors, such as IT and healthcare, which benefit from a weak rupee, or USD proxy plays, such as energy. We are cautious on consumer discretionary, real estate and state-owned banks,"" it added. 

 Moreover, earnings estimates for IT and healthcare companies are likely to be upgraded on the back of sharp currency depreciation. 

 Historically, the Indian market has rallied sharply post any favourable election outcome -- a stable government with a single party holding a commanding position in parliament, the report said.

At 07:45 am, Nifty50 futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 11.50 points higher at 7,945, indicating a flat opening in the domestic market. 	  	Asian markets were trading mixed. Japanese Nikkei was trading 0.42 per cent lower at 19,860. China's Shanghai Composite was down 0.72 per cent at 3,609.  	Among other Asian indices, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.64 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi (up 0.11 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.38 per cent) were trading higher.  	The business and consumer climate data for the euro zone will be released later in the day. Britain will report its preliminary GDP numbers for the September quarter. In India, weekly foreign reserve data will be released. It will also be the first day of the December series futures and options contracts.  	But all eyes will be on the ongoing winter session of Parliament. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Thursday to pay tribute to sitting member Khekiho Zhimomi of Nagaland People's Front, who had passed away earlier in the day.  	""My sense is that the initial phase will be noisy, but the House will get down to business at some point. Once things get to that level, there will definitely be discussions on GST, because it is on top of the government's to-do list. The government will make sure that there is some discussion. One does hope to see the GST bill passed during this session,"" said C Jayaram, Joint Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank. 	Investors will also keep an eye on the dollar-rupee exchange rate and foreign flows trends.  	The rupee closed at an 11-week low of 66.57 on Thursday amid a sharp appreciation in the greenback globally on a likely shift in the policy stance by the US Fed in the December policy review. Hopes that the Fed may hike interest rate in the next policy review have triggered outflows from emerging markets. India has been no exception and has witnessed an outflow of Rs 6,348-odd crore so far in November.    	Market experts say even as the chances of a Fed liftoff in December policy are high, the next rate hike may not happen in 2016, as it will be the year of US presidential elections.  	""Fed feels it needs to be seen to be responsible. It almost never raised interest rates during an election cycle and the election cycle in the US will really start in six weeks. So, we should not expect to have much of a rate hike in 2016,"" said Paul Schulte, Schulte Research.  	Technical charts suggest rangebound trading ahead for Nifty50.  	""For Friday, I expect the market to remain sideways with a positive bias. The 7,800 and 7,920 levels on Nifty50 would be my range,"" said Sandeep Wagle of Power My Wealth.   	Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com said if Nifty50 breaks below 7,820, it would force him to cut long exposure and look aggressively to short some individual names.  	""But yes, from a stock-specific point of view, midcaps as well as some individual names have been buzzing. They are clearly seeing breakouts and some kind of good follow-up buying. So, maybe, one should focus on them with long positions,"" Thacker said. "

Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/private-placement-to-30-million-investors-wonders-sebis-chief-u-k-sinha/articleshow/21102546.cms,m.economictimes.com,Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,"NEW DELHI: Taking a veiled jibe at Sahara group, market regulator Sebi's Chairman U K Sinha today said a large company collected $4-5 billion from more than 30 million investors and claimed it was a 'private placement'.
 
 Sinha also said that the first regulatory agency that comes to people's mind is Sebi, whenever the issue comes to fore about investor protection in cases of deposit-taking by unathourised schemes.
 
 Without naming Sahara group, Sinha gave example of ""a large company"", which raised more than $4 to 5 billion from more than 30 million investors.
 
 ""And the company claims it was a private placement. Now, how a private placement can reach out to 30 million people is another question?"" Sinha wondered.
 
 As per the Sebi rules and the Companies Act, a private placement is defined as issuance of shares or other securities to a maximum of 49 persons and anything involving 50 or more investors is considered a public offer.
 
 Sebi has been engaged in a long-running case with Sahara group over refund of more than Rs 24,000 crore (about $ five billion) collected by two Sahara companies from more than three crore investors through issue of certain bonds.
 
 Saharas were asked by the Supreme Court last year to deposit the money to Sebi for further refund to investors after verifying their genuineness and the market regulator recently initiated a process for the refund.
 
 However, Saharas have deposited only Rs 5,120 crore with Sebi and have claimed that more than Rs 20,000 crore they have already refunded directly to the bondholders. The case is scheduled for further hearing by the apex court tomorrow.
 
 Speaking at a venture capital conference here, Sebi chief said that the regulator's aim is to protect the interests of investors and focus on corporate governance.
 
 ""When some company, which was not even registered with Sebi, raised money from ordinary investors in the country, for example in West Bengal, people started blaming Sebi.
 
 ""It is not one company and there are multiple companies that raised money from large number of investors. The perception was that money is lost,"" Sinha said, while adding that Sebi always steps in to safeguard investors' interest.
 
 ""So, we are accountable, as the first agency which comes to anybody's mind is, if there is any issue about investor protection, that's Sebi. We have to be careful about that,"" he said.

The company currently derives a bulk of its Rs 21,000-crore turnover from manufacturing and selling jewellery to retailers in the local as well as export markets. 

 The company intends to increase its retail outlets to 125 from 73 stores currently in Karnataka by the end of April 2012 and a total of 550 stores across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala by the end of 2014. For this, it intends to raise Rs 2,500 crore through external commercial borrowing (ECB), Rs 2,000 crore through internal accruals and Rs 2,000 crore through supplier's credit. The proceeds from the ECB will be used to buy gold, said Mehta. 

 The company imports gold dore, or impure gold, from mines overseas and manufactures jewellery at its Bangalore headquarters. ""Since we are fully integrated, we will be able to cut down the supply chain and offer gold jewellery 10-20% cheaper than our rivals,"" claimed Mehta. 

 The company follows an associate model for its retail foray, refurbishing existing stores of jewellers who apply to become its associates and stocking it with its own inventory. The day-to-day cost of the establishment is to be borne by the associates but Rajesh Exports bears the advertising cost apart from providing inventory.

  Let us get your view on the refiners because I have read a couple of reports that seem to feel that really quite sceptical about the fact that the government will indeed do something which will really be meaningful in terms of giving a boost to bottom line for all of these companies technically how do they look?
  
  At the moment they are obviously with that bit of a sell off yesterday and the day before they are under pressure but it would appear to be short term pressure because all these companies are very much just a little bit below their highs especially Bharat Petroleum they are life time highs. 
  
  Now, they are not too many stocks in the market which are really there so given that the long term trend in these stocks are stable but one thing to remember about these stocks is they go up during market downtrends and they fall during uptrends and this is exactly what is happening again. Primarily related to the trend in crude oil price, crude oil tends to go up with the markets and these stocks tend to go down with crude oil so that's really what has been happening here.

 Tendulkar and Warne are in the US as captains of an inaugural all-star line-up of 28 cricket legends from across the world for the first ever 'Cricket All Stars' series in the US. 

 Tendulkar and Warne will visit the stock exchange to highlight the inaugural cricket series which will take place in New York, Houston and Los Angeles. They will ring the opening bell at 9:30m New York time that will mark the start of the trading day. 

 The historic tour marks the first time Tendulkar and Warne will play on US soil. 

 The 'Cricket All-Stars' kicks off on November 7 at Citi Field in New York City with a special opening ceremony prior to the match as well as other functions and galas. 

 The second match will be on November 11 in Houston and the final match in the series will be on November 14 in Los Angeles, followed by a special trophy presentation to the winning team. 

 In the past, several Indian dignitaries, including political leaders and businessmen, have rung the opening and closing bell at the stock exchange and at NASDAQ. 

 Given that cricket is not a popular sport in America, it is the first time that cricketers will ring the ceremonial bell at the stock exchange. 

 Through extensive promotions and media appearances, Tendulkar said the idea behind the series is not only to popularise the game in America but to globalise it as there is need to have more countries play the sport competitively in tournaments like the World Cup. 

 ""The reason for picking up a cricket bat again after retirement is to globalise cricket. That is a dream and vision Warne and I have. One day we would like the American (cricket) team also to participate in the World Cup. It would be a great moment. All cricketers have also been endorsing for having cricket in the Olympics. This is the beginning,"" Tendulkar told reporters yesterday.

Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-wants-bourses-to-provide-a-level-playing-field-for-hft-traders/articleshow/33577070.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi wants stock exchanges in India to provide a level playing field for traders who use high frequency trading (HFT) through co-location and those without the facility. 

 The debate over the use of HFT has resurfaced after the recent release of Michael Lewis’ book Flash Boys, which is critical of the system. The discussion within Sebi is that stock exchanges should implement its guidelines issued last year, which states there should be a two-queue system for orders coming from co-location and other mode. 

 Such an architecture will provide orders generated from a space not co-located a fair chance of execution and address concerns related to being crowded-out by orders placed from co-location, a Sebi official said. 

 Co-location is like proximity hosting, where the exchange hosts the subscriber’s server at its data centre near the master trading engine and helps in faster movement of data and execution of trades. Not all traders can use co-location as setting up the infrastructure involves huge costs. Both National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the BSE do not follow any separate queue system currently. 

 The two-queue system would ensure stockbrokers who are not co-located have a fair and equitable access to the stock exchange’s trading systems, said Sebi. The regulator had said distribution ratio of orders from terminals/servers that are not co-located to the orders from co-located servers may be kept at 1:1 and, in future, it may be reviewed based on the feedback from market participants. 

 ""Conceptually, I am not against such a system,"" said Rajesh Baheti, managing director of Mumbai-based Crosseas Capital, one of the largest domestic arbitrageurs using HFT. ""It should be seen if such technology is possible and the results should be measurable."" 

 Lewis argues in his book that the $23-trillion US stock market is rigged in favour of HFT traders, who prey on slower investors by getting early access to non-public information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US is already probing potential criminal activity associated with HFT. 

 On April 4, US attorney general Eric Holder said the justice department is investigating whether HFT violates insider-trading laws. Many other brokers believe the debate over HFT versus non-HFT is a question of market integrity. ""Many private investors do not participate as their orders are executed at a slower speed during events or major news. They believe that markets are rigged against them,"" said a Delhi-based broker. 

 The NSE did not comment on the issue. The BSE said it will continue to implement all Sebi policies in earnest and currently it does not give any priority to HFT traders in terms of information or matching of orders. But then sources close to NSE say the exchange, too, does not allow order matching on priority basis to HFT traders and they get matched as and when they come. 

 As per the latest data on NSE, HFT constitutes 17.15 per cent of the overall trading volumes. HF proponents say Sebi’s suggestion cannot be implemented. ""People will stop co-locating,"" said Hirander Misra, CEO, Global Markets Exchange Group. 

 ""Co-location is mainly for time priority. It gives liquidity to markets with high number of passive orders. If you say orders that come first may not go first, then people will stop using it. Separate order queues will close down co-location.""

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: In the near term though, does it seem like there are any indications of the market getting overheated? Does it seem like the rally could pause - not because of us, but because of the global developments at play right now? 

 
Arindam Ghosh: India has a strong chance of getting de-coupled and the probability of that getting pronounced is going to be incrementally high, because of both domestic and global factors at play. 

 I can point out three domestic factors at this point. One is inflation, which is coming off at a trajectory much sharper than what it was originally estimated to be. Secondly, we are closer than earlier to turn in the monetary cycle. Lastly, growth is definitely showing steady signs of pickup. 

 Add to this the windfall of the global factor in terms of international crude prices, and India looks to be the second best market after US. 

 Hence, irrespective of what happens globally, we really do not anticipate any over-the-cliff kind of a situation. Nevertheless, even in an environment where growth has actually been slowing down, we have the Eurozone which is faltering and we have emerging markets which is battling a slowdown in growth and monetary tightening. 

 On the other hand, you have India, which is actually in a very sweet spot. India will keep on getting more than proportionate share of the allocation when it comes to global and regional allocations. Barring any geopolitical escalation - which is always a possibility - we feel that India, over the long term, definitely looks to be on the up.

 However in general, it is expected of this current government that they will improve the efficiencies of the PSU stocks and so there is a lot of positivity around PSU stocks at this point of time.

  Kolkata-based Simplex Infrastructure was one of the few small-sized construction firms which did not participate in the recent rally in construction & infrastructure firms. This underperformance could be attributed to the lower margins reflected in the third quarter results of the company. 
  
  At a time when small- sized construction firms have reported a net profit margin of 4-5%, Simplex Infrastructure reported a net profit margin of 1.1% in the quarter ending December 2011. This is due to a foreign exchange loss of 3.3 crore and one-time start-up cost for a few projects. 
  
  Another reason for lower profits is high debt. At the end of September 2011, the company had a debt to equity ratio of 1.64. This is higher in comparison to its peers such as Unity Infra Projects and Pratibha Industries, which have a debt to equity ratio of 1.1 each. 
  
  As a result, a significant amount of the company's operating profits is used for servicing debt. In the December 2011 quarter, its interest expense was 42% to its operating profits. 
  
  In the coming quarters, a strong order book would help the company in allaying these concerns. The company has a healthy order book of 14,441 crore, which is nearly three times its FY11 revenues. 
  
  At a time when most construction companies are facing a dearth of new orders, Simplex Infrastructure has been able to secure nearly 4,162 crore worth of orders in the first nine months of this financial year. One of the main reasons for securing new orders is its execution capability. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Besides, the company's working capital days have also improved in the last few months. Its working capital days improved from 136 days in September 2011 to 120 days in December 2011 quarter, a reflection of the fact that the company has managed its working capital quite effectively in a high interest rate regime. 
  
  Also the fact that the company's order book is well-diversified, helps it weather any slowdown in one particular sector. Of the total order book of 14,441 crore, the company has an exposure of close to 27% to construction activities related to buildings and housing, followed by 26% in power, 11% in roads, and 14% in industrial sectors. On a trailing twelve months basis, the company is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 9.6.

  Banking pack has been doing very well and Syndicate Bank can be bought at around 137. Keep a stop loss of 131 and you have a first target of 142, then 149 and then maybe a slightly stretched target of 161.

Multi Commodity Exchange signs new technology contract with Financial Technologies India Ltd,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/multi-commodity-exchange-signs-new-technology-contract-with-financial-technologies-india-ltd/articleshow/43810983.cms,m.economictimes.com,Multi Commodity Exchange signs new technology contract with Financial Technologies India Ltd,"MUMBAI: Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) today said it has entered into a new agreement with Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) for availing software support and managed services till 2022. 

 The pact (supplementary agreement), inked on mutually agreed terms, marks continuation of technology partnership between the two companies, founded by entrepreneur Jignesh Shah, and comes as a shot in the arm for the commodity bourse as it seeks to launch fresh contracts. 

 In a filing to the BSE, MCX said the agreement was entered into with several changes. 

 As per the new agreement, MCX will pay FTIL a fixed charge of Rs 1.5 crore per month, including managed services payable in advance on semi-annual basis. Earlier, it was paying Rs 2 crore per month. 

 FTIL will also get a variable charge of 10.3 per cent of gross transaction fees as compared to 12.5 per cent earlier. 

 Last week, FTIL said it has signed a 10-year long technology contract with the commodity exchange (the new one is for 8 years), resulting in negative impact of nearly Rs 9 crore on its total income for this fiscal. 

 The Jignesh Shah-led company said, ""Due to this supplementary agreement, and based on the current volume of MCX and assuming MCX daily volume remains same, the negative impact on the total income of the company would be around Rs 8.82 crore for the period of 2014-15."" 

 In 2013-14, MCX paid about Rs 60 crore to FTIL for receiving technological support and services. The new pact will pave the way for MCX to launch new contracts for January to March period of 2015. 

 MCX is confident that it will be allowed to launch all its contracts for the year 2015 once the full divestment by FTIL of its stake in MCX takes place in compliance with sector regulator FMC's order. 

 On September 17, the commodity markets watchdog said the exchange can launch new contracts for first three months of 2015 after if it signs a fresh technology deal with FTIL. 

 FTIL had said that by entering into the new agreement, it has completed all formalities to close its sale of 15 per cent stake in MCX to Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

 FMC had said the exchange will be allowed to roll out contracts for entire 2015 once the full divestment of FTIL in MCX takes place as per the regulatory norms.

New govt should implement policies to revive the banking sector: Amit Shah,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/new-govt-should-implement-policies-to-revive-the-banking-sector-amit-shah/articleshow/35161556.cms,m.economictimes.com,New govt should implement policies to revive the banking sector: Amit Shah,"In a chat with ET Now, Amit Shah, Managing Partner, IIFL Wealth, shares his views on banking stocks. 

 
ET Now: I believe you will agree that private banks are not exactly cheap, sure enough some of them maybe but a lot of them are trading at highs that leaves the PSU banks, will there be clear money running into PSU banks and if so, would it be restricted to the top tier ones or would it find waves across the spectrum?  

 
Amit Shah: Let us talk about two parts of money – one is offshore money coming into India which will come in larger quantum and one is onshore money which is typical retail, HNI money which would get invested in and if you look their psyche, for foreign investor the first and foremost important thing for him is liquidity, that if I invest into this stuff, will I able to exit or not. So by that logic, the first round of allocation will come into more liquid stocks compared to more illiquid stocks which are typically of mid and small cap. 

 
ET Now: The likes of SBI, etc, you think will find favour.  

 
Amit Shah: Correct and then obviously private banks. Now private banks have its own challenges as you would be hearing in media HDFC has an issue where HDFC Bank limits are more or less there so the allocation has gone down, but given a choice obviously companies which are liquid is where the money would flow in. 

 If we see a stable government, in that scenario the first and the foremost thing the government would do or should do is essentially try and improve your banking system because that is a core to any kind of growth because any dollar coming in converts into $10 going out because of the money supply effect and I do not think so it is a difficult thing to do, it is a long term process but if you have a will one can do it and the classic example is if you look at power distribution companies in state of Gujarat, the way non-profitable structure has become so profitable, so the good part about India is we have policy framework in place which just need implementation in the right spirit and if government is determined, the core asset drivers which is a bank, infrastructure if they have that due attention and the balance sheets are helped to cleaned up, the growth numbers there can quite significant.

Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-likely-to-start-flat-on-muhurat-trading-day-may-reclaim-8k/articleshow/44917232.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty likely to start flat on 'Muhurat Trading' day; may reclaim 8k,"NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat-to-higher on Thursday on the first day of Samvat 2071 tracking muted trend across global markets. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to head higher later in the session to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8000.
 
 US and majority of Asian markets ended on a muted note in trade as a shooting at the Canadian parliament unnerved investors, which triggered profit booking across markets.
 
 Today’s trading also marks the starting of Samvat 2071. It is considered auspicious to start something new on this date and for the same reason, many traders in the stock market too, make token purchase of shares, say analysts.
 
 Samvat 2070 has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The S&P BSE Sensex clocked returns of over 26 per cent in the same period.
 
 Nifty added 68 points to its values and ended at 7995 on Wednesday, whereas the Sensex ended higher by 0.80 per cent or 211 points at 26787.
 
 Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com is of the view that ‘Muhurat Trading’ session would only be a truncated. It might not do much to the index, but on the stock specific side, you could see some action happening, he added.
 
 Nifty cleared the short term resistance of 7970 level on Wednesday on closing basis. Now, the level of 8040 would act as a key resistance to watch out for in the immediate term, say analysts.
 
 ""If 8040 is surpasses we may see some further upside; however, higher up the next resistance is placed at 8090 - 8120 range,"" GEPL Capital said in a report.
 
 ""On the lower side, the immediate support is now placed at 7970 followed by 7930. It is very important that the index takes support in the range of 7970 to 7930 in case of a decline, else we may see resumption of the recent down trend that has come in force after it violated a key support of 7840 in the past week,"" added the report.

However, even this time the Nifty couldn’t cross its resistance mark. In the past couple of sessions, it is consolidating in a narrow range of 6000-6200. This is in sync with what open interest data for Nifty options indicates. Maximum OI is placed at 6000 put and on call side the same is at 6200 call. 

 F&O rollovers for the November series are strong, with both Nifty and the market witnessing above-average rolls percentage against average for the past three F&O expiries. However, this can also be attributed to lower OI base for the current month series. Rollover costs (cost to long rolls) have been shrinking since the past 2-3 trading sessions, which indicates that shorts are more aggressive in rolling their positions. We expect the November F&O series expiry in Nifty between 6050 and 6100. 

 The sentiment indicator, India Volatility Index (VIX) has been rising slowly as we are coming closer to state election dates. We believe if VIX breaches 21.5-22% range then it can test 26-28%. We will assign 70% probability for VIX to break out in coming days before the assembly election results on December 8. 

 In order to play this view we recommend generating a long straddle in Nifty at 6100 strike. The strategy is to buy 6100 strike call and put of December series, with outflow of 270-275 points. This strategy will make money if we see extreme moves on either side along with increase in implied volatility (IVs).

"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/polls-could-be-a-big-swing-factor-for-indian-market-says-hsbc/articleshow/25992731.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Polls could be a big swing factor for Indian market, says HSBC","NEW DELHI: The general elections could prove to be a ""big swing factor"" for the Indian stock market going ahead, financial services major HSBC said while putting a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014. 

 The Indian market has seen a modest gain of 8 per cent in the current year, but underperformed significantly in US dollar terms as the Indian rupee depreciated sharply in the second half of the year, the company said. 

 According to HSBC, the ""storm has abated"" for the Indian markets as the US Fed has deferred tapering of its quantitative easing stimulus, and as the new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has taken steps to contain the rupee fall. 

 However, ""structural imbalances and the election uncertainty should keep the outlook for 2014 clouded"", HSBC said. 

 ""We expect Indian equities to deliver a below average return of 3 per cent in 2014, while earnings should grow by 8-10 per cent,"" the HSBC report said. 

 ""We are underweight India within the region context with a Sensex target of 21,750 for end-2014,"" it added. 

 According to the global brokerage major, the upcoming general elections could be a ""big swing factor"" and an ""inflection point"" for the Indian markets. 

 ""In our view, if BJP-led National Democratic Alliance comes to the power, it would be positive for infrastructure -led sectors, while a Congress-led UPA government would be positive for consumption-led sectors,"" it said. 

 The report further said: ""Indian infrastructure spending is likely to rebound whoever wins next year's general election. We see capital goods companies growing profits by 15 per cent in calender year 2014"". 

 ""We prefer to play the market via export-oriented sectors, such as IT and healthcare, which benefit from a weak rupee, or USD proxy plays, such as energy. We are cautious on consumer discretionary, real estate and state-owned banks,"" it added. 

 Moreover, earnings estimates for IT and healthcare companies are likely to be upgraded on the back of sharp currency depreciation. 

 Historically, the Indian market has rallied sharply post any favourable election outcome -- a stable government with a single party holding a commanding position in parliament, the report said.

At 07:45 am, Nifty50 futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 11.50 points higher at 7,945, indicating a flat opening in the domestic market. 	  	Asian markets were trading mixed. Japanese Nikkei was trading 0.42 per cent lower at 19,860. China's Shanghai Composite was down 0.72 per cent at 3,609.  	Among other Asian indices, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.64 per cent, while South Korea's Kospi (up 0.11 per cent) and Taiwan's TWSE (up 0.38 per cent) were trading higher.  	The business and consumer climate data for the euro zone will be released later in the day. Britain will report its preliminary GDP numbers for the September quarter. In India, weekly foreign reserve data will be released. It will also be the first day of the December series futures and options contracts.  	But all eyes will be on the ongoing winter session of Parliament. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Thursday to pay tribute to sitting member Khekiho Zhimomi of Nagaland People's Front, who had passed away earlier in the day.  	""My sense is that the initial phase will be noisy, but the House will get down to business at some point. Once things get to that level, there will definitely be discussions on GST, because it is on top of the government's to-do list. The government will make sure that there is some discussion. One does hope to see the GST bill passed during this session,"" said C Jayaram, Joint Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank. 	Investors will also keep an eye on the dollar-rupee exchange rate and foreign flows trends.  	The rupee closed at an 11-week low of 66.57 on Thursday amid a sharp appreciation in the greenback globally on a likely shift in the policy stance by the US Fed in the December policy review. Hopes that the Fed may hike interest rate in the next policy review have triggered outflows from emerging markets. India has been no exception and has witnessed an outflow of Rs 6,348-odd crore so far in November.    	Market experts say even as the chances of a Fed liftoff in December policy are high, the next rate hike may not happen in 2016, as it will be the year of US presidential elections.  	""Fed feels it needs to be seen to be responsible. It almost never raised interest rates during an election cycle and the election cycle in the US will really start in six weeks. So, we should not expect to have much of a rate hike in 2016,"" said Paul Schulte, Schulte Research.  	Technical charts suggest rangebound trading ahead for Nifty50.  	""For Friday, I expect the market to remain sideways with a positive bias. The 7,800 and 7,920 levels on Nifty50 would be my range,"" said Sandeep Wagle of Power My Wealth.   	Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com said if Nifty50 breaks below 7,820, it would force him to cut long exposure and look aggressively to short some individual names.  	""But yes, from a stock-specific point of view, midcaps as well as some individual names have been buzzing. They are clearly seeing breakouts and some kind of good follow-up buying. So, maybe, one should focus on them with long positions,"" Thacker said. "

Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/private-placement-to-30-million-investors-wonders-sebis-chief-u-k-sinha/articleshow/21102546.cms,m.economictimes.com,Private placement to 30 million investors? wonders Sebi's chief U K Sinha,"NEW DELHI: Taking a veiled jibe at Sahara group, market regulator Sebi's Chairman U K Sinha today said a large company collected $4-5 billion from more than 30 million investors and claimed it was a 'private placement'.
 
 Sinha also said that the first regulatory agency that comes to people's mind is Sebi, whenever the issue comes to fore about investor protection in cases of deposit-taking by unathourised schemes.
 
 Without naming Sahara group, Sinha gave example of ""a large company"", which raised more than $4 to 5 billion from more than 30 million investors.
 
 ""And the company claims it was a private placement. Now, how a private placement can reach out to 30 million people is another question?"" Sinha wondered.
 
 As per the Sebi rules and the Companies Act, a private placement is defined as issuance of shares or other securities to a maximum of 49 persons and anything involving 50 or more investors is considered a public offer.
 
 Sebi has been engaged in a long-running case with Sahara group over refund of more than Rs 24,000 crore (about $ five billion) collected by two Sahara companies from more than three crore investors through issue of certain bonds.
 
 Saharas were asked by the Supreme Court last year to deposit the money to Sebi for further refund to investors after verifying their genuineness and the market regulator recently initiated a process for the refund.
 
 However, Saharas have deposited only Rs 5,120 crore with Sebi and have claimed that more than Rs 20,000 crore they have already refunded directly to the bondholders. The case is scheduled for further hearing by the apex court tomorrow.
 
 Speaking at a venture capital conference here, Sebi chief said that the regulator's aim is to protect the interests of investors and focus on corporate governance.
 
 ""When some company, which was not even registered with Sebi, raised money from ordinary investors in the country, for example in West Bengal, people started blaming Sebi.
 
 ""It is not one company and there are multiple companies that raised money from large number of investors. The perception was that money is lost,"" Sinha said, while adding that Sebi always steps in to safeguard investors' interest.
 
 ""So, we are accountable, as the first agency which comes to anybody's mind is, if there is any issue about investor protection, that's Sebi. We have to be careful about that,"" he said.

The company currently derives a bulk of its Rs 21,000-crore turnover from manufacturing and selling jewellery to retailers in the local as well as export markets. 

 The company intends to increase its retail outlets to 125 from 73 stores currently in Karnataka by the end of April 2012 and a total of 550 stores across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala by the end of 2014. For this, it intends to raise Rs 2,500 crore through external commercial borrowing (ECB), Rs 2,000 crore through internal accruals and Rs 2,000 crore through supplier's credit. The proceeds from the ECB will be used to buy gold, said Mehta. 

 The company imports gold dore, or impure gold, from mines overseas and manufactures jewellery at its Bangalore headquarters. ""Since we are fully integrated, we will be able to cut down the supply chain and offer gold jewellery 10-20% cheaper than our rivals,"" claimed Mehta. 

 The company follows an associate model for its retail foray, refurbishing existing stores of jewellers who apply to become its associates and stocking it with its own inventory. The day-to-day cost of the establishment is to be borne by the associates but Rajesh Exports bears the advertising cost apart from providing inventory.

  Let us get your view on the refiners because I have read a couple of reports that seem to feel that really quite sceptical about the fact that the government will indeed do something which will really be meaningful in terms of giving a boost to bottom line for all of these companies technically how do they look?
  
  At the moment they are obviously with that bit of a sell off yesterday and the day before they are under pressure but it would appear to be short term pressure because all these companies are very much just a little bit below their highs especially Bharat Petroleum they are life time highs. 
  
  Now, they are not too many stocks in the market which are really there so given that the long term trend in these stocks are stable but one thing to remember about these stocks is they go up during market downtrends and they fall during uptrends and this is exactly what is happening again. Primarily related to the trend in crude oil price, crude oil tends to go up with the markets and these stocks tend to go down with crude oil so that's really what has been happening here.

 Tendulkar and Warne are in the US as captains of an inaugural all-star line-up of 28 cricket legends from across the world for the first ever 'Cricket All Stars' series in the US. 

 Tendulkar and Warne will visit the stock exchange to highlight the inaugural cricket series which will take place in New York, Houston and Los Angeles. They will ring the opening bell at 9:30m New York time that will mark the start of the trading day. 

 The historic tour marks the first time Tendulkar and Warne will play on US soil. 

 The 'Cricket All-Stars' kicks off on November 7 at Citi Field in New York City with a special opening ceremony prior to the match as well as other functions and galas. 

 The second match will be on November 11 in Houston and the final match in the series will be on November 14 in Los Angeles, followed by a special trophy presentation to the winning team. 

 In the past, several Indian dignitaries, including political leaders and businessmen, have rung the opening and closing bell at the stock exchange and at NASDAQ. 

 Given that cricket is not a popular sport in America, it is the first time that cricketers will ring the ceremonial bell at the stock exchange. 

 Through extensive promotions and media appearances, Tendulkar said the idea behind the series is not only to popularise the game in America but to globalise it as there is need to have more countries play the sport competitively in tournaments like the World Cup. 

 ""The reason for picking up a cricket bat again after retirement is to globalise cricket. That is a dream and vision Warne and I have. One day we would like the American (cricket) team also to participate in the World Cup. It would be a great moment. All cricketers have also been endorsing for having cricket in the Olympics.

Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-wants-bourses-to-provide-a-level-playing-field-for-hft-traders/articleshow/33577070.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi wants bourses to provide a level playing field for HFT traders,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi wants stock exchanges in India to provide a level playing field for traders who use high frequency trading (HFT) through co-location and those without the facility. 

 The debate over the use of HFT has resurfaced after the recent release of Michael Lewis’ book Flash Boys, which is critical of the system. The discussion within Sebi is that stock exchanges should implement its guidelines issued last year, which states there should be a two-queue system for orders coming from co-location and other mode. 

 Such an architecture will provide orders generated from a space not co-located a fair chance of execution and address concerns related to being crowded-out by orders placed from co-location, a Sebi official said. 

 Co-location is like proximity hosting, where the exchange hosts the subscriber’s server at its data centre near the master trading engine and helps in faster movement of data and execution of trades. Not all traders can use co-location as setting up the infrastructure involves huge costs. Both National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the BSE do not follow any separate queue system currently. 

 The two-queue system would ensure stockbrokers who are not co-located have a fair and equitable access to the stock exchange’s trading systems, said Sebi. The regulator had said distribution ratio of orders from terminals/servers that are not co-located to the orders from co-located servers may be kept at 1:1 and, in future, it may be reviewed based on the feedback from market participants. 

 ""Conceptually, I am not against such a system,"" said Rajesh Baheti, managing director of Mumbai-based Crosseas Capital, one of the largest domestic arbitrageurs using HFT. ""It should be seen if such technology is possible and the results should be measurable."" 

 Lewis argues in his book that the $23-trillion US stock market is rigged in favour of HFT traders, who prey on slower investors by getting early access to non-public information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the US is already probing potential criminal activity associated with HFT. 

 On April 4, US attorney general Eric Holder said the justice department is investigating whether HFT violates insider-trading laws. Many other brokers believe the debate over HFT versus non-HFT is a question of market integrity. ""Many private investors do not participate as their orders are executed at a slower speed during events or major news. They believe that markets are rigged against them,"" said a Delhi-based broker. 

 The NSE did not comment on the issue. The BSE said it will continue to implement all Sebi policies in earnest and currently it does not give any priority to HFT traders in terms of information or matching of orders. But then sources close to NSE say the exchange, too, does not allow order matching on priority basis to HFT traders and they get matched as and when they come. 

 As per the latest data on NSE, HFT constitutes 17.15 per cent of the overall trading volumes. HF proponents say Sebi’s suggestion cannot be implemented. ""People will stop co-locating,"" said Hirander Misra, CEO, Global Markets Exchange Group. 

 ""Co-location is mainly for time priority. It gives liquidity to markets with high number of passive orders. If you say orders that come first may not go first, then people will stop using it. Separate order queues will close down co-location.""

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: In the near term though, does it seem like there are any indications of the market getting overheated? Does it seem like the rally could pause - not because of us, but because of the global developments at play right now? 

 
Arindam Ghosh: India has a strong chance of getting de-coupled and the probability of that getting pronounced is going to be incrementally high, because of both domestic and global factors at play. 

 I can point out three domestic factors at this point. One is inflation, which is coming off at a trajectory much sharper than what it was originally estimated to be. Secondly, we are closer than earlier to turn in the monetary cycle. Lastly, growth is definitely showing steady signs of pickup. 

 Add to this the windfall of the global factor in terms of international crude prices, and India looks to be the second best market after US. 

 Hence, irrespective of what happens globally, we really do not anticipate any over-the-cliff kind of a situation. Nevertheless, even in an environment where growth has actually been slowing down, we have the Eurozone which is faltering and we have emerging markets which is battling a slowdown in growth and monetary tightening. 

 On the other hand, you have India, which is actually in a very sweet spot. India will keep on getting more than proportionate share of the allocation when it comes to global and regional allocations. Barring any geopolitical escalation - which is always a possibility - we feel that India, over the long term, definitely looks to be on the up.

 However in general, it is expected of this current government that they will improve the efficiencies of the PSU stocks and so there is a lot of positivity around PSU stocks at this point of time. 

 But at the same time, policy decisions are going to equally affect the private sector and I guess they will also benefit from the current government’s policies.

"Simplex Infrastructure: Healthy order book, smart execution to help beat slump blues",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/simplex-infrastructure-healthy-order-book-smart-execution-to-help-beat-slump-blues/articleshow/12155622.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Simplex Infrastructure: Healthy order book, smart execution to help beat slump blues","
  Kolkata-based Simplex Infrastructure was one of the few small-sized construction firms which did not participate in the recent rally in construction & infrastructure firms. This underperformance could be attributed to the lower margins reflected in the third quarter results of the company. 
  
  At a time when small- sized construction firms have reported a net profit margin of 4-5%, Simplex Infrastructure reported a net profit margin of 1.1% in the quarter ending December 2011. This is due to a foreign exchange loss of 3.3 crore and one-time start-up cost for a few projects. 
  
  Another reason for lower profits is high debt. At the end of September 2011, the company had a debt to equity ratio of 1.64. This is higher in comparison to its peers such as Unity Infra Projects and Pratibha Industries, which have a debt to equity ratio of 1.1 each. 
  
  As a result, a significant amount of the company's operating profits is used for servicing debt. In the December 2011 quarter, its interest expense was 42% to its operating profits. 
  
  In the coming quarters, a strong order book would help the company in allaying these concerns. The company has a healthy order book of 14,441 crore, which is nearly three times its FY11 revenues. 
  
  At a time when most construction companies are facing a dearth of new orders, Simplex Infrastructure has been able to secure nearly 4,162 crore worth of orders in the first nine months of this financial year. One of the main reasons for securing new orders is its execution capability. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Besides, the company's working capital days have also improved in the last few months. Its working capital days improved from 136 days in September 2011 to 120 days in December 2011 quarter, a reflection of the fact that the company has managed its working capital quite effectively in a high interest rate regime. 
  
  Also the fact that the company's order book is well-diversified, helps it weather any slowdown in one particular sector. Of the total order book of 14,441 crore, the company has an exposure of close to 27% to construction activities related to buildings and housing, followed by 26% in power, 11% in roads, and 14% in industrial sectors. On a trailing twelve months basis, the company is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 9.6.

The maximum Open Interest build-up is seen in 5300 Calls and 5200 Puts for January expiry, suggesting a tight trading range broadly for the market.There have not been enough additions in Calls on the downside strike of 5100, which gives some cushion to the fall. Also, decent a build-up in ITM 5100 and 5000 Puts suggests that long positions in index futures have been hedged for the downfall. However, activity in the Open Interest build-up of Calls and Puts on Monday, along with the increase in Volatility and the Discount of the Nifty futures to the spot, suggests that the market may see some more selling in trade on Wednesday.Technically, 5180 acts as a strong support which may be breached in the near term.

Top five things to watch out for in Reliance Industrie 40th AGM,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/top-five-things-to-watch-out-for-in-reliance-industries-40th-agm/articleshow/36749012.cms,m.economictimes.com,Top five things to watch out for in Reliance Industries' 40th AGM,"By Jagannadham Thunuguntla


	The oil & gas major Reliance Industries is scheduled to host its 40th Annual General Meeting on Wednesday. The Street awaits Mukesh Ambani's speech to know more about the future roadmap for KG-D6, cash utilisation on its balance sheet, any update on share gas etc. 


	Here is a list of top five things to watch out in RIL AGM: 


	The future roadmap for KG-D6, in the context of new government and gas pricing: 


	The government is likely to hike natural gas rates from July 1 after a new price formulation is approved by the Cabinet.  And the much benefit is going to be in the hands of Reliance.  At present, of the 165 discoveries under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) regime, only Reliance Industries' KG-D6 field and a small Niko Resources field are under production. However, in the KG-D6 field, production has been declining continuously over the past few years amidst several legal disputes, including one on production shortfall of 154 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd). The management may give a clear roadmap on the much awaited gas pricing issue which has been staging behind for long time.


	Roadmap for any national or international acquisitions including shale gas assets: 


	With the improvement of the global economy and the domestic economy, it is expected that many companies will go for deals. With declining production in the KG-D6, the company will probably focus on increasing stake in Shale gas through green field and brown field projects. Besides, the ongoing deals and acquisition, more acquisitions may be expected to see in the field of telecommunication 4 G service as this is a new concept in India.


	Future of 4G telecom business:
	
	In the days to come it seems that the pace of growth in 4G telecom business can be expected to gear up. As Reliance Jio is preparing a network for high-speed 4G, it has signed a tower-sharing deal with ATC India, in order to roll out its much-awaited high speed data and voice services faster and at a lower cost across India. However, Reliance Communications has signed three back-to-back deals worth Rs 17,200 crore with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio for sharing towers (Rs 12,000 crore), inter-city fibre (Rs 1,200 crore) and intra-city fibre (Rs 4,000 crore). Last month, Reliance Jio Managing Director has said that Reliance Jio will be offering 4G services through a combination of towers they are renting from these partners and those that they are constructing on their own. It apparently plans to construct around 25,000-30,000 towers on its own. It is much expected that management may give clear picture at AGM on this regard.


	Any reference regarding the media business expansion, in the context of ongoing open offer for Network 18:


	Recently RIL had announced that it would invest about Rs4,000 crore through Independent Media Trust, to acquire 78 per cent stake in NW18 and about 9 per cent stake in TV18 Broadcast. Moreover it has also announced that the open offer would begin on July 21 and close on August 4. As the RIL also intends to acquire up to 1.3 crore equity shares of Infomedia Press at Rs3 a share, so, it is expected that on 40th Annual General Meeting, the management may give clear roadmap regarding the media business expansion.
	 

	 

	The usage of cash on balance sheet: 


	As the company has strong balance sheet with the cash reserve of Rs 88190 cr, the company may pronounce the future capital expenditure plan such as reviving the production in KG-D6 basin, any special dividend or buy back.

"Vodafone starts preparatory work for IPO in India, expresses optimism about government",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/vodafone-starts-preparatory-work-for-ipo-in-india-expresses-optimism-about-government/articleshow/49366369.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Vodafone starts preparatory work for IPO in India, expresses optimism about government","NEW DELHI: The Vodafone Group has started ""preparatory work"" for an initial public offering of its Indian unit, although no dates have been set yet, the British telecom company's CEO said, expressing optimism about the emergence of a new India.
 
 Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao, however, argued against the government's proposal to make operators compensate users for call drops, saying such a practice is unheard of in other parts of the world.
 
 Speaking to the media, he said the Indian government needs to decide if it wants to follow a revenue maximisation policy from spectrum auctions or keep airwaves affordable to allow telcos to invest more in the long term, which will improve call quality and facilitate Digital India.
 
 Broadly though, Colao, who has been critical of government policies in the past, said he is witnessing a ""New India"" in which the government is making positive changes towards the ease of doing business.
 
 ""I also hear people say it's (change) not fast enough. I say fine, but it's also a big country,"" Colao said. ""Is it (New India) visible in every aspect of our business? No, it's not, but it's starting to be visible in enough places. If the pace continues, digitisation of the country will happen.""
 
 He pointed to recent decisions on allowing trading and sharing of telecom spectrum as well as the more accommodative stand on taxation as evidence that ""things are changing."" He added that Vodafone is open to sharing and trading of airwaves, which will help improve call services. ""India is clearly one of the five big pillars of Vodafone Group in the world,"" Colao said.
 
 Vodafone is India's second-largest telco with about 187 million subscribers and accounts for 10% of the group's revenue. Its annual capital expenditure of Rs 8,500 crore makes it the biggest foreign direct investor.
 
 Colao is on a four-day trip to India, acountry where Vodafone has faced a slew of tax cases. Almost all the cases have resulted in favourable judgments for the telco, the latest being a Rs 8,500 crore transfer pricing case. Its major Rs 20,000 crore tax dispute on its 2007 deal with Hutchison Whampoa, which facilitated its India entry, is under international arbitration and is progressing in a ""cordial"" way, Colao said. He also appreciated the government's decision in January not to appeal a high court verdict in late 2014, which ruled in favour of the company in a separate transfer pricing case.
 
 Vodafone has revived its IPO plans, which have been considered for several years now. ""I cannot give you a date for an IPO. We are positively inclined to it and we have started some preparatory work,"" Colao said. ""We haven't made a final decision because there are many factors that can influence one way or the other"" such as markets and oil prices.
 
 Vodafone, along with other telcos, have been in the crosshairs of the government on the issue over rising call drops. Colao said Vodafone is working with the government to resolve the issue, but disagreed with the regulator and the telecom department's proposal to force telcos to compensate subscribers for call drops, saying this doesn't happen anywhere in the world.
 
 ""Personally, it's not the right solution. Which operator would like to give bad services to its customer? Which leading operator would like to do that? We are sorting that out,"" Colao asked. He said call drops can't be resolved just by increasing investments because that's not really the cause. Solutions to call drops need to cover aspects such as more spectrum, more telecom towers, access to sites and right of way.
 
 Calling on the government to allocate more airwaves, Colao said India has maximised a lot of revenue out of spectrum auctions by offering low quantities of the natural resource. ""The difficult choice is how large the allocation of spectrum it can make and the second problem is also political choices in order to make spectrum affordable enough, then have a lot of investment following it,"" Colao said. ""Therefore, little bit of thinking of how to make available more spectrum with a longer term view is strategic,"" he said.
 
 He added that affordable bandwidth will allow telcos to invest more in technology, which will improve data speeds and quality of services, which will ultimately boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a Digital India. ""Vodafone is one the great digital partners of India. We are intrinsically a part of Digital India.""
 
 Vodafone believes the annual capex of Rs 8,500 crore is the right amount, which is the biggest by Vodafone in any market. The company plans to launch 4G services in the main data markets and circles and progressively expand.

Pramod Gubbi: The scope of improvement is quite large with PSU banks. I do not think anybody would disagree with that. It is just that the effort require, the political will required to resolve some of the issues there are also quite large in terms of scope.

 There have been talk, of course, but given the extent of the upside if at all things correct, you would not miss out on too much if you are late to join that party. So I would rather wait on the sidelines to see those initiatives so private sector banks are clearly remain in a better shape to play at this stage.

Indeed, markets had corrected to a point where stocks rose after the actual tapering. Will it be the same if Fed, now led by Bernanke’s successor Janet Yellen, finally decides to hike rates today? Opinions are divided. More than a hike, a lot would depend on the Fed commentary. Markets may stabilise after a brief fall if the language doesn’t suggest a string of future hikes; but the reaction would be stronger if the tone is hawkish — a possibility that most have ruled out. But if Fed keeps rates unchanged, there could be a very brief rally before traders and economists restart the guessing game. On Wednesday, Bloomberg calculation showed that there’s only 30 per cent probability of a rate hike.

 Most market participants had feared a rate hike by the US Fed would spark volatility in emerging markets and keep the RBI from cutting rates. However, RBI governor gave no hint as to what he is going to do in the upcoming policy meet due later in the month.
 
 Addressing bankers and industrialists at an event, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Friday said that ""we have to keep inflation low not just today but also in the future. Monetary policy will accommodate to the extent there is room"".
 
 The RBI governor further highlighted that the RBI awaits greater transmission of past policy actions.
 
 Industry experts still remain divided, though there is still room for the central bank given the fact that inflation has come down.
 
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in an interview with ET Now, said that we must learn to trust the Reserve Bank (RBI) on rate cut decision. The bank has a history of being a very professional institution which factors in all these concerns.
 
 ""Everybody would like a rate cut but the fact is that the authority to do it is the Reserve Bank and I am sure that they are conscious of the situation,"" he added.
 
 Wholesale Price index data (WPI) released earlier this week showed that deflationary trend continued for the 10th month in a row with inflation plunging to a historic low of (-)4.95 per cent in August. The Consumer price index (CPI) for the month of August came in at 3.66 percent, marginally lower than the July CPI which stood at 3.78 percent.
 
 In an interview with ET Now, Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairman, SBI, said she doubted there would be a rate cut by the RBI. However, she sees a case for a 25-bps cut.
 
 Despite the lowering of inflation, optimism levels about recovery in the economy have not rebounded. In fact, the growth data is being looked at cautiously with downside revisions to the growth projected at the beginning of the year.
 
 ""While the price indicators reflect a substantial moderation, it would be interesting to perceive the inflation dynamics once the favorable base effect wanes and full impact of deficit monsoon is visible, that is, after October 2015,"" said Arun Singh, Senior Economist, Dun & Bradstreet India.
 
 ""The factors which currently pose challenges to the growth dynamics are high non-performing and restructured loans, increase in corporate leverage, weak corporate sales, poor export demand and uncertainty over the US Fed rate hike,"" he added.
 
 Singh added that ""weak demand along with low inflation has provided more room to the RBI to further cut the policy rate in the upcoming policy meet"".
 
 We have collated a list of views from various experts as to what they expect from upcoming RBI meet on September 29:
 
 
Daljeet Singh Kohli, head of reseach at India Nivesh: 'rate cut by 25 bps'
 
 No action by US Fed opens up space for the RBI to cut rates at least by 25 bps on or before September 29, as the big risk, run-down on currency, is abated, while inflation data is very much in favour of rate cut. On the hopes of rate cut, we expect rate-sensitive stocks to rally in short term.
 
 
Nitasha Shankar, Vice President - Research, YES Securities: 'Rate cut would help sentiment'
 
 US FED has taken a decision to not raise interest rates, at present. Although there could be a momentary pause in the cautiousness seen in markets in the recent times, however uncertainty will continue till the next Fed meet, which will keep upside capped. As for the Indian markets, the next event that investors would be eyeing will be the RBI meet. A rate cut would help in reviving the positive sentiment.
 
 
India Ratings: 
 
 RBI is likely to cut rates by 25 bps in the upcoming meeting, which is scheduled towards the end of the month, irrespective of what the US Federal Reserve does, India Rating said in a report on Monday.
 
 If the Fed were to delay the normalisation process, which it did, the cushion available could be higher, though RBI may like to retain flexibility for future volatility. Ind-Ra's base case expectation is a 25-bps repo rate cut September 29.
 
 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Market Expert 
 
 Everybody wanted this Fed event to be over. The focus will now shift to RBI for a possible rate cut and 29th September is probably what everybody will be looking forward from here on, because that will be the next date which all of us will start tracking.

AIA share sale set to be World's second largest IPO of the year,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/aia-share-sale-set-to-be-worlds-second-largest-ipo-of-the-year/articleshow/6794398.cms,m.economictimes.com,AIA share sale set to be World's second largest IPO of the year,"
  HONG KONG: The Asian unit of troubled US insurer AIG looked set on Friday to record the world's second-largest initial public offering this year, in a monster share sale that could still top 20 bn US dollars. AIA said that it had raised 17.8 bn US dollars after pricing its shares at 19.68 Hong Kong dollars (2.53 US dollars) ahead of the insurer's debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange next week.
  
  Frenzied investor demand has already made the IPO Hong Kong's largest ever share sale while the total amount raised could rise if other options are exercised. Agricultural Bank of China in July raised a total of 22.1 bn dollars from its IPO, exceeding the previous world record set by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which raised 21.9 bn dollars in 2006.
  
  However, Agbank's IPO was split with it raising 12 bn dollars in Hong Kong and the rest in Shanghai. Shares in AIA's highly-anticipated offering were priced at almost 16 times forecast earnings this year, Dow Jones Newswires cited an unnamed source as saying.
  
  ""The IPO is a critical turning point for AIA and we are delighted that it has been so positively received by investors around the world,"" Mark Tucker, AIA's chief executive, said in a statement on Friday. On Sunday, AIA said it would initially offer 5.86 bn shares at between 18.38 and 19.68 Hong Kong dollars, adding that it could issue additional shares if it exercised a so-called greenshoe option.
  
  That may bring the total raised to around 20.5 bn dollars and leave AIG with a stake of just 32.9 percent in the firm. AIG, which is on the hook to repay US taxpayers after a government bailout in 2008, won approval last month for the sale.
  
  The US insurer was forced to look at publicly floating AIA in Hong Kong after the collapse in June of a proposed 35.5-bn US dollar sale to the British insurer Prudential.
  
  AIA's reach across 15 Asian countries and its healthy balance sheet explained the strong investor demand, said Francis Lun, general manager of Hong Kong's Fulbright Securities. The firm booked a net profit of 1.75 bn US dollars in 2009.
  
  ""The listing should do well because of the strong investor demand (for AIA shares),"" Lun told AFP, adding that ""AIA is a good company and insurance is always a very strong cash flow business."" But Patricia Cheng, an analyst at Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA, questioned AIA's growth potential despite the firm's well-known brand, noting that it was losing market share in some countries.
  
  ""Investors are in Asia for growth. Today?s AIA unfortunately doesn?t measure up too well,"" she wrote in a report this month. ""(AIA's) influence has been declining across the board. It?s already lost the top positions in China (among foreign operations), Hong Kong and Singapore.""
  
  Major investors in the AIA sale include the Kuwait Investment Authority, the oil-rich Gulf emirate's sovereign wealth fund, and a number of Hong Kong tycoons.
  
  Chinese sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp is also among the buyers, according to reports. AIA traces its roots in Asia back more than 90 years and was the largest foreign life insurer in China in 2009 based on life insurance premiums.

ET Now: Is Europe turning out to be exciting for specially the auto component exporters there?
 
 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay: It has been exciting for quite some time look at the Indian auto component guys most of them had taken the opportunity of the slowdown in European economy and gone and acquired really excellent auto component manufacturing facilities in Europe that has given them a significant toehold vis-à-vis the European auto mobile manufacturers.
 
 Motherson Sumi you were talking about, that is an excellent case in point. There are many other companies which have done the same so I have no hesitation in saying that the globalisation of the Indian auto component industry predominantly happened on the back of the last European recession which actually kicked off in 2007-2008 and the globalisation of Indian auto component industry is thanks to what happened in Europe in 2007-2008. Having said that the opportunities in US also insignificant and some of these guys are looking at acquisition, opportunities in US.
 
 Indian auto component industry is in a very good position, we have a distinct cost advantage, we have technology skill sets which is being developed in India as well so overall it is a good position as far as auto component companies are concerned but you have to be selective, it does not mean that you can just close your eyes and buy any auto component company you have to carefully see. We know what happened recently with Amtek Auto so investors are advised caution, they should examine the company before they jump.

Ashwani Gujral: There was a fear when the tapering was announced; that fear is happening now as well. The Bank Nifty is refusing to participate in this rally. You are not getting that momentum which takes the Nifty up 120 points. That is going to create a problem moving forward. 

 Yes, for the next few days, oil and tech space can take you higher. However, if banks refused to participate, then this rally has troubles even in the next 40 points. 

 That is one reason we have decided not to carry longs on the Nifty which we were from today morning because we need participation of banks.

ET Now: Sticking to midcap IT, is there anything you think that still has a large portion of the move left in it? 

 
Neeraj Deewan: There might be couple of stocks here and there in IT where you can still get those large moves but actually speaking the broader basket, we are not very bullish on IT now because we have seen the large cap stocks doing very well. It came to second tier, it came to the third tier also which has started contributing as far as IT is concerned. 

 Like Mphasis where the non-HP business is also improving and there are talks in the market of HP looking at maybe selling some stake also so there can be some movement which can happen in couple of stocks here and there but as larger basket, the real money that we made in IT has already been made.
 
 You need to see a phase of consolidation, some correction and then maybe you can again take a case of IT though for a longer term IT will still continue doing well with improvment in US, with our rupee staying above 60 so that play is still there but at the current level we are bullish on entering IT.

Fed won't impact Indian bourses that much, say experts","NEW DELHI: While most investors across emerging markets are losing sleep over a possible US Federal Reserve rate hike, Dalal Street seems to be on some ease, say experts.  Their assessment: A knee-jerk reaction, but that would be all. Most analysts do not see a breakdown in the index. Going by the option data too, market participants do not see Nifty50 slipping below 7,500.  There is very strong support at 7,500 strike where the OI concentration stands at 46.55 lakh contracts, according to the data collected on December 3.  For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets  ""Going by incremental data points received over the past one month, the expected downside in the event of a Fed rate hike (60% probability of a rate hike) appears to be diminishing and the recent low of 7,700 on Nifty, in our view, is the near term floor for Indian equity market,"" said Ravi Sundar Muthukrishnan, Senior Vice President, Co-Head, Research, ICICI Securities Ltd.  The domestic equity market looks more prepared, and the nervousness that was back in the July-August period seems to be abating. India continued to be among underperforming equity markets for the month of November (-1.6% as against an average of flat returns across global equity markets) due to sustained FII selling (- USD 1 bn).  ""Historically, sustained selling by FII's has resulted in a sharp fall in Indian equities, which seems to have abated in the recent past. One of the key supports for the Indian markets has been DIIs and that too MFs despite of high volatility,"" added Muthukrishnan.    One possible reason highlighted by experts was that fact that US Federal Reserve planned to hike rates back in the July-August period. The timelines were then pushed to December, which gave investors enough time to investors to structure their portfolio.  A possible rate hike will make emerging markets (EMs), including India, less attractive, but will make US treasuries more attractive. If US Fed hike rate happens, then such a move will raise the cost to borrowing in dollar terms. The dollar will gain strength which will weigh on emerging market currencies, say experts.  ""The US Fed rate hike has been well anticipated. I know that the timing was uncertain. We began 2015 with a consensus somewhere around mid-year 2015 for a rate hike, that moved towards the autumn and the view has now settled to a December date,"" said Atsi Sheth, Moody's Investors Service.  ""While the timing has moved, the rate in near future is something that the markets have already anticipated quite well, and we anticipate that there will be maybe a little bit more turbulence when an announcement is made, but we should not see the kind of severe drops in currencies, because markets will have absorbed most of the impact of the rate hike,"" she added.  With US Fed indicating a trajectory of higher interest rates, there could be capital outflows from the EM economies as the rate differential reduces, say experts. USD/INR is expected to see some depreciation pressure as the Fed raises interest rates-in line with other Asian currencies.  ""India was more vulnerable to Fed rate hike back in 2013, because its current account deficit was much higher. It had larger external financing needs. As that deficit has narrowed, the market, in fact, this year the Indian rupee has performed relatively well compared to some of its Asian peers,"" said Sheth.  Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen hinted at a possible US rate hike later this month when the central bank meets for its 2-day meet starting December 15. But, clarity is something which market participants across the globe are looking at.  ""We think in the near term this sort of subdued performance is expected to continue, because we have a major event happening around the 15th and 16th of this month. Till such time as there is more clarity on which direction the interest rates are headed in United States, investors are unlikely to tale large positions on any market and India would not be an exception to it,"" said Nitasha Shankar, HoR, Yes Securities.  Significant decline in the markets due to large FII selling has been used as a strong buying opportunity by DII's and other retail investors.  ""If you are looking at a two- to three-year perspective, India is fundamentally in a very good position. Ideally, investors should use these kind of dips to invest for a long term but for near term, probably this performance would continue so one could just look at it from that perspective,"" she added.  One of the reasons for the outperformance could be the fact that India is relatively better placed amongst emerging markets (EMs). The growth seems to be coming back, and earnings are likely to bounce back from next few quarter.  Most of the macros such as current account deficit, and fiscal deficit are not at alarming levels unlike in 2013. So, we have some cushion to absorb external shocks, say experts.  ""India's macro fundamentals remain a huge positive given a fall in the commodity prices including oil prices. Lower crude oil and commodity prices are leading to significant improvement in India's micro economic position in terms of fiscal deficit and current account deficit,"" said Sanjay Dongre, EVP & Fund manager, UTI MF.  ""Earnings growth is expected to be over 15% in FY17 and in FY18 as higher expenditure by Govt coupled with lower interest rates may lead to higher GDP growth in the economy. As the India's fundamental standout among emerging markets, foreign inflows are likely to resume post the rate hike by Fed,"" he added."
Canada-based Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide sold to a group of strategic financial investors,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/canada-based-aditya-birla-minacs-worldwide-sold-to-a-group-of-strategic-financial-investors/articleshow/29616989.cms,m.economictimes.com,Canada-based Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide sold to a group of strategic financial investors,"MUMBAI: Aditya Birla group has sold its Canada-based business and technology outsourcing firm Aditya Birla Minacs Worldwide to a group of strategic financial investors, led by Capital Square Partners, owned by entrepreneur-turned-investors Sanjay Chakrabarty and Aparup Sengupta, and CX Partners.
 
 The deal was consummated at a valuation of Rs 1,500-1,600 crore. At the time of going to press, the board of Aditya Birla Nuvo, the parent company for Minacs, had cleared the proposal for stake sale.
 
 While Sanjay Chakrabarty was the founder and director of MobiApps, private equity fund CX Partners is managed by former head of Citi group’s private equity business Ajay Relan.
 
 The $40-billion telecom-to-retail group has decided to exit from the IT and ITeS business as Minacs is yet to become a dominant player in its core businesses.
 
 Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had earlier told ET that the group companies should be among the top three players in their respective fields.
 
 Minacs, which employs 21,000 people across 35 locations in the world, is the country’s sixth-largest BPO firm, according to rankings compiled by Nasscom.
 
 
  
 “One of the most powerful sources of value creation at the ABG group is its capital allocation review process. The decision to pull capital out of BPO is the application of the same strategic lens. The capital will get reallocated to businesses with superior strategic position,” said Rajeev Gupta, M&A rainmaker and founder of advisory firm Arpwood Capital.
 
 The business conglomerate entered the IT industry in 2001 by acquiring Bangalore-based PSI Data Systems, cofounded by Rediff promoter Ajit Balakrishnan. The group then took over BPO firm Transworks owned by IITians Rizwan Koita and Jagdish Moorjani in 2007.
 
 This was followed by the acquisition of Canadian firm Minacs. Minacs and Transworks later merged its operations to create Aditya Birla Minacs.

  NEW DELHI: Regretting that CIL's employees could not benefit from the company's mega-IPO due to trade unions' opposition to disinvestment, the Coal Ministry today said it can still reconsider the offer to allot up to 2 per cent shares to them on a preferential basis.
  
  The trade unions had boycotted the divestment of the government's stake in Coal India Limited and had asked employees to abstain from participating in the issue.
  
  The government had reserved 10 per cent of the total shares on sale for CIL employees and had offered a discount of 5 per cent to workers on the issue price of Rs 245 per share.
  
  ""If workers are ready, we can make allotment of up to 2 per cent shares to them on a preferential basis at the same price,"" Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal told PTI in an interview.
  
  The majority of the 3.98 lakh strong workforce did not bid for shares of the world's largest coal producer when the government offloaded a 10 per cent stake in CIL in October, 2010, garnering a whopping Rs 15,200 crore.
  
  Union leaders had called a strike on the first day of the share offer in October, 2010, and asked workers to abstain from bidding for it.
  
  Out of the 63.16 crore shares on offer, 10 per cent of which were reserved for its employees, only 10 per cent of the reserved shares were bid for by employees as the trade unions were protesting the share sale and had advised workers to stay away from the public offer.
  
  The small investors got good listing gains as they were allotted shares at Rs 232.75 a share after a discount of 5 per cent to the final issue price of Rs 245. However, the majority of the employees failed to cash in on the opportunity due to opposition from unions.
  
  ""Had the employees bought shares then, they could have been reaping rich dividends now,"" Jaiswal said regretting the opposition by the unions. ""But if they agree, we can still consider it,"" he added.
  
  A handful of employees who have the shares today have seen the price appreciate by about Rs 70 apiece from what they bought them for, as CIL's shares are hovering at around Rs 300 per share at present.
  
  CIL's IPO was a grand success and Jaiswal earlier had termed Coal India as ""Gold India.""
  
  The blockbuster issue was kicked-off after the Durga Puja festival and the world's biggest coal producer made its debut on the stock exchanges on November 4 -- a day before Diwali -- joining the club of the top-five most valued companies by market cap.
  
  The IPO got an overwhelming response from all investors and was oversubscribed 15.17 times, translating into total demand of Rs 2.3 lakh crore for the 63.16 crore shares on offer.

Mitesh Thacker: Reversals do happen and Tuesday appeared to be one of the days when the immediate or the short-term trend on the intraday charts got disturbed, possibly reversed.
 
 Concerns over Bank Nifty actually suggest that there could be more downside on Nifty. The banking index could head slightly lower. I am slightly bearish and expect 18,500 on the index would be the minimum target from here on. I am also prepared to look at 18,250 on the index on the downside. This suggests that Nifty might have slightly deeper correction than what we initially estimated it to be.
 
 The 50-pack index is close to its support level of 8,530. That said, in case we start breaking below that level, 8,450-8,420 on the downside could be easily revisited. That means there could be another 100-point cut. Most importantly, you might not get an uptrend immediately after that. We might have some kind of choppiness, more of a consolidative movement, before the index starts going up.
 
 So, I would be slightly bearish; we have taken some short positions on the banking side, on the banking index and individual banking names. Possibly, IT is the only hiding space. It is the only space where you would be comfortable holding aggressive long positions.

 Automated or algorithmic trading is a system for trading through a programmed software that can make around 800 transactions per second. The software-helped trading was allowed by Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 2005. 

 Besides SEBI and Finance Ministry, Justice Rajiv Shakdher has also issued notices to Reserve Bank of India, BSE and NSE on the plea alleging algorithmic trading put small investors at a disadvantage in comparison to big brokers and FIIs. 

 The court, which was hearing the plea of a group of retail investors 'Intermediaries and Investor Welfare Association', has fixed the matter for hearing on January 29. 

 The Association, in its plea, alleged algorithm trading system ""discriminates between rich and influential brokers and common investors/ retail investors and creates inequality and finally casts a deceptive data to common investors and retail investors while trading in shares and securities on online trading platforms of BSE and NSE"". 

 It also alleged that SEBI and Finance Ministry have been ""silent spectators"" on the issue and ""not bothering to check the fallout"" of algorithmic trading. 

 It said algorithmic trading ""creates unfair advantage"" to members who use the software against ordinary investors. 

 The algorithmic trading, which is faster, gives an edge to big investors in selling and purchasing shares and hence, this is discriminatory, the plea said.

 The stocks market came under selling pressure this week due to profit booking at higher levels. A set of good corporate quarterly numbers was discounted quickly. Stocks of companies that reported numbers in line or above estimates maintained status quo in prices, but companies whose Q2 numbers were below expectations got hammered. 

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have slowed down their buying spree and have gone into a wait and watch mode, awaiting the Bihar poll results. The market will remain subdued till the first week of November. 

 
Events of the week:  

 The US Federal Reserve in its bimonthly meeting for the first time gave a reasonable indication that US interest rates are likely to increase before the yearend, causing a flurry in global financial markets. 

 Domestic stock exchanges this week revised the contract value to minimum Rs 5 lakh in the derivatives segment, potentially impacting the liquidity in market. 

 The IPO of IndiGo although got over-subscribed six times, the retail investors quota went partially unsubscribed, indicating that market sentiments are bearish for the short term. At the same time, it also clearly showed that a huge bull market wrapped by frenzied activities of retail investors is yet to come. 

 
Technical outlook:  

 The Nifty50 has moved into profit-taking mode after rising 10 per cent since last month. The 8,100-8,000 levels are crucial for Nifty50 for medium-term strength. However, a close below 8,000 would indicate a reversal of the medium-term uptrend, which may potentially correct the entire rally since the beginning of September. 

 If the trend weakens and key levels are breached than Nifty50 can go down all the way to 7,800 level. The probability of continued weakness is high as the market is awaiting the important outcome of Bihar elections. 

 
Expectations for the coming week: 

 The mood of the market should remain mildly bearish with bouts of selling in stocks of companies that have reported earnings below expectations. Foreign investors have started hedging their long positions and have shifted to a wait-and-watch mode. 

 Corporate results have been good so far with fewer negative surprises, although majority of them have managed to keep the past momentum but the acceleration was clearly missing. The market can go into sideways consolidation with a negative bias for want of fresh triggers. 

 The market will most likely wait for Bihar election results before any substantial move. Nifty50 ended the week down by 2.70 per cent to close at 8,065.80.

This even as total rainfall so far this season is 10% above normal.“The steady progress of monsoon has already resulted in many commodities coming off their highs but we are still keeping a watch on the market,” Ramesh Abhishek, chairman, FMC told ET. 

 Chana, castorseed, coriander and jeera have witnessed significant volatility in recent times, especially after fears of a deficient monsoon cropped up. To tackle ‘abnormal’ volatility, exchanges at FMC’s instance have advanced the delivery period in the likes of castor, chana and coriander and even introduced additional margins on longs and shorts. As a result of these regulatory actions, entities attempting to squeeze sellers by cornering stocks in the physical markets and simultaneously mounting bullish bets in the futures market were forced out of the market. This reduced excessive volatility in counters like castor which saw historic delivery worth Rs 948 crore in the January contract on NCDEX. 

 So far 29,369 tonnes of castor have been delivered in the June contract that expires on June 19, 8500 tonnes in chana and 100 tonnes in coriander. The FMC this month advanced the delivery period in chana and coriander from June 11 to June 4 which resulted in those trying to manipulate the counters moving out of the market at the risk of being forced to take delivery a broker said. Nine of the ten top clients were net long castor on Thursday, the same being the case in chana, NCDEX data shows.

Government to review 'Call & Put Option' rules that hit DoCoMo exit plan,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/government-to-review-call-put-option-rules-that-hit-docomo-exit-plan/articleshow/48151524.cms,m.economictimes.com,Government to review 'Call & Put Option' rules that hit DoCoMo exit plan,"NEW DELHI: The government is set to review rules that led to the rejection of NTT DoCoMo’s proposal to sell shares to Tata Sons at a pre-agreed price to exit their joint venture five months ago. The move is aimed at attracting bigger private equity and venture capital investment in the booming ecommerce sector and other emerging areas.
 
 The finance ministry is looking at allowing greater pricing flexibility for securities with an exit valuation clause at a rate set beforehand, technically known as a ‘call and put option.’ “There are issues with pricing of quasi-equity instruments... We are examining the norms,” a senior government official aware of the development told ET, confirming that the regulations were being reviewed.
 
 The ‘call and put option’ rules have undergone frequent changes, creating policy confusion and delays that undermine business sentiment, according to experts.
 
 It was this year’s finance Act that shifted control on equity capital flows to the finance ministry from the Reserve Bank of India, giving the government power to review these rules. However, the government has to administer these in consultation with the central bank.
 
 
 
TATA-DOCOMO CASE
 
 In January, the RBI had suggested allowing the transfer of shares by a nonresident investor at a price higher than their fair value in view of the Indian partner's contractual commitments in the Tata-DoCoMo case. The policy allowed for a fair valuation different from the exit valuation agreed between the two investors in the telecom venture. The RBI’s view was that the contractual agreement should be honoured and pitched for a change in policy. The finance ministry, wary of changing the existing policy in one instance, asked RBI to take a view on the case in line with the central bank's own guidelines. It subsequently took over jurisdiction of the policy in the February budget.
 
 
CASE FOR MORE FELXIBILITY
 
 The Narendra Modi-led government, which has launched the Make in India initiative among others to boost economic activity, is keen to attract foreign capital to spur the country's manufacturing sector.
 
 Last week, the union cabinet cleared a policy to allow fungibility of all forms of foreign capital within sectoral caps as part of its drive to make the country a more attractive destination for overseas investors. The review of the ‘call and put option’ pricing rules are part of the government's push to iron out difficulties they posed for investment of risk capital in emerging areas. The central bank had also written to the finance ministry on the issue of pricing norms governing exits and the need to re-examine the existing policy. Industry has sought changes as well. “The pricing norms should facilitate the execution of the real commercial understanding between the parties, especially concerning the put/call option pricing for the deal, irrespective of the fair market valuation of the shares,” said Punit Shah, partner, Dhruva Advisors.
 
 
TROUBLED PAST
 
 A ‘call’ option allows the holder to buy shares in an entity at an agreed price, while a ‘put’ option allows an investor to sell. Though popular, these instruments were not looked upon with too much favour by the RBI as it was worried that they would lead to foreign debt coming in disguised as equity. Put options, which give special rights to foreign investors to sell back equity if certain conditions such as timely listing are not fulfilled by Indian company, were seen largely as facilitating debt flows that would go out after a certain period.
 
 In 2011, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), taking its cue from the RBI, had even banned these instruments but soon retracted the policy measure over fears it could slow down foreign investment. In 2013 the RBI, finance ministry, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and DIPP reached an understanding on these instruments and agreed to allow them with a one-year lock-in period after adhering to pricing norms.
 
 In its rules, the RBI said exits could not be at a price higher than that arrived at on the basis of return on equity, a change from the earlier norm based on the discounted cash flow method it had specified. After representations against this condition, in July 2014, the RBI said any internationally recognised pricing methodology would be accepted.
 
 The RBI's views in the case of Tata NTT DoCoMo were thus seen as a complete reversal of its earlier stance against such instruments.
 
 
Let them plan their exit 

 The rules for pricing of ‘call and put option’ have rarely been objective, informed more often than not by the fear of debt entering in the guise of equity. Such fears do not sit well with India’s attempts to bring private equity and venture capital to fund avalanche of ideas by the internet generation. And India’s external account is no longer vulnerable to a few billion dollars flowing out. Investors putting up risk money to funds innovation need to be commensurately rewarded. Simpler rules are called for to govern how companies provide exit to foreign investors. Within a broad framework this needs to be left to the companies.

The firm has also announced elevation of two of its directors, Ritesh Banglani and Rahul Chowdhri, as partners at the venture fund. 

 Singh had set up Helion in 2006 along with Ashish Gupta, Sanjeev Aggarwal and Rahul Chandra. While Gupta and Aggarwal are at the level of senior MD, Chandra is an MD at the venture capital firm which manages $600 million across funds. Singh will stay with Helion till March 2016 and effect a smooth transition. 

 ""This comes at a time when the fund has considerably increased the focus on technology investing,"" said the statement from Helion. 

 Former co-head of venture capital at Carlyle in India, Singh primarily focused on consumer sector investments at Helion Venture. He serves on boards of Fashionara, HummingBird, YLG Salons, Qwikcilver, Mast Kalandar, Yepme, Attano and LifeCell. 

 In his previous stints before venture capital, Singh worked as marketing head for Intel South Asia before which he was at Hindustan Unilever for a decade in functions like sales, marketing and product innovation. 

 Singh’s move coincides with Helion promoting two of its relatively younger team members. Chowdhri, former Microsoft executive, has been associated with Helion since inception and worked on investments like salon chain YLG and online test prep startup Toppr. Bangalani joined in 2010 from IDG Ventures and has worked on investments like cab aggregator TaxiForSure and realty classifieds portal Housing. 

 Helion Ventures, which has offices in Delhi and Bangalore, has been one of the most active investors in Indian startups over the last 7-8 years. Some of the firms well known investments include online travel portal MakeMyTrip and bus ticketing website RedBus, both of which it has exited.

Here why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/heres-why-devi-shetty-of-narayana-health-is-looking-to-hit-dalal-street/articleshow/48751746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Here's why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,"One afternoon last month, Dr Devi Shetty, who usually speaks to journalists as a philosopher would to an acolyte, sat in his gleaming office in the Narayana Health (NH) campus looking rather uneasy.

“According to Sebi rules, my lawyers say I’m not supposed to talk about future plans or financials,” he said, the words not sitting as comfortably on his tongue as cryoprecipitate just had. He sat back self-consciously. “But I can talk about healthcare in general, or maybe not... I don’t know, let’s see.”

It’s the most inarticulate anyone might have seen the good doctor. The reason for this unusual reticence is that NH is planning to launch a public issue soon. The multispecialty hospital chain, valued at an estimated Rs 5,000 crore and currently financed by investors CDC and JP Morgan, hopes to raise Rs 1,200-1,500 crore from the market.

So, although Shetty had agreed to a conversation at this pivotal moment, it called for a certain guardedness and occasional disclaimers. The IPO his biggest expansion plan yet was like a flashing billboard we were desperately trying not to look at.

Dr Shetty was in loose blue scrubs, a surgical mask dangling at his neck. His hands were pink with just-washed germlessness and he exuded the distracted calm of surgeons. He had a bypass in a couple of hours. “Do you mind if I ate lunch while we talked?” Out came a steel lunch carrier from home: rotis, vegetables, curd and mangoes but he kept going for the Mangalorean fish fry.

As he ate, he evoked the elusive dream of shedding all administrative responsibilities to simply be a cardiac surgeon. “I had to set up a whole hospital chain to be able to come back to doing the work I love, the way I want to do it,” he said laughing and chewing.

“That’s the magic and pain of entrepreneurship.” But an IPO and public listing will add several responsibilities that will inevitably fight for attention with cardiac surgery, his first love. It will also test Shetty’s ability to balance his social agenda — affordable surgeries for the poor — with investors’ expectations of reasonable returns.

Why an IPO NH treats more than 2 lakh in-patients and around 15 lakh out-patients annually, most of them from rural and underprivileged backgrounds. This was Shetty’s vision when he established NH, then Narayana Hrudayalaya, in the year 2000 to create a space for accessible, affordable healthcare.

Still, many of his anecdotes betrayed a restiveness. Yes, NH was the world’s largest low-cost hospital. “But did you know that India needs 20 lakh heart surgeries a year, but is capable of doing only around 1.2 lakh?”

“Mothers ask how much a surgery for their child will cost. I quote an amount. If they don’t have that much, they won’t get the operation. That’s what I do – that’s what all Indian doctors do – every day: put a price on a child’s life,” he said. The IPO will help NH build more hospitals to do more such surgeries cheaper.

Shetty’s son and senior vice-president Viren Shetty puts it pithily: “The IPO will enable us to be more us.” But the IPO will also bring the added responsibility of earning reasonable financial returns for shareholders.

Being a publicly listed company will open the low-cost hospital to the cycle of quarterly results and shareholder expectations and financial pressures that might compete with Shetty’s social goals.

Shetty himself was uncomfortable with it in the past. In a speech in June 2012, he had explained why his family candidly.


	 


“We are in business because we want to help the underprivileged and the cost of healthcare to come down. For that, I need the freedom.” At that time, his eccentric enterprise was funded by private investors JP Morgan and AIG, from whom they raised `200 crore each. In January 2015, UK-based CDC invested Rs 300 crore.

Then, Shetty kept his freedom and his private investors through standardisation and scale — investor speak for rationalising expenses and treating large numbers of poor people with the quality they deserve.

Shetty’s famously soft voice searched for a new phrase for his frequently quoted goal of ‘Walmartising’ healthcare, which he is now weary of. “Size for social impact, size for sustainability,” he finally said.

NH pursues economies of scale with a vengeance: it performs among the world’s largest number of heart surgeries, aggressively reduces costs through centralised purchases of supplies and innovates processes from billing to intensive care. NH does this in its 31 hospitals in 19 cities in India, and one in the Cayman Islands off the coast of the USA.

Walking through any NH campus is like seeing the wide gap between a government and private multi-specialty hospital close. Two floors below Shetty’s quiet office in the Bengaluru campus, the emergency ward teems with patients, nurses holding IVs, and doctors running soundlessly through hallways. A reed thin woman from Manipur sits under a tree near the cancer centre, breastfeeding her daughter — her husband was having surgery later that day.

It would cost her Rs 80,000, half of how much other private Indian hospitals charged. Another elderly woman from a village in Belgaum said her son was recovering from a bypass, paid in full by the microhealth-insurance scheme NH had pioneered for poor cooperative farmers in 2003 with the Karnataka government.

The Bengaluru hospital performs 49 surgeries a day, using specialists, high volume and technology to drastically reduce the time and cost of treatments. “How do we stay low-cost?” asked Shetty. “Because we’re big. Because we’re big, we can roll out the innovation across the hospitals. We can dictate terms in our purchases, we can maximise the use of expensive clinical equipment.”

While most hospitals use their infrastructure for around 8 hours, NH claims to use it for 12-14 hours a day. The average number of CT scans per machine in India is a maximum seven while in NH, Shetty said it is about 30. Since NH implants the largest number of heart valves in the world, valve manufacturing companies can sell their products at a lower cost to the hospital.

NH’s revenue in the latest available data for 2013-14 was Rs 1,072.68 crore, roughly a fifth of the biggest healthcare player Apollo’s and fourth of Fortis’. In the five years leading up to March 2014, however, NH’s income grew at a rate of 35%, ahead of Apollo and Fortis that grew at 18.7% and 29% respectively in the same period.

Volumes, cost cuts and tiered pricing have enabled NH to manage a net profit growth rate of 3.5% in the last five years kept a majority stake in the company. “We are eccentric people,” he had said (see Narayana Health vs...). “We make only a small margin compared to other big hospitals, but we are staying afloat treating a majority of poor patients for half the price,” said Shetty.

It’s All for the Mission A doctor from Manipal Hospital called NH “a temple for Devi Shetty”. Dozens of patients waited outside Shetty’s Bengaluru office, and an elderly man treated by NH’s senior oncologist used the word “darshan” when he said he wanted to catch a glimpse of Shetty before returning to his village. In Shetty’s defence, Vasuki, who has worked with Shetty for more than a decade, puts it down to “gratitude”.


	 


A few of Shetty’s detractors imply that it is the personal charm, not the hospital’s model that has opened doors for NH and smoothened expansion. In a blog post on June 9, 2012, Mumbai-based Dr Aniruddha Malpani, a popular infertility specialist, disparaged Shetty as “healthcare’s blue-eyed boy… unlikely to ever be critically analysed”. He also writes that Shetty has “political clout”.

Indeed, the doctor is friendly with Karnataka’s senior Congress leaders, the most well-known relationship being that with SM Krishna, who was chief minister when NH opened its first hospital off Bengaluru and set up the micro-health insurance scheme with the Karnataka government.

NH has also provided free primary health services since 2005 in 15 blocks of Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli and Amethi, constituencies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. In 2012 in Ahmedabad, the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi provided land for and inaugurated NH’s multispecialty hospital.

Now, Shetty continues to meet prime minister Modi as the secretary of the Association of Health Providers India. The connections give NH access to cheap land, trimming a large component of building a hospital.

It has helped NH grow not only in Karnataka and Gujarat, but also Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Assam.

Public-private partnerships like microhealth insurance and low-cost care centres also help displace the cost by getting the state, instead of the patient or NH, to foot part of the bill. While the harshest critics imply favouritism, no one suggests foul play.

Shetty’s healthcare visionary persona also seems to attract young, passionate healthcare professionals to the hospital. Like Dr Arvind Ranganathan in the first floor cardiac ICU, who is setting up iKare, a point-of-care app created by NH and IT Services firm Cognizant to centrally record and monitor patient vitals.

Or the Bengali-speaking young office manager Rajeev Yadav, who helped When Dr Ranganathan spoke of coming to NH after spending years in the US with healthcare startups, and Yadav of growing up poor in Kolkata wondering if he could ever afford to do social work, they glowed with the same sense of purpose.

Both seemed to believe Shetty had picked them personally for the job. Undeniably, Shetty’s surgical-outfit wearing, kindly, always accessible image has swayed private investors, suppliers, governments and healthcare professionals to back his unconventional ideas.

The public shareholder is the new frontier. The global praise for NH’s business model, and its ever-expanding existence has encouraged many small healthcare ventures across the country to scale up.

Low-cost care, smarter diagnosis, and India-proof medical technology are now funded by a growing cluster of impact investors – those who invest in companies with social goals. “In the last 10 years, the availability for funding in healthcare has exploded, and many are not charitybased, but for-profit models,” said Ashwin Naik, founder of Vaatsalya Healthcare, which sets up low-cost hospitals in small towns.

A PwC report said the average investment size by private equity funds in healthcare had increased from US$5-15 million to US$ 20-30 million, most of it in diagnostic centres and hospital chains. It is significant why NH chose an IPO at this juncture.

“The immediate reasons are that Narayana’s current investors are looking for an exit,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Dr Shetty’s friend, co-promoter, neighbour and Biocon founder, who runs the cancer centre in NH. “Some of the capital raised will be used to pay off debts to them. The rest will help Devi’s model reach even more people.”

Viren described it as a moment to tackle “the new problem of scale”. “We have solved the problem of cost. Now it’s about more land, more buildings, more technology, more doctors, more patients.” Today, NH has 6655 beds in all, but Shetty has always said his dream was 30,000 beds by 2020.

“To achieve that kind of size, you can’t but go to the market,” Shaw said. Size can be the reason for the IPO, but could the IPO shake the social-commercial balance of NH? Public investors might demand a greater returns, challenging NH’s working equation of social good and financial returns.

In recent years, for instance, the company has not paid any dividends, even if, with a majority stake, Shetty’s family would have stood to gain the most. It is a testament to the model’s intention of funnelling all gains into the social goal, but such a decision might not be as easy when public shareholders are involved.

Roopa Kudva, managing director of impact investor Omidyar Network, disagrees. Financial pressures are “constructive” for social businesses, said Kudva, also the former MD and CEO of ratings agency Crisil. “From businesses with social goals, investors would expect discipline, not unreasonable profit.”

Amit Bhatia, CEO of Impact Investors Council believes the NH IPO will be “a path-breaking one”, providing evidence that “businesses can do good and still be responsible in terms of economics.”

Viren Shetty argues that the vision was never constrained by having forprofit investors in the past, and the challenges with going public could be no less than before. “NH has never been flush with profits. Investors, private or public, know what we stand for when they put their money in it,” he says.

The senior Shetty is less direct. A few times in the interview, he asked this one question, in different ways: “Who says a for-profit hospital cannot achieve social impact, and do it for 20, 30, 40 years?”

Now he has to convince investors.

"HUL needs to up the game to sustain growth, emerge favourite among investors",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hul-needs-to-up-the-game-to-sustain-growth-emerge-favourite-among-investors/articleshow/8212914.cms,m.economictimes.com,"HUL needs to up the game to sustain growth, emerge favourite among investors","
  A third consecutive quarter of a double-digit growth in revenues, driven largely by volume growth indicates a turnaround for HUL, which has had a stunted growth from 2009 till mid-2010. Efforts mounted by the company over the past few quarters now appear to be bearing fruit for the FMCG company. More than 50% of its product portfolio has either been relaunched or rebranded. 
  
  It has increased its coverage to 5,000 more stores — most of them in rural areas. A volume growth of 13.5%, in spite of past year’s high base in the face of an intense competition, looks impressive. Operating profit, which rose 9%, was largely impacted due to high input cost. 
  
  Selective product price increases and a calibrated adspend could not help the company boost operating profit margins. While the MNC consumer giant has successfully managed to defend its leadership across categories, the moot point is how much of this is sustainable in a high inflation scenario and growing competition from national and regional players as well as other multinational companies. In 2010, the company was seeking to push up volumes through price cuts and discounts on products. 
  
  This year, it has changed the tack and is taking price increases on products back to year-ago levels. The company has indicated that the mix of price and volume growth is likely to change since increase in prices may put pressure on volume growth. Investments in brands given competition and higher input cost inflation are two cost heads for FMCG firms. 
  
  For HUL, addressing this ought not be tough, considering its deep pockets. It will need to adjust adspends and brand equity to pass on input costs to consumers. However, soaps and detergents , the largest revenue-earner segment for HUL, continues to be a sore point for the company. This category is marked by competition, rising raw material prices and a slowdown in consumer demand. HUL appears to have adopted a wait and watch approach to gauge consumer behaviour in this category. 
  
  One of the few FMCG stocks to have declined since the start of 2011, HUL’s stock has now fallen 9%. With its performance back on track, the company’s stock, which is now trading at a price to earnings multiple of 27 and a dividend yield of 2.3%, looks attractive among FMCG stocks.

IFFCO's stake in National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd (NCDEX) has now reached 10 per cent. Last week, leading sugar firm Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd sold a 7.5 per cent stake in NCDEX to investors, including the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd (IFFCO), for Rs 66.54 crore. 

 ""We have bought 1.12 per cent stake in NCDEX at Rs 175 per share,"" a senior IFFCO official said. Of the stake sold by the sugar major, 5 per cent was acquired by the NSE, an original promoter of NCDEX. Renuka Sugars sold a 1.12 per cent stake to IFFCO and another 1.38 per cent to Star Agriwarehousing and Collateral Management. 

 Following the transaction, Renuka Sugars holds 5 per cent in NCDEX, the country's second-largest commodity exchange. NSE is now the largest shareholder in NCDEX with a 15 per cent stake, followed by Life Insurance Corporation of India and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, with 11.1 per cent each.

  What is your view on Reliance Industries, what do the chart suggests? 
   
  The downside in the Reliance looks little bit kept but yes the immediate resistance for Reliance is somewhere at 1018 and 1048 levels. Once that level is crossed, then again we would see Reliance testing the levels of 1100. So one has to wait for 1048 to be crossed then only momentum could be seen in this counter.

"IRFC likely to launch tax-free bonds worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/irfc-likely-to-launch-tax-free-bonds-worth-rs-4532-crore-on-december-8/articleshow/50035721.cms,m.economictimes.com,"IRFC likely to launch tax-free bonds worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8","MUMBAI: Investors, disappointed with the moderate allotments in recent tax-free bonds by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC), could gear up for the largest such issue in the financial year. Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) is said to be launching its tax-free bond issue worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8. 

 It is about 6.5 times the size of earlier issues of tax free bonds from NTPC, PFC and REC, which were of Rs700 crore each. Retail investors got meagre allotment in the earlier issuances due to the smaller size though 40% of the issue size was reserved for them .Typically those who applied for Rs1 lakh, got allotment worth Rs 12,000-15,000 due to heavy subscription. 

 Being a big issue, the chances of allotment in IRFC are higher. Distributors are urging investors to apply for a slightly higher amount to get their quota. “The issue size from IRFC is six times more than that of the earlier issues. 

 Interest rates on offer are also marginally higher,” says Jyotheesh Kumar, Senior Vice-President, HDFC Securities. These tax-free bonds will have three tenures — 10 years, 15 years and 20 years. The 10-year bonds for retail investors will carry 7.32%, 15-year bonds will offer 7.53%, while the 20-year bonds will offer 7.5%. 

 “If investors, want an allotment of Rs 5 lakh, they would do well to apply for about Rs8 lakh as we expect a 50-60% oversubscription in this issue as well,” says Rupesh Bhansali, Head (Distribution), GEPL Capital. High networth individuals, who typically make applications for over Rs10 lakh, could also look at splitting applications. 

 Investors, who want allotment of up to Rs40 lakh, could consider splitting applications across family members of Rs10 lakh each for their applications to be considered in the retail category. This also helps in getting a higher interest as the retail category carries a 0.25% higher interest as compared to the HNI category.

 ET Now: Is it a good time now to revisit some of those exporters because it is highly unlikely that Reserve Bank of India will allow rupee to appreciate quite dramatically? Because if the rupee appreciates, it will automatically challenge all the economic recovery. CAD problems will come to the fore and exporters will rendered extremely uncompetitive. What is your take on this?
 
 Prateek Agarwal: Yes, I would agree with you completely. The rupee has really appreciated to a level higher than was warranted. Policymakers themselves have been saying so. I thought they were comfortable when the rupee was at 60-61 kind of a band.
 
 It is vital for the economy that rupee stabilises at whatever level it touches. That alone can help people plan and export and grow. Extreme high degree of volatility in the rupee on the stronger side helps the market, but may not be good for the economy.
 
 We have seen what happened in the past when the rupee appreciated very sharply to 40. For some time, we had run a current account surplus but after that, the deficit became extremely huge. So, I am of the view that the rupee needs to stabilise. It should stabilise at current levels.
 
 After the sharp run-up in other parts of the market, exporters have been doing well. Markets have given them a miss. Perhaps it is time in terms of even sector rotation that the market looked at that pack.

Manoj Vaish new CEO of MCX; bourse to trim stake by January 18,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/manoj-vaish-new-ceo-of-mcx-bourse-to-trim-stake-by-january-18/articleshow/28299050.cms,m.economictimes.com,Manoj Vaish new CEO of MCX; bourse to trim stake by January 18,"MUMBAI: The bankers-dominated selection committee of the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) today elected Manoj Vaish as the new managing director and CEO of the exchange that is under the regulatory glare following troubles at the promoter group. 

 The regulator FMC had late last month said the promoter Jignesh Shah and the promoter group Financial Technologies were not ""fit and proper"" to run not only the crippled NSEL but also MCX and any other exchange in the country. 

 After a marathon board meet that lasted over six hours today, the new MCX board, comprising representatives of various banks, selected Manoj Vaish, who at present is the managing director of NSDL Database Management. 

 Vaish was an executive director of the BSE between 1998 and 2004 and CEO of financial services research firm Dun & Bradsheet. 

 The board interviewed seven candidates and three were shortlisted -- Dilip Bhatia, CEO of Ace Commodities Exchange; Anil Mishra, managing director and CEO of National Multi-Commodity Exchange and Manoj Vaish, sources said. 

 The interviews were conducted after Shreekant Javalgekar stepped down as the MD and CEO of MCX following the Rs 5,600-crore scam at its sister concern the National Spot Exchange (NSEL), co-promoted by MCX promoter Financial Technologies, in late July. 

 More than 70 people had applied for the top job at MCX, including two exchange insiders, a former National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) chief and officials of Reliance Commodities, IFCI, Central Depository Services and NSDL Database Management, sources said. 

 While Satyanand Mishra was appointed MCX chairman late last year, the selection of the new MD was important as FTIL promoter has already been declared as not fit and proper to run the exchange. 

 The board was also expected to consider FTIL and MCX stake dilution in MCX-SX, as per Sebi order. But nothing could be confirmed regarding this. 

 FTIL holds 26 per cent stake in MCX, which FMC had asked them to be brought down to 2 per cent. The board meeting however, decided to trim the promoters' stake to 5 per cent by January 18, according to sources.

Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel,” says Dhananjay Sinha, Director & Head of Strategy Research and Chief Economist, Systematix Shares and Stock

What is your view on the long-term trajectory for IT? The IT pack has undergone a considerable correction. Over the last year, the IT sector has been the worst performing after a very good run. So the IT sector has come down quite a bit and it has absorbed a lot of negative news. The key concern out here is with respect to the impending recession and the slowdown in the US and Europe. 
 
People have raised concern about their sales growth, etc. As of now, the IT companies, be it largecaps or midcaps, have not really sounded alarm with respect to their outlook. They appear to be fairly resilient. But the market is concerned about the outlook with respect to revenue growth. Of course, there is an issue with respect to margins. which is largely a factor of the boom that we saw last year.
 
That is broadly in the price but on a relative basis, the valuations have come down quite a bit. Large names have corrected from a PE valuation with a forward standpoint from something like 30-34 levels to currently about 24-23 levels. It has come down. There is still some amount of downside in valuation that is there. So maybe a 5-10% downside is possible but it is approaching a value zone as far as the IT sector is concerned. One should look at the largecaps.
 

How would you approach metals now given that on one side, there is a demand challenge and on the other side, there is a recession fear?With respect to metals, I have been an underweight for the last one year. We are looking at deceleration in the manufacturing sector across the world. If you look at the PMIs in developed markets, in Europe, the US and China, there has been significant deceleration and a marked contraction as well in major countries.
 
So the demand for metal is likely to be under pressure. If you look at various markets, there has been almost like a 40-50% correction in steel prices. Also with respect to aluminium, zinc, etc, there has been a considerable contraction. So I think metal space actually did very well last year, from an Indian player standpoint they benefited a lot through a large amount of exports and stuff. Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel. There is a glut in the domestic market and we are seeing that steel imports are also happening from China. 
 
There is intense competition and I have been a sell on steel and metal companies. I would continue to be so going forward because when central banks the world over are fighting inflation, commodities would not do well. For me, commodities in general and metals are underweight. So on any rise in steel and other metal stocks, I would sell.


The big macro concern, what is happening to the pound? How is the UK economy becoming topsy-turvy? What happens to companies which are dependent on the UK like Mastek, HCL Tech, TCS, Tata Motors?What we have to really put into context is that post Covid, Indian manufacturers actually enjoyed quite a bit of export exposure, especially given the context that there were fairly tight supply issues in the US, Europe and UK. There was a huge amount of fiscal stimulus. The volume growth for Indian manufacturers actually went up disproportionately.
 
ET Now: How would you view a business like Paytm? Purely the business, forget where the stock is headed?
Dhananjay Sinha: I think the Paytm business may do well. The best of volume growth is behind us, given the digitisation theme that was evident post Covid. A lot of that was being valued. Going forward, is this going to repeat the kind of buoyancy that we have seen earlier? I do not think so. Increasingly, the business model will have to be a function of what it does through the transactions, the buffer that it creates through transactions etc.
 
There are limitations with respect to what it can do. There are financial regulations that it will be subject to. So value creation from here on can be very limited.


What do you want to buy in a market decline?The risk of the market being on the downside is definitely there. We are looking at earnings cuts. In the first quarter, we have seen a 3.5% cut for Nifty earnings. We are looking at something like a 15% odd cut for the full year. So there is a downside as far as the market is concerned.
 
Secondly, given the context that the risk free rate is actually rising and more rate hikes will happen, the valuations might also be a challenge. Overall it would be relevant to be more defensive as far as the market is concerned. High beta sector such as metals, capital goods, industrials, mid and smallcaps are the things that will be relatively lower in my pecking order. 
 
I have been somewhat positive on urban consumption themes in autos, discretionary. Staples has done well, ITC continues to be a good value stock and continues to do well. Autos have done phenomenally well. Over the last year, I have reduced some overweight there. 
 
I would say that I am looking at pharma stocks at this juncture. There is a reasonable amount of visibility as far as the earnings are concerned and there are certain stocks which are available at good value and the sector has not done much over the last one year it comes at a good value. Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy, Ajanta and Indoco Remedies are some of the stocks that have come from our sort of pick. That is broadly the profile of things that we have in our portfolio.
 

Would you bet into oil consumers like Indigo?One should be looking at something like Asian Paints or Berger Paints because they have oil intermediates as inputs. They have a monopolistic market presence and pricing power etc. One should really look at such things. Asian Paints is something that I like in terms of valuations. Also, if you look at the market cap to sales ratio, what I look for has come down quite a bit over the last six odd months. 
 
So one would rarely get a chance in 20-30 years when we may see a sharp correction in such stocks. Any correction out here should be bought I would say so that is what you know I would play this oil with actually.

Kothari replaces SAIL chief C S Verma, who held the additional charge of CMD NMDC. 

 Earlier, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) has chosen Narendra Kothari, CEO of SAIL's Burnpur plant for the post of NMDC's CMD. NMDC, the country's largest iron ore miner, had been without a full-time chairman after retirement of its regular head Rana Som on December 31, 2011. 

 ""The Government of India has appointed Shri Narendra Kothari, CEO, SAIL as CMD on the Board of NMDC for a period of five years with effect from the date of assumption of charge of the post or till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier,"" NMDC said in a filing to the BSE. 

 In terms of the government order, Kothari has ""assumed charge of the post of CMD of NMDC on April 21, 2014,"" the miner said. It added that consequent to the development, Verma ceases to be CMD and Director of the Company with effect from April 21, 2014. 

 The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had in July 2011 suggested the name of M S Rana, CMD, Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India, for the post. But, the Steel Ministry was not in concurrence with the PESB's recommendation and instead gave company's Technical Director N K Nanda additional charge. 

 Following some issues that cropped up, SAIL Chief C S Verma was given the additional task and he continued at the helm of affairs of the country's top iron ore producer. Later, a panel headed by Planning Commission Member Arun Maira, recommended two candidates for the top job - Narendra Kothari and T K Lahiry, CMD of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd in May last year. NMDC produced 30.18 million tonnes (MT) iron ore in last fiscal and sold 30.50 MT of the key steel-making raw material.

  Paras Adenwala, MD & Principal Portfolio Manager, Capital Portfolio Advisors in a chat with ET Now talks about telecom stocks.
  
  
  Do you really sense that perhaps on a long-term basis while right now fair enough the telecom balance sheets are looking overstretched but with 3G because that has higher efficiency than the current 2G? Your BWA can be used for WiMAX as well and be used for 4G. On a long-term basis, do you see a whole lot of value accretion? 
  
  Yes, absolutely. Now the telecom companies would have to really focus on the value-added services as opposed to pure volume gain that they have been used to in the past and, therefore, there is tremendous amount of innovation that these people can do and keep on improving the margins, so once this competitive pressure eases out, it has already begun to ease out. 
  
  Once it settles down and the balance sheet also starts improving, that would be a time to really get back into some of the leading names and stay invested for the long term.

ET Now: Do you think the secular rally in cyclicals is now coming to an end, and cyclicals in general are getting slightly exhausted? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: This has been our long-held view. I can give you some numbers for your convenience. Take two of the most expensive stocks in, let us say, a sector like FMCG, which most commentators will say is a very expensive sector. Take two of the very high-quality MNC names in the capital goods space. Have an optimistic projection for capital goods by which I mean 15% plus kind of sales growth, margins which are way higher than the current margins and average margins. Then look at what kind of profits are arrived at and what kind of valuation they trade versus FMCG. 

 So, if you compare the two you would find the FMCG story to be much more compelling. I am in no way saying that it is cheap. Actually the so called defensive part of the market today trades cheaper than the cyclical part of the market. Pharmaceuticals are valued very nicely, IT is cheap while growth there may be an issue. Sectors like capital goods and public sector banks are trading at valuations which will probably make these sectors — in the best case scenario — move sideways for some length of time.

ET Now: What do you do with infra, stocks like IDFC and couple of other infra finances have corrected a quite a bit, still stay away from them? 

 
Sonam Udasi: No, it really depends on what is your perspective on the market. Our perspective is that in the near term despite what we have seen today, there is not much scope for you to rally further, you can do a 100 points here or there that said with the currency where it is and you are heading into an election year, despite the trade deficit coming where it is, it is likely that it will be perking up in July and August as well and as investors realise that if dollar is to stay here, they will look at gold positively. 

 If you cannot do dollar then gold is a natural hedge against the dollar in that sense so I suspect that with that view in mind in the near term the pressure will continue on IDFC. You will see bouts of buying and selling. But if you have a longer view, say 1-1/2 year kind of view, these valuations on IDFC and some of the stocks like BOB, PNB, you will only find when they are under stress and once that starts to clear out which I suspect will happen over six to eight months from now. Then that is real investment. But for now, you could probably buy IDFC after seven days again at the similar price which was yesterday.

UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/upa-takes-sheen-off-psu-stocks-since-it-came-to-power-in-2004/articleshow/29540056.cms,m.economictimes.com,UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,"The government’s family jewels have lost some of their sheen in the past 10 years. Shares of state-run companies have underperformed the broader market since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power in 2004, an ET Intelligence Group analysts shows. That comes after the PSU index outpaced the BSE Sensex by a huge margin during 1999-2004, when the BJP was heading the ruling coalition.
 
 The PSU index rose 60 per cent in the first term of the UPA, whereas the Sensex rose at double that pace during those five years starting 2004. Under UPA-II, the PSU index lost 6 per cent so far, compared with a 73 per cent gain in the benchmark.
 
 During the NDA rule, the PSU index that exists since February 1999 jumped more than 300 per cent, compared with a 70 per cent gain in the benchmark index. Base effect played a part in these comparisons, but there were other reasons as well that influenced the performance of PSU stocks during the UPA and NDA rules, an analyst said.
 
 ""The outperformance of PSUs starting 1999 was on the background of a severe industrial slowdown that had led a large number of companies into distress,"" said Phani Sekhar, fund manager of portfolio management services at Angel Broking.
 
 For instance, he said, the shares of Steel Authority of India were trading below their face value and banks were grappling with very high non-performing assets at that time, so ""a part of their subsequent out-performance was on a lower base"". However, he said, the NDA government also had a stated privatisation policy and it carried out privatisations of companies such as Hindustan Zinc and Maruti Suzuki, making PSUs lucrative for investors.
 
 ""This, along with improving GDP growth, helped PSUs to outperform."" Under the UPA’s first term, the department of disinvestment was closed down, he said. ""Environmental issues and policy flip-flops impacted investor perception towards PSUs, which were already richly priced.
 
 In the last couple of years, FPO (follow-up public offer) announcements destroyed valuations due to lack of buying appetite,"" Sekhar added. The BSE PSU index currently comprises 59 shares with Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Coal India , State Bank of India, NTPC and NMDC representing the top five constituents.
 
 Unlike other indices, which consider free-float market capitalisation of the constituents, the BSE-PSU index is based on full market capitalisation of its constituents and consists of PSUs from the BSE500 group. The data analysed by ETIG exclude those of banks due to their different reporting structure, and companies such as Coal India, Oil India and NHPC, which got listed mid way.
 
 
 As the data suggest, the last five years under the UPA-2 have been particularly bad for PSUs, although the government kept selling more shares in these companies in a bid to tide over a burgeoning fiscal deficit. The financials of these PSUs have also shown a steady decline in the second term of the UPA.
 
 Total return on equity and return on capital have shown a steady year-on-year decline from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2013. ""This is because the government did not create a regulatory environment suitable for doing business,"" blamed Sankaran Naren, chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential.
 
 Currently, they are a good value buy, but there is always the government risk existing in these stocks, he added. The return on equity and return on capital employed are important ratios that capture the amount of profits generated by a corporate per unit of investment made in it. Higher the ratio, the better. The price-to-book value of these companies has fallen to 1.2 now from 2 in 2009.
 
 In fact, the market values of a few companies such as SAIL, Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil and Nalco have dropped below their book value. Book value is the total net worth of a company and is calculated by adding reserves and surplus to the share capital. PSUs’ growing debt levels were another key factor making investors nervous.
 
 The debt of 53 listed PSUs — net of cash and bank balance — jumped over three-fold to Rs 2.64 lakh crore at the end of March 2013 from Rs 85,000 crore at the end of fiscal 2009. The biggest debt amassers were from two important industries — petroleum and power — which have seen policy-led impediments.
 
 Indian Oil, BPCL, HPCL, Power Grid and NTPC together held Rs 2.82 lakh crore net debt at end-March , more than doubled since fiscal 2009. On the other extreme, the top five cash-rich PSUs witnessed 80 per cent growth in their idle cash position between FY09 and FY13. It were the remaining 43 PSUs that witnessed a spurt in indebtedness, from less than Rs 1,500 crore in FY09 to Rs 86,000 crore in FY13.
 
 The most notable names turning from cashrich to highly indebted in this period include SAIL, Shipping Corporation and MTNL. This doesn’t mean the lot will continue to under-perform. ""Health-wise , the PSUs are much better placed today compared with 1998-99 ,"" said Angel’s Sekhar. ""It is regrettable that they are underperforming their potential. Given some policy clarity, they have the potential to out-perform once again.""

Want to bet on Infosys? Five reasons why you should wait and watch,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/want-to-bet-on-infosys-five-reasons-why-you-should-wait-and-watch/articleshow/36437210.cms,m.economictimes.com,Want to bet on Infosys? Five reasons why you should wait and watch,"NEW DELHI: The appointment of Vishal Sikka as the CEO and MD of India’s second largest software exporter has come as a fresh ray of light for the investors of Infosys as it clears the underlying uncertainty, but it will be a long haul before any meaningful recovery can be seen in the stock.

Infosys, which wore the tag of IT bellwether some time back, is now struggling to regain confidence of its investors. India’s second largest IT exporting company has been witnessing a tepid growth in sales and profits since the past four years.

The stock has plunged a little over 18 per cent from its peak of Rs 3847.20 recorded on 3 March 2014, marred by a series of senior level exits and slowdown in sales. On YTD basis, Infosys is down a little over 9 per cent, as of data collected on 11 June.

""Vishal Sikka will be the next CEO of Infosys. This could likely be a long haul even if he’s the right man for the jog,"" said JP Morgan in a report. Even if he is the right man for the CEO job at Infosys, time will only say so. We believe this might be a really long haul for both Dr. Sikka and Infosys, added the report.

Vishal Sikka, a former SAP AG executive board member, was on Thursday appointed as Infosys’ Chief Executive Officer and MD. With his appointment, Sikka becomes the first non-founder CEO of Infosys.

The company also announced that Executive Chairman NR Narayana Murthy and Executive Vice Chairman S Gopalakrishnan would step down on June 14. Rohan Murty will also leave the company on June 14.

We have collated five possible reasons why Infosys will remain subdued in the short term, but remains a good long-term bet:

Building the right team: The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock at least for the time being and building the right team will be most important task in light of the recent senior-level exits. Infosys is a more of service-led company and Vishal Sikka comes from a product background, which is very different from the services business.

""Rebuilding the team will be a major challenge for him since the core team has left the company. Vishal has to build his own team and that is very important because one person cannot change a large company like Infosys,"" said Former Infosys Board Member V Balakrishnan.

""He also has to quickly connect with the clients and give them comfort, because clients have been worried since the leadership transition took a long time,"" he added.

Balakrishnan is of the view that Vishal, with his pedigree, looks like the right person for this role, but the jury is still not out on whether he will be able to perform to his full potential.

In light of the recent top-level exits, Mr. Sikka’s first job would be to comfort the people and tell them that the company has faith in them despite the bad stretch. The challenge is to get the people believe in themselves and that they are for keeps.


	 

""This is the turning point for the company and calls for re-rating of the stock. However, the board also needs to get reconstituted in a manner that it has more independent ‘directors’ than what it has had at this point of time,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Consulting.

""The same board is not going to fix the problem, even if the CEO is different. Once you get the ghost out of the closet completely, you will find this company flying again,"" he added.



Brokerages are positive despite near-term concerns: 

Despite recent exits, most brokerage firms are positive on the stock and have a target price of Rs 3500-4000 for a period of the next 12 months.

Earlier in the month of June, Prasad Thrikutam, the global head for sales and marketing at Infosys, resigned from the company. Thrikutam’s exit came a week after Infosys President and CEO-hopeful BG Srinivas resigned and was the 12th senior-level exit after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to the company as the executive chairman last June.



				


JP Morgan has an ‘overweight’ rating on the stock and a target price of Rs 4000 by March 2015. Infosys appears to have more realistic targets in the current environment, which we believe is positive.

Their price target is based on a one-year forward P/E of 16.5x, at a modest (15%) discount to TCS’ target multiple of 19.0x. They believe that the discount is justified as TCS’ revenue growth and margin profile are better than that of Infosys.

IndiaNivesh is of the view that the stock is trading at 14.8x FY15E and 12.9x FY16E earnings estimates. Given the stable global environment, they are of the view that Infosys FY15 guidance is a bit on the conservative side. Hence they expect the upward revision in the guidance going ahead.

The brokerage firm has a 'BUY' rating on the stock with a target price to Rs.3,952 (valuing at 16.4x FY16E EPS).

May lead to more senior-level exits:

Infosys had been evaluating internal candidates for the CEO position as well and appointment of Dr. Sikka might drive another wave of resignation from the internal CEO hopefuls. So, the biggest challenge for Infosys will be of retaining talent.

However, the organization will likely stabilize after that, say experts. JP Morgan is of the view that Mr. Murthy’s stepping down should provide significant freedom to Dr. Sikka to rebuild the organization as per his vision.

Ankit Pandey of Quant Broking is of the view that there is still some uncertainty that will remain over the next three to four months. More people may decide to leave, he added.

""But there needs to be more hiring as well, especially because they have lost so many people at the top,"" added Pandey. So over the next six to nine months, there will be a lot of travelling, a lot of meeting with the clients and getting to know the company as a whole,"" he explained.


	 

Slowdown in growth likely to continue:

The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock for the time being, but revival in growth will take its time.

Although Dr. Sikka would bring in fresh thinking to the organization as a technology visionary, but being an outsider he would likely take time to figure out Infosys’ issues, culture, ways of working, politics, competitive landscape, onerous task of rebuilding a team - all of which will take time to show results. JpMorgan believes that Infosys’ expected recovery to industry-level revenue growth by FY16E will likely get pushed out further (maybe to FY17E or even beyond). All in all, they believe the company will take a longer-than-earlier expected time to get back to the respectable growth trajectory.

Apart from his valuable experience at SAP, Mr. Sikka will bring along his entrepreneur like visibility and proven success in tough global markets to the company.

""Although under his helm, Infosys may witness an improvement in performance through transition of activities, we believe that it may take time for the company to return to its growth trajectory,"" Microsec Capital said in a report.

""For the stock, the development is expected to remain positive in the near to medium term. However, the long term movement of the stock will continue to be determined by Infosys performance and improvement checkpoints in the quarters to come,"" added the report.

Sikka will be instrumental in boosting sales:

The appointment of Dr. Vishal Sikka's as the CEO and MD (designate) of Infosys is a positive development for the company and being a former SAP AG board member, analysts and industry experts expect him help the company win business from his former customers at SAP.

He will bring an innovation focus to the former IT industry bellwether, at a time when the industry is undergoing fundamental changes, ET reported.

In addition, his strong client relationships can help Infosys win business with new and old customers and improve revenue growth, Deutsche Bank said in a report. However, with his products background, we are concerned about Mr. Sikka’s ability to run a services company, it said.

Investors will now seek direction and clarifications from the new management on addressing issues of (a) high attrition, especially in sales, (b) loss of business and strategic vendor status from existing customers impacting revenue growth and (c) below par presence and acceptance in key growth market continental Europe, added the Deutsche Bank report.

"AirAsia offers 2 mn cheap tickets, fly from Kolkata to Bangkok for Rs 3,300",neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/airasia-offers-two-million-cheap-tickets-to-south-east-asian-cities/articleshow/19325703.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,AirAsia offers two million cheap tickets to South East Asian cities,"NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of its India entry, Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia has opened bookings for two million seats between April 2 and 7, 2013 offering air tickets as cheap as Rs 3,300 to South East Asian destinations for travel next year.

One can fly from Kolkata to Bangkok for all-in-fare of Rs 3,300, Chennai to Bangkok for Rs 3,500, Bangalore to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 5,500 , Kolkata to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 5000, Kochi or Chennai to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 4500 and from Tiruchirapalli to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 4000, a statement by the budget carrier on Monday said.

“We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns in such a scale. It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” Siegtraund Teh, Group Chief Commercial Officer of AirAsia said.

“Free seats to domestic Malaysia destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru, Terengganu and more are also available from Kuala Lumpur . Only taxes and fees apply to these free seats, which will be available from INR 0 one way,” the statement added.

These tickets can be booked for a travel period of January 1–April 30, 2014, which, according to AirAsia officials is in line with the airline’s standard practise of encouraging advance bookings.

“This is a standard promotion offer all over the world for all routes and nothing to do with India entry as we may enter even before January next,” a company official said, declining to be named.


				

	
	The official also said that their offer was different from the one recently offered by Tiger Airways.
	
	In March, Singapore-based Tiger Airways opened a promotional offer for tickets to Singapore from Chennai, Kochi, Bangalore, Hyderabad Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchirapalli at $50 (Rs 2700) for travel between May 1st and December 15th. The tickets will be on offer until March 13.
	
	The scheme, which offered 10 seats on each flight, was one to celebrate five years of its Indian operations.
	
	In an earlier story, ET had reported that AirAsia’s standard practise is to open seat bookings a few months in advance at a nominal price, going up to ten times that sum near the flight day.

	 

	The idea is to stimulate the market with low fares till a certain percentage of seats are filled and then go to the highest levels. This is standard AirAsia practise across its network in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Japan arms, which would be later replicated in India.
	
	AirAsia flies 186 routes, covering 85 destinations throughout 18 countries.
	
	“We have predicted a fare war in the next 12 months. This is a precursor. AirAsia is stimulating the market in the backdrop of their India entry. Even if they sell 1 million seats at say Rs 4,000, we are looking at an upfront cash collection of Rs400 crore, which can help fund their India plans.

	
	This may force other Indian carriers to follow suit since the January-April period typically sees limited tourism traffic,” said Amber Dubey, partner and head (aviation) at global consultancy KPMG. Jet Airways, India’s secondlargest airline by market share, and Air India did not respond to ET’s queries. 


	Last Wednesday, the government cleared AirAsia’s proposal to start a passenger airline in India in partnership with the Tata Group and Telstra Tradeplace’s Arun Bhatia, whose son is married to the daughter of NRI billionaire Lakshmi Mittal. AirAsia will hold 49% stake, Tata Sons 30% and Bhatia 21% in the new venture.
	
	Rajan Mehra, a former India head for Qatar Airways and the managing director (India) for Universal Aviation — a business aviation services provider, said most airlines float such offers when they enter a new market. 


	“Such an offer is the best bet to make people aware that a customer-friendly airline is coming to town. So, in a way, it is a backhanded way of advertising their product. This could cause a cascading effect (in terms of response from other airlines),” Mehra said.
	
	Himanshu Singh, managing director of online travel portal Travelocity, concurred with Mehra’s views on AirAsia’s seat sale, but doubted whether Indian airlines would respond to the offer. “Indian carriers are mature enough not to react to such discounts. 
	 

	Given that AirAsia is entering India with a long-term plan, they will sooner or later look to tap passengers through a hub & spoke model, like Spice-Jet, and would want to fly Indians out. This scheme may well be the groundwork for that,” Singh surmised. “We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns at such a scale. 


	It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” said Siegtraund Teh, group chief commercial officer of AirAsia. “Free seats to domestic Malaysian destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru and Terengganu are also available from Kuala Lumpur.

	These tickets were on offer till March 13. The Tiger Airways scheme, which offered 10 seats on each flight, was to celebrate five years of its operations in India.

ET Now: IT sector has disappointed a bit with results from IT biggies Wipro and HCL Technologies coming in a tad below market expectations. Now, it's Infosys, which is lined up for results on Friday. Do you think that the whole of IT pocket is now approaching the oversold territory? Will IT stocks see more downside or is the sector a structural short for some more months to come?
 
 
Ajay Bagga: IT firms may clock a growth of 12-15 per cent on the topline front; expect them to report a similar growth on the bottom line front. As far as margins are concerned, it seems that they do not have much scope for improvement at least in the next 12 months.
 
 Overall, the sector is getting rerated from a high-growth sector to a sector more like utility. Having said that, IT stocks will give you decent returns. There will be no negative surprises; IT firms have managements that are pro-minority shareholders. Looking at these factor , I would recommend investors to look at IT as a global play.
 
 An advisor to the RBI has recently said that rupee is overvalued. He said he would be happy if rupee drops to to 64-65 levels against the greenback.
 
 If this happens, then IT could be a good hedge for Indian investors. Consumers will lose purchasing power once rupee starts falling. Hence, keeping IT in your portfolio will help you.
 
 It is a natural hedge and it is a global growth story. So own IT stocks with that perspective, especially when domestic consumption is getting constraint the way it is. With the poor monsoon, the consumption space could be hurt even more. IT will give you some balance in the portfolio. Having said that, I do not expect them to be top performers.
 
 IT managements are clearly lacking inspirational wisdom. If you look at the US market, they give back $600 billion to shareholders every year via share buybacks. They pay $400 billion in dividends.
 
 If you are doing nothing and keeping surplus cash in fixed deposits or liquid funds at 8 per cent rate, then it is better give it back to the shareholders at least. Here, I am talking about domestic IT companies.

If one goes by the enthusiasm with which Rakesh Jhunjhunwala participated in the company's earnings conference call, it could well be his next Titan Industries.
 
 ""Sir, congratulations to you and your team on unbelievable results,'' said Jhunjhunwala. ""Is your better margins also reflecting the fact that you were utilising the same plants for higher production. Because, I've not seen any analyst report which highlights this, or no realisation of the fact that higher utilisation will give you much higher margins.""
 
 Jhunjhunwala, known as the Indian Buffett, follows some of the fundamentals of investing of Buffett, renowned for value-based investing. Buffett, the world's fourth richest man, stunned investors when he bought the rail company Burlington Santa Fe at the peak of 2008 credit crisis, when economies were contracting. But his bet proved talismanic with a boom in shale gas exploration making Burlington a money machine.
 
 Something similar could be in the making with Tata Motors, which is riding high on its pre-crisis acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover. The company though has been squeezed in the domestic economic slowdown, has been reporting record profits due to Jaguar Land Rover.
 
 Jhunjhunwala, who made a strong impression as a value investor with his ownership of Titan Industries and Crisil, has been favouring Tata Motors even as others were sceptical about the company’s ability to manage the JLR acquisition. Tata Steel, a group company, is still struggling after it acquired Corus Group in 2007.
 
 But it is altogether a different story at Tata Motors. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 4,805 crore, up 195%, as against a net profit of Rs 1,628 crore in the yearago period.
 
 A Jhunjhunwala questions also reflects his worry.
 
 “Are you not afraid that you’re going into too many segments, and your brand may be affected.” But the comforting management words were that both Jaguar and Range Rover vehicles will maintain their product appeal and the brand and the value they stand for.

ET Now: What is the first stock on your radar? Why is it that you like this stock?
 
 
G Chokkalingam: We like Moil. The stock has been underperforming the market for more than four years. The reason for selecting the stock is that I believe that manganese ore prices have bottomed out post the recent correction. The company has got huge cash as well. The cash itself is 80 per cent of the market cap. With Rs 20 EPS for the current year, if profit grows at that rate - which are very likely - the core assets of the company would be free in the next 1-2 years.
 
 The current market mcap would be equivalent to the free cash itself. In addition, we saw some forecast coming in from Chinese Steel Association last week. It said the Chinese capacity is going to be shut for at least 20 per cent of the total capacity. So I believe that in next six months, the metal outlook particularly for steel industry would start improving. This would be positive for Moil. Aalso this company has increased its capacity in the last two years. It has got new mines in Maharashtra. All these point towards a robust outlook for Moil.

"Foreigners stay with HDFC Bank, bet on ADRs, futures after hitting FII stock cap",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/foreigners-stay-with-hdfc-bank-bet-on-adrs-futures-after-hitting-fii-stock-cap/articleshow/39139863.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Foreigners stay with HDFC Bank, bet on ADRs, futures after hitting FII stock cap","HDFC Bank’s stock may appear to have fallen out of favour with foreign investors over the past few months. However, that is far from the case as the performance of the New York Stock Exchange-listed HDFC Bank ADR during this period shows. 

 Foreign investors have not been able to purchase the India-listed HDFC Bank’s stock as it has hit the limit of 49% for foreign institutional investors or FIIs. But while HDFC Bank’s stock closed at Rs 835.50 on Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday, its ADR closed with a premium of more than 17% at about Rs 981 (after conversion). As the accompanying chart shows, the gap has widened consistently over the past six months. 

 At the same time, foreign investors have also been buying HDFC Bank’s stock in the futures market that can be converted into cash position if the FII limit in the bank is raised. Average monthly open interest for HDFC Bank in the futures market has been consistently increasing month after month. It has tripled in the past six months, compared with an increase of 35% for ICICI Bank and 74% for Axis Bank. 

 “If the FII limit is hiked, all these positions will be converted into cash positions, which can result in huge buying in the stock,” said Viraj Gandhi, senior analyst with ICICI Direct. 

 The average open interest in HDFC Bank’s stock for July was 3.4 crore, compared to 1.1 crore in January, while the cash volume in July was just about 60 lakh.
 
 
 “The stock is very attractively priced and is consolidating due to technical reasons. Nobody is willing to wait for the final approval on the limit as this price may not be available then, hence the huge position built up in the derivatives market and in ADR,” said a US-based hedge fund manager, who did not wish to be identified. “If the limit is hiked the HDFC bank’s stock price and HDFC Bank’s ADR price should converge somewhere in between.” 

 HDFC Bank has proposed to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India for an increase in the FII limit to 74% from 49% currently. It is not clear, though, whether the parent HDFC’s 22% stake in the bank will be included in the overall holding of FIIs, who already own 77% of HDFC’s shares. A decision in favour of the bank, as many traders and analysts expect by September, will raise the limit for foreign investors. 

 HDFC Bank’s stock has remained range-bound in the past three months even as the benchmark BSE Sensex has gained 16% while its peers Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have given 30% and 17% returns respectively. 

 Analysts say that this trend could reverse in the coming months, with a possible increase in limit for FII holding, equity issuance and talks of merger with HDFC.

Forward Markets Commission to hire 20 experts on contract basis to ease staff crunch,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/forward-markets-commission-to-hire-20-experts-on-contract-basis-to-ease-staff-crunch/articleshow/33824763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Forward Markets Commission to hire 20 experts on contract basis to ease staff crunch,"NEW DELHI: Facing a major staff crunch when the NSEL's Rs 5,600 crore payment crisis has deepened, commodity markets regulator FMC has decided to recruit 20 experts and professionals on contract basis to assist it in legal, investigation and other matters. 

 The Forward Markets Commission (FMC), under the Finance Ministry, is functioning with less than 100 officers and staff against a sanctioned strength of 135. Vacant posts have not been filled due to poor responses to job advertisements. 

 To augment its manpower position for the discharge of regulatory functions, the FMC has posted an advertisement inviting applications for the engagement of 20 experts or professionals on contract basis. 

 FMC wants to hire six candidates each in the legal and inspection departments, two staffers in investigation and one each in monitoring and surveillance, cyber forensic, company secretary, statistician, human resources and information and communication technology, it said. 

 Experts and professionals would be recruited at various levels in Mumbai and Delhi. Initially, they would be recruited for one year, which can be extended as per requirements. The applicants should be below 60 years of age. 

 The government has received lukewarm responses to job advertisements posted regularly since 2005. Now that the workload has increased in the wake of the NSEL payment crisis, FMC has taken the contract route to recruit officers. 

 The regulator oversees the functioning of six national and 11 regional bourses in the country.

""We certainly see a turnaround time in 2013-14 fiscal subject to business condition,"" GMR Group Chief Financial Officer Amarthaluru Subbarao said. ""We expect fund raising to be completed over the next six to nine months,"" he said.

The Bangalore-based conglomerate has also embarked on an 'asset light and right strategy' for the future after having piled up net debt of Rs 33,600 crore.

It plans to raise around Rs 4,000 crore through stake sales by the end of current fiscal. This, along with higher earning from airport division after recent tariff revision, is expected to help GMR Infrastructure report profits next fiscal.

GMR Infrastructure, which operates India's largest airport in New Delhi, posted a consolidated net loss of 94 crore for the quarter ended June 2012, up from Rs 67 crore a year ago, due to higher tax paid by the company and losses incurred by Delhi airport and power divisions. The group plans to divest up to 21 per cent stake in GMR Infrastructure, which will bring down the promoter holding to 51 per cent. ""We do not have any specific target but we do not intend to go below 51 per cent at any point of time,"" Subbarao said. ""If we get appropriate price we will seriously consider the option. However, stake dilution will happen in tranches,"" he added.

The company's energy segment, which posted 156 per cent jump in its net loss at Rs 27 crore last quarter, is also scouting for investors to meet equity requirement of the ongoing power project and let private equity investors exit. The company requires Rs 1,500 crore equity to fund ongoing power projects over the next two year.

""We have an option of divesting up to 26 per cent at energy vertical through strategic investment, or bring investor at project level. We may also look at exiting projects like Island Power if required,"" Subbarao said.

GMR is also willing to divest up to 15 per cent stake in its Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils to a strategic investor.

The company is also in talks with investors to sell up to 74 per cent stake in its toll-based projects. Currently, road division contributes one-tenth of GMR's annual revenues. GMR Highways business has six toll- and four annuity-based projects either completed or under construction.

""NHAI allows us to divest majority stake at project level, if investors want controlling stake and meet our objectives we are open to hit,"" Subbarao said. ""We expect to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore through stake sale and will use it to meet equity requirement of Kishangarh-Udaipur-Ahmedabad road project,"" he added.

	 
Subbarao said the company is looking at asset light and right strategy for future projects. It now plans to pick up minority stake in infrastructure projects, run these for two-three years and exit with a premium. It may also look at owning majority stake in projects that have enough cash flow and do not require equity infusion.

GMR's debt has increased to Rs 32,900 crore in 2011-12 from Rs 3,700 crore five years earlier, according to a recent report by global financial service firm Credit Suisse.

Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gold-schemes-by-pm-modi-right-in-time-to-celebrate-dhanteras-d-k-aggarwal/articleshow/49697871.cms,m.economictimes.com,Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,"By D K Aggarwal
 
 Apart from physical gold, this Dhanteras – the gold and silver buying festival – one can also avail the benefit of investing into the recently-launched three gold-related schemes, including India gold coin bearing the Ashok Chakra (available in denominations of 5 gm and 10 gm), gold monetisation, and sovereign gold bond.
 
 Importantly, instead of buying gold in physical form, investors can now park their money in bonds that are backed by gold. The idea behind launching gold monetisation schemes (GMS) is to tap household gold, which has been estimated to be of around 22,000 tonnes.
 
 Moreover, the recently-launched sovereign bond scheme would offer the same benefits as physical gold and can be used as collateral for loans and can also be traded on stock exchanges.
 
 At the time of selling, customers can earn returns as per the current price of gold. This scheme would help shift part of the estimated 300 tonnes of physical gold, which is purchased every year (in the form of gold bars and coins) in the country for investment.
 
 At the same time, it will relieve investors of the need to check the quality of gold and with valuation. Gold monetisation would help individual to earn up to 2.50 per cent interest rate on their idle gold. Investors can invest for medium term (between 5 and 7 years) as well as long term (12-15 years tenure).
 
 This initiative is likely to increase the productivity of the commercial banks as well as of the NBFCs. NBFCs are authorised to collect the application form and submit in banks and post offices.
 
 It is expected that with the launch of these schemes, India would be able to check its current account deficit (CAD). Actually, Indians are obsessed with the physical gold and India has suppressed China in case of its appetite for it. To note, India’s current account deficit stood a record $190 billion in 2013.
 
 This has prompted the then UPA government to hike import duty on it to a record 10 per cent. The efforts of government have helped India to import an estimated $34 billion of gold during the year 2014-15 much lesser then the previously imported.
 
 To note, India is the world’s top gold consumer. It is in 10th position among the top 10 countries that hold the most gold in their central banks; the Reserve Bank of India holds 557.7 tonnes of the precious metal.

Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/income-tax-department-lens-on-rs-5-lakh-crore-share-sales-by-india-inc/articleshow/34394326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,"MUMBAI: More than 5,000 closely held companies will come under the glare of the income tax department for transferring funds through suspicious share-sale deals. According to information compiled by the tax office, about Rs 5 lakh crore changed hands in past six years as 26,000-odd unlisted firms belonging to large and mid-sized corporate houses transferred funds by issuing equity and preference shares at high premiums.
 
 Tax officers believe that as much as 25% of these transactions may not be genuine. They have come across deals where equity shares having a face value of Rs 1 were sold to another entity at a premium of Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 10 shares were issued at a premium of Rs 49 lakh, said a source aware of the ongoing I-T investigation.
 
 
Many share sale deals defy logic
 
 In two cases, involving the same corporate group, three shares of Rs 10 each were offered at a premium of more than Rs 100 crore a share. “There are many such deals that defy logic and it will be difficult for companies with little activity and capital of few lakhs to justify the premium,” said a government official.
 
 On April 25, ET had reported that the tax department, in a directive issued a day before the fiscal closing, questioned hundreds of companies on the premium collected against the sale of shares. The companies have been told to justify the premiums, failing which the amount would be treated as income and therefore taxed. The 26,000 cases relate to companies based in Maharashtra. More firms will be covered with the department’s offices in some of the northern states initiating similar procedures.
 

 Corporate groups often use their unlisted arms to enter into such transactions either to generate cash or convert unexplained cash into income. Say, entity A needs Rs 5 crore cash for a property deal or to arrange a payoff. While it has the money, it fears withdrawing the amount from bank would alert tax authorities. Instead, it strikes a deal with B, which has cash and is looking for a way to legitimise it. B issues shares to A, receives Rs 5 crore through official banking channels and pays A the amount in cash. Such deals are also used to
 
 bring back funds that may have earlier been siphoned out from a company. But three senior tax professionals ET spoke to said that such cases are unlikely to exceed 5% of total transactions. The department, according to them, has rattled many companies by putting a question mark on bona fide transactions such as issuance of shares to joint venture partners, promoters and financial investors.
 
 “Fewer shares with higher premium are also issued to keep the authorised capital low and reduce fees paid to the Registrar of Companies,” said one of the tax practitioners. The particular section in the law that empowers the department to demand taxes on unjustified premiums came into effect on April 1, 2013. But based on the Bombay High Court ruling in the case Major Metals Ltd versus Union of India, the department maintains that it has the power to tax cases related to unjustified premiums even prior to this date.
 
 According to the department, in a case where the share premium charged is in excess of their intrinsic valuation, there is ground for invoking the provisions of Section 68 of the Income-Tax Act, which requires the assessee to explain not only the ‘source’ of the credit entry but also its ‘nature’. The assessments that have been reopened pertain to those in 2008-09, which would have become time-barred after March 31, 2014. But the department is collecting data for subsequent years as well.

Infusion of additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders: Barclays,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/an-extra-1-trillion-to-indias-gdp-by-2020-makes-midcaps-hot-say-experts/articleshow/50090410.cms,m.economictimes.com,"An extra $1 trillion to India's GDP by 2020 makes midcaps hot, say experts","NEW DELHI: Consumption might become one of the biggest themes to track in the next 4-5 years, thanks to the government's reform push, feel experts. A renewed thrust to capital spending, they say, could add up to $1 trillion to India's GDP in the next 4-5 years.  	According to a report by Barclays, urban spending, reforms such as GST and government capital expenditure are all set to boost consumption.  	Midcaps are likely to benefit more out of the spending push.  	""The pay panel hike and One Rank One Pay (OROP) will aid consumer spend going forward, which could lead to infusion of an additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders,"" Barclays said.  	For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets  	The S&P BSE Midcap index rose over 4 per cent so far in 2015 compared to an over 7 per cent fall in the S&P BSE Sensex. Most of the midcaps stocks have pared gains but are still trading with gains of up to 70 per cent recorded in the last one year.  	Some of the midcaps that outperformed both Sensex, and BSE Midcap index include names such as Ashok Leyland (up 75%), Bajaj Finance (up 70%), 3M India (up 69%), Wockhardt (up 63%), and Britannia Industries (up 60%).  	""There are lot many opportunities in mid-cap space in various sectors, I am not denying that and these are completely bottom up opportunities in terms of sectors or in terms of companies themselves,"" said Parag Thakkar, Head-Institutional Sales, HDFC Securities.  	A large part of the success in the rally of midcap stocks can be attributed to domestic mutual funds that have poured in close to Rs 90,000 crore so far in the year 2015.  	According to the report, inflows in equity MFs in November stood at Rs 6,300 crore with AUM in the category rising by 1.5 per cent to a new high of Rs 4,03,000 crore.  	""If the trend continues of money coming into domestic funds, which have seen for the last 15 months or so then I suspect the mid-caps will continue to do well, because many of the mutual funds are quite adapt at finding the right ideas and putting money in mid-caps,"" said Sanjeev Prasad, Kotak Institutional Equities.  	""FPI investors typically look at large caps and as of now the indications are that you would not see too much of fresh money coming into emerging market funds but these things can always reverse,"" he added.  	While choosing which midcap stocks to invest, Prasad is of the view that investors should look buying stocks based on bottom-up analysis, and whether the stock price justifies the fundamentals at given point of time.  	Midcaps stocks usually perform well when economy is growing, and when public as well as private spending increases. But, additional funds up to $1trillion will certainly be beneficial for some of midcap names.  	Although, it is difficult to put a timeline as to when this amount of money will be come into India's GDP, but experts see it happening by the year 2020.  	""It will be difficult to precisely know when $1trillion will be added in the economy because of various developmental initiatives taken by the government, but by 2020 addition of $1 trillion looks achievable,"" said Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities.   	""Though, we believe pay commission effects will be just incremental as the payout this time will be staggered, but GST will bring in break through and cause far reaching changes in the economy.

Deven Choksey: It is possible that the de-allocation of JSPL could create disruption in their business. However, there is a possibility that instead of completely de-allocating and making the company suffer on the business front, they may probably go for the revised policy which may be an auction route in which the company may end up paying a little higher price but not asked to completely surrender the coal blocks. 

 Since we do not have clarity on this subject as yet, I would refrain from making any further comments on it. If the situation I mentioned earlier permits their economic value, it should not affect JSPL beyond a point.

Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/meera-sanyal-to-quit-royal-bank-of-scotland-for-a-full-time-career-in-politics/articleshow/19467763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,"
	MUMBAI: Meera Sanyal, the 51-year old banker who stunned political observers and bankers alike by contesting the South Mumbai constituency against Milind Deora in 2009, is hanging up her boots to plunge into political life ahead of the forthcoming general elections.
	
	The daughter of late Vice Admiral G Hiranandani, a gallantry award winner and author of works on Indian naval history, will quit as the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, India, to involve in socio-political life full time, said two people familiar with the matter. It is not known whether Sanyal, a member of the Indian Liberal Group, would join any political party.
	
	Sanyal, a fan of Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, shot into fame when she filed nomination papers to contest against Deora, son of Congress politician and former minister of Petroleum Murli Deora. She lost the elections in 2009, but not the spirit. She got 10,157 votes, or about 1.6 per cent of the total polled. Deora won. She chose to contest elections following dismay at the response of the authorities to the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 which killed 164 people and set the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi on fire.
	
	Sanyal, who had said that she had given a quarter century of her life to banking, will give the next quarter century to political life, could not be reached for comment.
	
	“Meera H Sanyal is relinquishing her executive responsibilities as Country Executive, to devote herself more fully to the social, economic and political causes in India, that she is passionate about,” a statement from RBS said. “We are in the process of finalising an external successor for this role and will announce that person in due course.” Meera will continue to chair the India Services Executive Committee and the RBS India Foundation.
	
	Some in the industry welcome her decision to jump to political life. “It’s terrific,"" said said Jamal Mecklai, CEO, Mecklai Financial Services. “The truth is India will not get anywhere unless educated people enter politics. A governance revolution has been ignited in India and she’s put her hat in the ring. I hope this inspires other people as well.""
	
	Born on October 15, 1961, Sanyal had her school education in Mumbai and New Delhi. Unlike many management aspirants who head to the US, she travelled to France to complete her management education from Insead. When she nearly gave up on job hunt and was about to return to the West, she had an offer from Grindlays Bank which led to a near three decade of banking career.

	 

	
	
	In 1992 she joined ABN Amro, that was acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland, and served in many departments including administration when she introduced hiring people with different abilities and weaker sections, though on merit. “She is cerebral, articulate and a sharp person,"" says a former colleague now with a rival who did not want to be identified. “Meera was always responsible for the administrative function. People who work under have good things to say.""
	Although she has not shared her political thought in public, given her background and her tweets, she may be closer to the liberal economic philosophy, than a welfare state approach.
	
	The Thatcher era comes to an end! Rest in peace Maggie - you reformed & liberalised politics & economics for an entire generation,'' Sanyal tweeted after the Britain's Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher died on Monday.
	
	Sanyal was also convenor of the Indian Liberal Group, an association of people with liberal thoughts, founded by Minoo Masani, especially when it comes to economic policies opposing Congress party's statist policies.
	
	Her commitment to policies may be strong, but to be politically successful in the poor dominated system, she may have to change her ways if she has to succeed.
	
	She'll have to lose those pearls first,'' said writer Shobha De before the 2009 elections. And switch to earthy, home spun salwar kameezes before that. But how on earth will she communicate her objectives to a constituency that has been spoilt and nurtured over decades by politicos with pockets as deep as the ocean?''

A week ago, it had mobilised Rs 1,500 crore by offering the same securities.
 
 “We have got approval for Rs 3,769 crore collectively this year, and are raising it in two tranches as we did not collect the full amount in the first issue,” a senior company official told ET, confirming the second tranche of fund raising.
 
 The bonds will open for bidding on Wednesday as the coupon rate is expected to be fixed above 10-15 basis points higher than the benchmark government bonds.
 
 
 “The fixed spread finalised in the bidding process will be added to the average of two weeks' benchmark sovereign bonds estimated at 8.19%,” said an investment banker familiar with the matter, but didn't wish to be named.
 
 This means, the annualised yield could be at 8.50-8.51% compared with 8.41% in the earlier issue. MTNL securities are rated triple-A (Structured Obligation) by rating companies Crisil and Care.
 
 Structured Obligation signifies the government guarantee, which can be invoked when the issuer defaults in interest repayments.
 
 “The spread between the sovereign and government-guaranteed corporate bonds has contracted significantly to 10-20 bps from about 60 bps last year. This has helped issuers in terms of cost of borrowings,” said Ajay Manglunia, head -fixed income, Edelweiss Securities.
 
 “FIIs, which almost exhausted their investment limit in the G-Secs, are now investing in these securities.”
 
 Last week, FCI bonds slipped two bps below the similar government bonds on higher demand from overseas investors but later corrected a bit. Bond yields and prices move in opposite direction.
 
 MTNL, Food Corporation of India and Air India are three bond issuers who are in the same league, with all of them enjoying a sovereign guarantee status.
 
 Despite not being in the best of financial health, overseas investors rush to lap up these securities as they treat them as quasi-government securities.
 
 Earlier, big investors like HSBC, JPMorgan were seen investing in such issues.

 OVL last week concluded a $1.001 billion deal to buy US energy major Hess Corp's 2.7% stake in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in Azerbaijan, and 2.4% of the associated BTC pipeline. 

 ""It makes sense to raise cheaper debt through overseas bond issuance,"" OVL Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event here. The company had initially planned to issue its maiden overseas bond between January and March, but delayed it to complete the acquisition. 

 He said refinancing was easier since all of OVL's assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars. 

 The company, which gets most of its funds from its parent firm, has already appointed merchant bankers for raising the debt, a source said. ""There is no doubt that dollar debt is cheaper than rupee borrowings,"" he said. 

 The Azerbaijan acquisition was OVL's biggest since 2009 when it bought UK-listed, Russia-focused Imperial Energy for $2.1 billion. 

 ACG, which is located in the south Caspian Sea, about 95 km off the coast of Azerbaijan, is the largest oil and gas field complex in Azerbaijan and one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/quick-heal-may-be-indias-first-pure-software-co-to-take-the-ipo-route/articleshow/31860061.cms,m.economictimes.com,Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,"MUMBAI: A decade ago, it took Quick Heal time and hard work to convince software giant Microsoft that the small Indian outfit was serious about the business of building anti-virus software.
 
 Since then, Quick Heal, which started out as a gadget repair shop, has risen to become an IPO prospect, travelling a path that was far from easy. When they file their draft red herring prospectus in December, they might well be the first pure software products company from India to list, although others such as Mumbai-listed Persistent Systems build software for global customers.
 
 In 1990, Kailash Katkar, who says he barely passed his matriculation, started a calculator and computer repair shop with 15,000 from his savings. His younger brother Sanjay Katkar was studying computer science at an engineering college, and was working on an anti-virus project and often came to practice on the shop's computer.
 
 ""We noticed that every time Sanjay came, the computer would work properly and if he had not come for sometime there would be lots of problems. So, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just running these programmes he had created to clean out the viruses,"" said Kailash Katkar.
 
 That was how Quick Heal was born. The company initially sold the software along with annual maintenance contracts, a business that Katkar kept active until 1999 to fund the anti-virus business. ""When we started we couldn't get any money from banks. No one wanted to trust us. Now, they keep chasing us and we have to tell them that we don't need money,"" said Kailash, who is the CEO of the company, with his brother Sanjay taking on the role of chief technology officer.
 
 Quick Heal started at a time when there was no software product from India and little if any venture capital activity. The company received its first venture capital funding in 2010 from Sequoia, the same firm that recently boasted of nearly $3-billion payday from its investment in mobile messaging service, WhatsApp. Sequoia put in Rs 60 crore into Quick Heal, valuing the Pune-based company at Rs 600 crore at the time. That valuation has only grown in the last two years.
 
 
 

 
 ""The minimum they could expect is a Rs 1,200-crore valuation. It could be much more, depending on their actual numbers,"" said an investment banker, who declined to be identified. ""Product firms are rare but they are typically given a valuation of some multiples of revenue, but there is currently no benchmark for a company like Quick Heal in India,"" the banker said.
 
 The lack of a benchmark worries the Katkars, who are currently in the process of appointing independent directors and consultants to determine a valuation for the company. However, other IPOs such as the one for Just Dial have increased Quick Heal's confidence in its plans.

Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/reserve-bank-of-india-changes-in-gilt-auctions-seen-as-sign-of-stable-rates/articleshow/39221348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,"A couple of moves by the RBI while announcing Friday's auction for government securities (G-secs) has surprised the bond market.
 
 But dealers and analysts said that the indications, taken together, signify that the central bank is expecting a stable interest rate, at least over the next 12-18 months.
 
 On Monday , RBI announced that it will auction another lot of the new 10year paper, 8.40% GS 2024, worth Rs 9,000 crore, making it the second consecutive week of auctioning the same paper. This is probably the first time RBI has decided to auction the same paper over two successive weeks. The central bank has also moved from an uniform price auction to multiple price auction method for this Friday .
 
 Dealers said that the current yield on the new 10-year, which will be the new benchmark rate for the market, is at 8.43% per annum. In contrast, the old 10-year, which was the benchmark till last Friday , is trading at a yield of 8.71%. Ideally , the two benchmarks should not have such a large variation which at present is nearly 30 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point). “With more supply of the new 10-year in Friday's auction, this distortion will be corrected soon,“ a top dealer with a domestic bond house said.
 
 The RBI decision is also expected to increase the lifecycle of the new 10-year gilt and also the current 14-year.
 
 In all likelihood, the next 10year will be introduced only after eight-nine months, dealers said. Usually , RBI introduces two 10-year papers every year to indicate the benchmark rate that it is comfortable with. “If the RBI is extending the lifecycle of a 10-year, it is probably (another) indication that rates will be stable and hence it will not tweak with the benchmark paper,“ the dealer said.
 
 During auctions, usually the central bank also uses the uniform price method which ensures bond buyers get the gilts in the auction at an uniform yield. On the other hand, in multiple price auctions, while bidding bond houses should be more careful about the price they are willing to pay . By changing the bidding method, RBI is indicating bond players to be very careful about rates going forward, bond market players said.

Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-investors-should-assign-60-weightage-to-large-cap-stocks-in-their-portfolio-experts/articleshow/45759550.cms,m.economictimes.com,Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex, which rose 30 per cent in the calendar year 2014, looks all set to touch fresh record highs in the year 2015 and large cap stocks are likely to lead the rally, say experts.

For the year 2014, the Sensex outperformed with annual return of 30 per cent, whereas FD rates were 9 per cent and gold gave negative returns. There are typically five asset classes to choose from for retail investors, namely - equities, gold, fixed income, currency and commodities.

Equities as an asset class is likely to outperform other asset classes in the year 2015 and retail investors should look at buying quality stocks on every dip.

""For retail investors our advice is to invest wisely in equities, in 60:40 ratio - with 60% of portfolio to be assigned for large caps and 40% for mid-caps,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.

""In the year 2015 we are expecting good returns in the mid cap sector, but as risk is high, we cannot put high stakes on it. It is best to concentrate on solid stocks with great long-term growth potential and use the strategy of buying in dips,"" adds Gupta.

He further adds that mutual funds can also be a great option if direct market participation is not feasible or in case there is less risk appetite.

Considering the fact that equities are likely to outperform other asset classes, investors should remain cautious while picking stocks for their portfolio. One can look for a company that offers unique products or has a foothold in a niche market.

Consider stocks that are fundamentally solid - a strong cash position, little or no long-term debt, growing revenues, ongoing profitability, and a good growth strategy, say experts. It is also good to look for stocks that return income to investors in the form of a share repurchase program and dividends.

""Equities as an asset class are much more likely to outperform the other asset classes. Fixed income investments are being peddled by many on the basis that the RBI will cut interest rates and hence one should invest in them to capture the one-time upside to the principal,"" says Dr Vikas V Gupta, Executive Vice President at ArthVeda Fund Management Pvt. Ltd.

""However, go into equities with a consciousness of your own risk appetite and allocate a portion for the long-term. Start with a reasonable lump-sum of about 10-20 per cent of your financial corpus and then add SIPs so that in 6 months you have about 30% of the financial corpus,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that one should stick to index-oriented funds and safer large cap strategies. Small and midcaps also have a role in investors’ portfolio, but to a lesser extent.


	 

Experts across Dalal Street advise investors that they should not chase past returns; i.e. since BSE Small Cap has given 100% returns in the last one year, so one should not get enticed that that will continue in the future.

It is expected that 30 per cent CAGR in EPS is possible over the next 5 years, according to our market analysis, says Gupta. This is likely to provide very high returns over the next 5 years.

However, retail investors should develop their own understanding of equities and read up Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor before jumping lock-stock-and-barrel into equities, advise experts.

""As far as retail investors are concerned, the current set-up of Indian equity markets is unprecedented. The next three-five years look very good from the corporate growth and return perspective,"" says Vikas Khemani, Edelweiss Financial Services.

""People have to invest in equities. You can have a systematic investment plan. Obviously, one has to look at one’s own risk-reward profile. But in my opinion, for every retail investor, equity exposure has to be a significant part of their savings pool,"" he adds.

Khemani is of the view that at least 15% to 20% return over the next four-five years will come from equities. And the best part is that it is also tax free. So, equities are definitely a great asset class for any retail investor, he concludes.

Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: The dollar strength going past 89. What is your view on the rupee? 

 
Manoj Rane: The rupee is one of the few currencies which has held up during this bout of dollar strengthening. We have seen about a 3 per cent depreciation from a 60 level. It is nothing compared to what where the Yen is today. It is almost 120 and the euro is 1.23. So you have seen 10 to 15 per cent depreciation against the dollar for other currencies. In fact INR is one of the currencies which would have strengthened against most other currencies other than USD.
 
 We are so USD focus that we do react a lot to whatever weakness we see even on an intraday basis on the currency side. The good news is that 62 continues to be supported. I am not sure when I say that whether it is really good news or bad news because a certain weakness or slight weakness in the currency is in my mind good for the country, trade and our current account deficit. So to that extent I do think this level will possibly hold the currency on an around 62. I do not expect significant depreciation from here.

ET Now: From a sectoral point of view, what would you bet big on keeping the budget in mind? Do you think there is going to be any sector-impacting news, because a lot has already come in, such as the extension of duty cuts on autos till December? 

 
Anish Damania: This budget is going to drive the roadmap for the next five years. I would really like to see how the budget pans out. I want to see what the Budget does about investment expenditure. It may go about it by raising tax revenue or cutting wasteful expenditure, and allocating the amount towards investment. 

 I also want to see what the budget does about fiscal deficits and how it proposes to prime the economy. 

 These are the various steps that I am looking at. I am not comfortable with the scenario where the government will expect a higher revenue growth than the 10-11% out of the taxes. It is not going to be that easy to increase tax revenues as much as expected. So I also want to see the divestment targets of this government. I want them to be very aggressive because there is liquidity. They need to harness this global liquidity in their favour. 

 Last year, it was about Rs 276 billion. I am expecting that this year they will target close to Rs 700 billion or so in terms of divestments. I want to see those kind of numbers in the Budget. I think the areas where divestment happens are going to be the ones that will become more attractive.

  Gajendra Nagpal, CEO, Unicon Financial Solutions in a chat with ET Now talks about IPOs and anchor investors.
  
  
  Three IPOs are lined up for today. Some of the anchor investors are pure hedge funds, who sell 10 days after they buy. So, should you look at anchor investors and when you look at them, should you rather prefer investors who do not buy and sell?
   
  Obviously, these funds have some kind of a legacy, some kind of a credibility in the market place. If there are better names on the side of anchor investors, then one tends to feel more comfortable. A similar case applies elsewhere also. If there is a great guy getting into a particular product, you do not mind getting into it because the great guy has got it but if the hedge funds are, the ones who are becoming anchor investors and at times we also hear that these are back-to-back arrangements from the promoter group within the fund, they are IAR, which are absolutely predetermined. There are all kinds of things that happen that we keep hearing about from time to time, so one has to be very careful. If the quality anchor investors are there, definitely it is more comforting from the retail investor’s standpoint.

"Thanks to SEBI, shareholders will have access to critical information from the next fiscal",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/thanks-to-sebi-shareholders-will-have-access-to-critical-information-from-the-next-fiscal/articleshow/16397390.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Thanks to SEBI, shareholders will have access to critical information from the next fiscal","SEBI vide its recent circular has made it mandatory for top 100 listed companies (by market capitalization) to report certain critical information as part of their business responsibility. 

 This includes how much the company is spending on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a percentage of its net profit, the number of stakeholders' complaints received and resolved, details of any pending case filed by stakeholder against any unfair trade practice, irresponsible advertising or anti-competitive behaviour adopted by the company. 

 This will enable the shareholders to have a better understanding of the manner in which their companies' function and adopt responsible business practices. 

 The circular dated August 13 exhorts the companies to follow the national voluntary guidelines on social, environmental and economic responsibility that have been formulated by ministry of corporate affairs in July 2011. 

 Companies are expected to share information like number of employees hired on temporary or contractual basis, any legal notices received from pollution control boards and number of consumer complaints pending at the end of the fiscal. 

 While most leading companies like L&T, HUL, Dr Reddy's Labs, Tata Motors, ITC and ICICI Bank are already publishing a separate sustainability report along with their annual reports, the circular will make it compulsory for all top 100 companies to report their responsibility initiatives and also bring in certain uniformity in their reporting. 

 ""It is a step in the right direction by the SEBI. However, it is not a surprise. The industry knew that something like this was coming,"" said the head of CSR division in a Nifty company. Most of the companies must be in the process of making themselves ready for such reporting. 

 If a company has to follow it, it has to start early as there has to be a system put in place and it is an initiative where the whole organization has to be involved, he added. 

 Under the structure that has been suggested, the companies also have to provide the details of the director responsible for implementation of the business responsibility policies. In case a company is not abiding by any of the principles to be reported, it has to explain the reasons of its failure to do so. 

 The Companies bill 2011, which is making it mandatory for certain companies to report their responsibility initiatives, is still pending approval from the parliament. Meanwhile SEBI through its circular has made business responsibility reporting mandatory for at least the large companies. 

 The circular shall be applicable with effect from fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2012. Sustainability experts expect the regulation to be progressively made applicable to all companies listed on the stock exchanges. The national voluntary guidelines are already applicable to all Indian companies including multinationals as well as small and medium enterprises. 

 The companies that already submit sustainability reports to their stakeholders based on internationally accepted reporting frameworks have to only map the principles contained in the national voluntary guidelines to their existing sustainability reports.

A consortium of state-owned insurers led, by New India Assurance, has emerged as the frontrunner for the national carrier’s business, while the private sector has rallied behind a group led by ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The insurance contract for the flag carrier’s 105-strong fleet comes up for renewal on October 1 at an estimated premium of about $25 million. 

 
Experts said the New India Assuranceled consortium has United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and National Insurance as co-insurers. The other group has ICICI Lombard General Insurance as lead insurer and Reliance General and HDFC Ergo as co-insurers. 

 The insurance companies ET spoke with on the matter declined to comment. However, a senior executive at a staterun insurer said the New India Assurance-led consortium was ahead in the race. 

 According to industry executives, aviation premiums have increased following arise in mishaps, pushing up the bill for insurers. For instance, in 2013 when the market had softened, Air India paid a premium of $23 million. This was lower by over $1 million than the premium in 2010 when an Air India Express jet crashed in Mangalore killing 158 people. 

 General insurers led by Reliance General that had provided cover to Air India in 2010 had to pay Rs 350-400 crore in compensation claims. Most of the claim money came from international reinsurers who dictate rates depending on the state of the market. 

 Air India’s current insurance policy, issued by New India Assurance, includes a $9.5-billion hull cover and a combined single liability of $1.5 billion. 

 Hull all-risk insurance covers any damage to the body of the aircraft caused by an accident, while war risk, part of hull cover, insures against war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. In addition, the insurance covers liability toward passengers and covers legal protection against suits. 

 A series of aviation disasters this year—the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in March, the crash of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft in Ukraine in July and that of an Air Algeria plane in Mali in the same month—have turned aviation insurers wary.

 The Reserve Bank of India has on Wednesday released a market borrowing calendar stating that state governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, will sell about Rs 95,000-1,05,000 crore worth of bonds between January and March next year through central bank auction system. 

 With this higher-than-expected capital market fund mop-ups, investors including insurers, pension funds would be flooded with excess supply of securities. Markets were expecting state bond sales in the range of Rs 65,000-75,000 crore in the fourth quarter. 

 “The amount of proposed bond sales is higher than market expectations,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, analyst, interest rates, SBI DFHI Primary Dealers. “The excess supply along with other securities will help future investors to earn higher.” 

 “Issuers may have to fork out higher rates to woo investors as the yield curve would remain elevated,” he said. By March, markets could also see Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore worth of ‘discom’ bonds coming out of state-owned power distribution companies under the bailout scheme christened as “Uday”. Moreover, tax free bonds are already attracting retail investors with a cumulative Rs 40,000 crore issuances expected by financial yearend. The central government too will issue about Rs 80,000-85,000 crore routine sovereign bonds between January and February, dealers said. 

 Excess supply will lead to rise in bond yields pushing prices down in the existing bonds. 

 New tax free bonds may now have to offer higher rates as those are priced in link with the benchmark bond yield. State bonds are now yielding 8.25-8.27% half yearly, which about 50 basis points higher than the benchmark sovereign yield. 

 During October-December quarter such bond sales was in the range Rs 75,000-80,000. About six months ago, for the first time, the central bank had issued a tentative calendar for selling state securities in line with central government bonds. In the July-September quarter, 10 states and one of the union territories had sold Rs 45,000-50,000 crore bonds. State bonds are mostly of 10-year maturities while states like Gujarat and Karnataka have introduced five-year papers too.

Pankaj Pandey: Largely if you look at there are some segments which do well at a certain point in time and then there are certain segments which become a drag so similarly for example it looks like that metal as a pack might be a sort of a drag on the company.  	Earlier you had oil and gas which was posing challenges for the company, but largely if you look at what we are expecting is that in this particular quarter things would remain soft for the company and it is largely a soft quarter.  	But in terms of order inflows, it will be similar to what has happened in the last quarter so about 11500 odd crores that is what the company has disclosed, so we are expecting about 4 to 5% top line growth and a similar bottom line growth with same margins.  	The key takeaway going forward will be that over the next three to six months, we would expect a lot of announcements to happen on the ordering side which is where we would expect this company to do far better, which is why we would expect that probably the demand would continue to hold its guidance of 15% order growth and we are expecting a similar sort of top line growth and a shade below margin and a shade below profit growth.

Lessons from Inox Wind listing: Firms with smaller businesses can unlock value by separate listing,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/lessons-from-inox-wind-listing-firms-with-smaller-businesses-can-unlock-value-by-separate-listing/articleshow/46871127.cms,m.economictimes.com,Lessons from Inox Wind listing: Firms with smaller businesses can unlock value by separate listing,"MUMBAI: The strong listing gain of Inox Wind on Thursday shows that companies that have smaller and less profitable businesses — to which Street may not be giving higher valuation -- can unlock value by listing them separately. Inox Wind’s IPO was oversubscribed 35 times. It closed at Rs 438 — 35% higher than its offer price on Thursday. Another example is of Marico Kaya, a subsidiary of Marico which was listed in July 2014. The stock has so far gained 750%. Intellect Design, a subsidiary of Polaris Consulting Services, has gained 70% since its listing in December 2014.
 
 Spinning off the less profitable business once it turns around and becomes self-sustainable not only creates value for the shareholders of the new listed entity but also for the shareholders of the parent company. ETIG has identified some of the companies that may see a potential separate listing of the smaller or less profitable businesses.
 
 
Eicher Motors
 
 For Eicher Motors, separate listing of its commercial vehicle business could be a game changer. The bike business may be around one-third of the top-line, but contributed 90% to the entire profit in CY14. According to analysts, the bike business will grow at least 60% for the next two years (it grew by 100% in CY14) and should get a P/E multiple of 25 on FY17 earnings.
 
 This means, the bike business on a standalone basis is valued at Rs 36,000 crore. Considering this, the commercial vehicle business is valued at only Rs 6,500 crore (the current market capitalisation of Rs 42,500 crore lessRs 36,000 crore of bike business valuation). The commercial vehicle business, which is a joint venture with Swedish auto giant Volvo, gives two-thirds of Eicher’s total sales and has already started to show a turnaround.
 
 

HSIL
 
 HSIL is the biggest player in the sanitary ware business with close to 60% market share and the highest margin in the industry. But, it has a market capitalisation less than its peer – Cera Sanitaryware. This is because HSIL also has a glass business which was loss-making till a few quarters ago with a debt of close to Rs 800 crore.
 
 In the glass packaging business it is one of the top two players in the country. It became loss-making two years ago after the industry capacity increased amid the demand slowdown. However, now the glass industry has consolidated with only few players and the demand is improving. HSIL’s glass business has shown a strong turnaround. The recent institutional placement will bring down the debt significantly. In the past, the management has mentioned about demerging the two businesses.
 
 
Tata Global Beverages
 
 Since the time Tata Global Beverages and Starbucks signed the joint venture in India, Tata Global Beverages’ market capitalisation has remained almost stagnant. Analysts are not giving the full valuation to the Starbucks business, which has already opened close to 70 stores and 70% of that in the last one year.
 
 The company is expected to have 400 Starbucks outlets by FY18 and achieve breakeven. Once that happens, there could be a separate listing of Starbucks. Jubilant FoodWorks with close to 800 stores is valued at over Rs 10,000 crore and Tata Global Beverages together with its tea, coffee and Starbucks businesses is valued at Rs 9,300 crore.

 Nasdaq’s entry into the India market comes at a time when the US-based stock exchange is looking to expand its footprint in emerging markets including India. Industry insiders believe that the exchange is hoping to cash-in on the optimism fueling the technology sector and get manystart-ups access capital by helping them get listed at the stock market. 

 ""We look forward to the long-term opportunities our presence in Bangalore will provide for us,"" said Robert Frojd, regional manager, Southeast Asia for NASDAQ OMX. 

 Details of the management at the India office were not mentioned in the press release. An email was sent to the Nasdaq this morning, before US working hours. 

 Nasdaq first opened its Bangalore office in 2001 and was present until the year 2009. However, in the eight years Nasdaq was present on the ground, the exchange could not get any Indian firm listed on its stock exchange, according to data from Dealogic and the Nasdaq’s website. 

 This was primarily because experts believed there very few incentives for the companies to get listed, with the problems getting exacerbated by the the many regulatory bottlenecks ahead of the India firms to get listed in the US. 

 However, this time many believe the exchange could find success and get firms access to capital as the exchange may have learnt from its mistakes during the first stint. 

 Kiran Karnik, a former president of India’s software industry association body Nasscom said the decision to set up an office in India, after having gone through a turmoil, is an optimistic step. 

 ""For startups in Bangalore, especially the one’s that are growing fast, this is a great opportunity to get to Nasdaq,"" he said. 

 Over the past few years, Nasdaq has been expanding its presence beyond the US and European markets by wooing listings from companies in Southeast Asia. It has listed 8 Indian companies, including pharmaceutical firm Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, ICICI Bank and Sify Technologies . 

 India’s second largest software firm Infosys had moved its listing from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext's New York Stock Exchange in 2012 to increase its access to European investors. Infosys was replaced by Facebook on the Nasdaq-100 index.

NBFC Indostar plans to hit market with rs 1K crore public issue in June '16,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nbfc-indostar-plans-to-hit-market-with-rs-1k-crore-public-issue-in-june-16/articleshow/49639916.cms,m.economictimes.com,NBFC Indostar plans to hit market with rs 1K crore public issue in June '16,"MUMBAI: Non-banking finance company Indostar Capital Finance, promoted by Everstone Capital, has kicked off the process of launching an initial public offer of Rs 1,000 crore. Investors have invited banks to pitch for the mandate this week, said two people close to the development. 

 On the back of growing investor demand for financial services companies, the promoters see an IPO as the best option to raise capital. If the company files for an IPO, it will become the first sizeable nonbanking financial company (NBFC) to list in the last four years. 

 Founded in 2010 by Everstone Capital, Indostar provides long term funding to Indian businesses and infrastructure projects. ""The presentations from bankers will be made this week. A few banks will be appointed soon,"" said one of the persons. 

 ""Apart from four global banks, a couple of domestic banks will be appointed. The issue is expected to be launched around June 2016,"" said the second person. 

 Everstone Capital managing partner Dhanpal Jhaveri declined to comment. 

 Last year, Ashmore Capital, one of the founding partners of Indostar, exited the business by selling its stake to Everstone Capital and ACPI. Apart from Everstone and Goldman Sachs, Indostar is owned by Beacon India Private Equity Fund, ACPI and China Development Finance's investment arm CDIB. 

 Indostar's loan portfolio stood at Rs 3,375 crore on 31 March, according to an October ratings release by Care India. The company's net worth is more than Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Having focused on wholesale lending, the company is now increasingly looking at small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to diversify its loan portfolio. On March 31, around 30 per cent of loans were to the real estate sector, 66.5 per cent to corporate financing and 2.9 per cent was given out against shares. The company's vehicle finance portfolio was 0.2 per cent of the total. This is one reason why Indostar is able to maintain a healthy portfolio with gross nonperforming assets at 0.77 per cent and net non-performing assets at 0.064 per cent of total loans, experts said. 

 Indostar clocked around Rs 149 crore in post-tax profit in FY15, up from Rs 112 crore in the previous year. This growth was achieved on the back of total income of Rs 528 crore.

ET Now: What is your take on the auto stocks? How are you dissecting the game between four-wheelers and two-wheelers? Between four-wheelers too, it is a divide between CVs and passenger vehicles. Your thoughts? 

 
Rajat Rajgarhia: The top stocks in auto right now are very clear. They are Maruti and Tata Motors. As of Maruti — while the stock is at its all-time high — the volumes have been almost flat for the last four years. We think that over the next three-four years when the volume moves from the current 1.2 million to close to 2 million, the operating leverage along with a stable currency can do wonders to its earnings, and similarly, to the stock. 

 Same is the case with Tata Motors. JLR continues to hold on well, but the domestic business has been a drag. It will return with a big bang over the years to come. It means not just a higher earnings, but also a higher valuation for the stock. 

 M&M has also reported the July month volumes, with both UVs and tractors showing a decline. At this point of time, it would definitely not be on the priority list, because we will have to see how, at what point of time, both of their businesses start doing well. Generally the stock will only do well when you will see both these units growing into double digits. But that is not happening anytime in the near future. 

 To me, both Tata Motors and Maruti will keep on dragging for some more time.

"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-move-on-fast-track-rights-fpos-to-help-government-in-disinvestment-of-state-owned-companies/articleshow/42843402.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies","MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi is planning to allow more listed companies to raise funds through ‘fast track’ follow-on public offers (FPOs) and rights issues, provided issuers fulfil certain conditions. The proposed move could also make it easier for the government to divest stake in some of the state-owned companies.
 
 Companies having a free-float market capitalisation above Rs 250 crore will be able take this route, according to a regulatory official. This will make more than 300 listed companies eligible for the fast track fundraising option. Apart from meeting existing criteria, companies will also have to fulfil additional conditions – like, promoters will have to compulsorily subscribe to rights entitlement, the stock should not have been suspended from trading in the past three years due to regulatory violations, no conflict of interest should prevail between lead manager and issuer and promoters, and the company should not have settled any violation of securities law through consent mechanism.
 
 The regulator is keen to further reduce the time for processing offer documents for companies with good track record. At present, compliant listed companies satisfying certain specific conditions and having a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore are allowed to access the primary market in a time effective manner. Such companies can proceed with FPOs and rights issue by filing a copy of prospectus with stock exchanges and Sebi. They are not required to file draft offer document for Sebi comments.
 
 What is now being proposed is making rules simpler for a larger number of companies. “The fast track route will significantly shorten the fund-raising process for companies,” said Praveen Chakarvarty, a member of Sebi’s primary market advisory committee and former managing director of BNP Paribas.
 
 “Typically, for a company wishing to raise money through an FPO or rights issue (with Sebi review), the timeline is about 5-7 months, which is very long in the current environment,” said Sudhir Bassi, executive director-capital markets of the law firm Khaitan & Co. “In order to make FPO and rights issue more popular modes of raising funds by corporates, it would be useful if Sebi relaxes the eligibility requirements for fast track issuers.”
 
 The new rule on fast track issuances is expected to cover all PSUs, irrespective of their market capitalisation – a step that could facilitate the government's divestment programme. On the proposal on making it incumbent on promoters to subscribe to their rights entitlement, Chakarvarty said, “This is in line with international investing practices.”
 
 In 2012, the regulator had reduced the threshold of free-float market capitalisation for issuers accessing the market through fast-track FPOs and rights issues to Rs 3,000 crore from Rs 5,000 crore. Sebi had introduced the concept of fast track issues in 2007. The regulator is not in favour of making the fast track route available to all companies as the process involves restricted due diligence.
 
 But some experts feel all publicly traded companies should be able to avail this facility. “All listed companies should be allowed to use the fast track route. However, to be on the conservative side, the current threshold of market cap should definitely be lowered,” said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database. “If a company is already listed and trading is taking place on a daily basis, then there is enough information available in the public domain… why, then, should an FPO or rights issue require a detailed offer document and a Sebi approval?”

Sandeep Wagle: I would say the Nifty is in a corrective mode in the short term. By short term, I mean the next day or two. A move towards 7400-7430, which is a very strong support area, cannot be ruled out. We are playing for that. 

 In case it does not happen, we will cut off the short position on Monday morning. But the weekly view is quite positive. The pattern till now suggests at most a small correction of 100 points. At those levels we would want to go long. 

 I would want to be stock-specific. So if the Nifty finds support at 7430-7400 levels, then I would look at covering a short position and going long, stressing on playing stock-specific.

ET Now: You are positive on Britannia Industries and, in the past, you have liked the stock at Rs 3,100 level. Is Britannia price to perfection?  Mayuresh Joshi: Britannia Industries' valuations are close to 36-odd times FY17 earnings. We believe that it should continue to remain a part of portfolio on few counts. The return on capital (ROC) has showed tremendous improvement from lower levels to around 54 per cent.
 
 The return on equity (ROE) too is at a very decent level at 50 per cent-odd. If you look at the cash convergence cycle, the company is sitting on decent cash at the current juncture. In addition, the cost optimisation efforts that the company is probably taking to margin expansion, I am not of the opinion that the margins would stay at 14-14.5 per cent.
 
 The numbers have been aided by too many factors in the June quarter results. So, low raw material, freight and fuel costs have probably propped up margins. But decent margin expansion has to happen with the cost optimisation plan and premiumisation story — the cookie market — that will still play out. So, in my opinion, investors who have bought the stock at lower levels should continue holding on to it for 10 years though valuations at the current juncture do not warrant a fresh buy at the current level.

Mitesh Thacker: So on the market, you have probably defined the range. The broader range is still about 8,050-8,100 on the upside to about 7,700. Today morning, I talked about the possibility of bounce back happening given the fact that Nifty was on the hourly closing charts, closer to about 7,700-7,690 which was the earlier swing low. The Bank Nifty was at important weekly pivot levels of around 16,200. The bounceback has started. I was expecting it to be choppy bounce back but this appears to be slightly stronger than what my initial expectation was.
 
 You might see a subdued move in the coming one or two days around 7,850 but, overall the next level on the upside should be around 7,925 to about 7,950. With some choppiness in the next two-three sessions or four sessions we might be trading around 7,950-odd levels.

ET Now: What are your thoughts on real estate sector?  N Jayakumar: Everything is a function of the price at which it is trading and real estate has come off quite dramatically. Most of these stocks are quoting very close to what is the equivalent of book. Three months ago there was no off take in the same real-estate. To a large extent that has changed and things are happening at least in metros. In places like Mumbai, South Delhi and Gurgaon there is a fair amount of activity happening which has allowed the real-estate companies to monetise some of their assets.  So, as companies like DLF and Unitech continues to monetise their land banks and keep reducing their debt then there will be a scenario where some of these companies regardless of the external environment will find a base at current levels and could surprise on the upside as liquidity and interest rates ease off in April-May.  ET Now: Would banks be a good bet to put your money in?  N Jayakumar: Banks are the first space that get affected by interest rates. Evaluations and the bond yields are indicating that somewhere along the line the markets are sensing a cut in interest rates and that might be a force cut in interest rates but it will need to have an impact that brings in further rate cuts.  We are far far aggressively placed in terms of interest rates right now which is only hurting growth. Somewhere along the line the RBI will have to cut rates and the banks therefore will bounce-off their lows pretty aggressively indicating further rate cuts. My own sense is that the downside is limited but there could be upsides evolving even from here. Private sectors banks like Yes Bank given their lower propensity to have NPAs will actually be much bigger beneficiaries than the public sector banks.

  MUMBAI: In a long-awaited top management succession planning exercise, corporate giant Larsen and Toubro on Friday appointed K Venkataraman as its CEO and Managing Director, while its current chief A M Naik would remain Executive Chairman for the next five years.
  
  Naik currently holds the position of Chairman and MD at the group, a major player in engineering, manufacturing, construction and a host of other businesses including technology and financial services.
  
  The L&T's board of directors has decided to bifurcate the roles of Chairman and Managing Director in a major top management rejig, which would become effective from April 1.
  
  As per the new structure, Venkataraman would assume the position of Chief Executive Officer and MD, while Naik would assume the post of Executive Chairman.
  
  Krishnamurthi Venkataramanan is currently Whole-time Director and President (Hydrocarbon) and had joined L&T as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in 1969. He was elevated to L&T Board in the year 1995.

  While Venkataramanan would be responsible for the businesses of L&T, Naik would focus on completing the portfolio restructuring, institutionalising the IC (Independent Company) structure, mentoring and developing the leadership team and future leaders, the group said.
  
  Naik, a towering corporate leader of the country, had joined L&T as a Junior Engineer in 1965 and rapidly rose to senior positions -- moving from General Manager to Managing Director and CEO, culminating in his appointment as Chairman in December 2003.
  
  L&T said it has undertaken an exercise, named 'Lakshya', to simplify its portfolio and has created 10 independent companies and seven subsidiaries in order to bring focus, autonomy and accountability. It had also engaged services of global strategy firms for the same.
  
  However, changes in the economic environment has led to L&T undertaking a mid-term review of strategic plan, which is now under finalisation, it said in a statement after today's board meeting.
  
  ""In line with the vision of the company to become an Indian Multinational as also looking at the current global competitive environment, it needs to develop leaders who will manage the company, going forward,"" it added.
  
  Accordingly, the board decided that there was a need for continuity and requested Naik to continue for a period of five years as Executive Chairman of the Group.
  
  ""I am honoured with the responsibility that the board has placed on me. I am also happy that A M Naik's guidance will continue to be available,"" Venkataraman said.
  
  The company said its board was confident that its decision was in the best interest of all stakeholders.

ET Now: We may have hit a fresh high on the Nifty, but somehow market internals do not inspire too much of confidence. Your view?
 
 
Mayuresh Joshi: In view of what has transpired over the past few weeks and months, and given the exuberance that we have seen in the market, our take is that the markets have done more or less enough from a short- to medium-term perspective.
 
 In the post-budget speech, the exchequer was very clear in terms of policy implementation when he said that it will take at least a quarter or more to frame policies and implement them. So, keeping this in mind, if the markets are assuming that a lot of policy action will happen over the next few months, they would be wrong because it is unlikely to happen.
 
 Secondly, the inherent risk that the markets face is the monsoons. The next two months will be critical as to how the monsoons pan out. In case there is some shortage in terms of the overall spread of rains across the country, you might have your inflationary pressures peaking out.
 
 Thirdly, a lot will depend on how the global scenario plays out. Also crucial is what the FED does over the next two to three months. These are something that world markets are watching out for.
 
 So, if one considers all these factors, one would see that the only thing that is left for the markets from short- to medium-term perspective is the corporate earnings. Corporate earnings are going to be a little bit subdued for this quarter and for two-three quarters to come. You are not going to see an exponential rise both in top line and bottom line for most companies.
 
 There would hardly be any exponential growth and even if there is, it would be very stock-specific.
 
 Markets will trade in a range. Even in terms of valuations from an FY15 perspective, we are trading at a fair valuation. So, our take is that the Nifty will find it very difficult to breach the 7900-mark. It might possibly stay in a range of 7250-7900 over the next two to three months.

ET Now: Unfortunately it is wobbly market scenario. Otherwise, we would have seen positive banking reaction maybe? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: What the SEBI has announced is positive for the banking sector. Even the conversion from debt to equity, because the apex body has tinkered with the pricing formula, is quote positive for the sector. We have seen the infamous case of Kingfisher where banks had to finally convert their debt into equity. But, the price they got was meaningless as the ruling market price was significantly lower. It was based on the earlier formula. 

 So, this will give banks tremendous leeway in getting prices which should be more realistic. 

 Now, as we have also realised that the domestic stock market especially from midcaps is very narrow, therefore, taking the six-month average price tends to be misleading at times. 

 But one thing has to be keep in mind that banks cannot hold more than 30 per cent in any company at present. Hence, that needs to be changed. Banks must be given maximum leeway to stakes in in companies and change the managements. 

 Changing managements is critical especially in times when asset quality is such a huge issue and when there are many cases in which managements really have siphoned out money. They do not really deserve to be managing the businesses. Therefore, it is critical that banks get an appropriate price when they convert their debt into equity and they are able to remove existing managements to get new persons on board. It would thus raise some hopes of preserving the asset quality of the underlying loan. 

 ET Now: You may get assets at equity valuations; you may even get it at an attractive price, but that will not change the complexion of the business. A bad asset is a bad asset; the way a bad asset could be revived is that you need to restructure the whole process and you need to really infuse some cash flows. This new formula does not take care of the revival plan. Am I right? 

 

 Hemindra Hazari: True, but that problem can be fixed only by improvement in macro-economy. I really do not, I am not at all optimistic that especially after this Budget that we are going to see any significant revival. Having said that, what is critical is that if banks hold a significant chunk of equity, they can leverage that position to remove the existing management. It is because in a lot of cases, it is the management which remain responsible the poor asset quality. 

 Either they have taken commercial decisions, which were not all viable or they have siphoned out huge amounts of cash from the projects. 

 A lot of the infrastructure projects are highly inflate the cost and banks anyway have to take a hit. Therefore, it is better that they take a hit and remove the management and replace a more stable, confident and reputable management than to have the existing management still in place. Then you are just throwing good money after bad.

The bank is likely to finalise the bond sales on Tuesday as it is looking to obtain a better pricing, said a top official from the bank. 

 ""We are yet to conclude on the final issuance deal,"" M S Raghavan, chairman and managing director, IDBI Bank, told ET, confirming the move. The bank may do away with the issuance if it doesn’t get the right pricing. ""We have already received bids,"" the CMD added. 

 The interest rate is apparently set at 8.74%, but the bank chairman has not yet approved it. SBI Capital Market is the sole arranger of the issuance, three people familiar with the matter said. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is likely to be the largest investor in the issuance. 

 Ratings agency Crisil has assigned an AA+/Stable rating to the bond issuance. 

 The central provident fund body receives interest payment in a wide range of about Rs 5,000-8,000 crore on Special Deposit Scheme, launched by the government in July 1975, on the first day of every calendar year. 

 Earlier, in September last year, IDBI Bank mopped up Rs 1,000 crore by issuing infrastructure bonds. The coupon or interest rate was at 9.5% with similar maturity. This time, the bank would be better-off with cheaper rates as the benchmark 10-year government bond yield is now hovering 64-68 basis points lower compared to September. 

 About a month ago, country’s third-largest private sector lender, Axis Bank, collectedRs 5,705 crore by selling infrastructure bonds offering 8.85% rate. Those were rated as triple-A by CRISIL & ICRA. India’s largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank, too sold infra bonds for about Rs 3,900 crore in early September. Last year, RBI facilitated long-term lending in infrastructure and affordable or low cost housing.

  In his long and chequered career as a politician and administrator, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is unlikely to have faced a more daunting task than finalising this Budget. The competing pressures on him were intense. Fiscal deficit was way over the numbers projected in last Budget. Inflation, which had cooled in the early months of 2012, was again raising its head. Investment and consequently growth had slowed down to about 7%. Clearly, what was needed was a budget that attempted a fiscal course correction while giving an impetus to growth - itself an onerous task.

  Complicating the scenario further were the setbacks in the recent assembly elections and growing dissonance between the Congress and its allies on various policies. This meant that the political room for big bang reforms was clearly limited. Given these constraints, the finance minister has managed to perform a minor miracle. He has admirably balanced the various pulls and pressures and yet delivered a budget for growth by maintaining consumption, reviving investment, boosting capital markets and widening the tax net. 
  
  The FM is looking at capping the fiscal deficit at 5.1% for FY13. This seems realistic. His positive steps include putting FRBM implementation back on the agenda, capping the subsidy at 2% of the GDP, with the promise of reducing it to 1.7%. Also, if the government is able to deliver on the FM's promise to direct cash transfers using the UID mechanism, it would help plug leakages. All the moves on the infrastructure sector - from doubling the amount that can be raised through tax-free infrastructure bonds to 60,000 to customs duty relief for import of fuels like coal - could restart the much-needed investments in this sector. 
  
  The proposals on the capital markets side - the cut in Securities Transaction Tax, incentives under the Rajiv Gandhi equity scheme for first-time investors, and making electronic format mandatory for 10% of IPOs worth over 10 crore - are again small but directionally important steps. The raising of service tax rate to 12% was a bit of surprise, but perhaps unavoidable given the need to raise resources. But the move to a negative list will go a long way towards simplifying the process. His proposals on avoidance of tax evasion are very significant and could have long-term positive implications for the economy. 
  
  Admittedly, there were no 'big bang', headline grabbing reforms in the Budget. But the FM has done enough to rekindle growth and, more importantly, he has done it in an understated, credible manner that is unlikely to raise any political hackles and thus has a greater chance of success.

The company that’s being valued at around $150 million, will look to sell up to 40 per cent stake. 

 “The company is in talks with global PE funds to raise money. Currently, the due diligence is on,” said a person involved in the deal. Kiran Bhupatiraju, chief executive officer of Laila Nutraceuticals, did not respond to emailed queries and calls on his mobile. 

 Laila Nutraceuticals is part of the Laila Group with business interests across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, ayurvedic products, sugar, paper, finance, hospitality, real estate and education. It manufactures and exports herbal extracts that are key ingredients for the dietary and nutritional supplements. 

 The firm is largely dependent on three key herbal extracts -boswellia, garcinia and gymnema - deriving over 95 per cent of its revenues from these products. Founded in 2005 by Dr G Ganga Raju, son of Gokaraju Ranga Raju, the former chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Party in Andhra Pradesh, Laila Nutra had revenues of around Rs 80 crore in FY 2014. The company is being valued at around ten times its sales at around $150 million, or Rs 900 crore. 

 “The company will sell around 40 per cent stake to private equity funds. It is also open to a strategic partnership. However, the strategic interest of multinationals in Indian nutra makers is low at this point of time,” a senior PE fund manager said. Laila Nutra has its manufacturing facility in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, and supplies these ingredients to its overseas clients such as US-based PL Thomas Inc and Interhealth Nutraceuticals Inc.

Negotiations are on between leading industry body India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), the state’s nodal agency for industrial development, for allotment of land to the trade. IBJA, consisting of 1,100 members, is proposing to shift either lock stock and barrel from the crowded Zaveri Bazaar to the city of Panvel, close to the proposed new international airport, or two nearby locations.  	The discussions began after IBJA approached chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who, in turn, asked MIDC to consider allotment of land around Panvel. “We have requested for around 500 acres to be allotted in Panvel, and will take a call based on the amount of land which can be earmarked for setting up a jewellery park, knowledge centre and accompanying facilities,” said Ketan Shroff, spokesperson, IBJA.  	Bhushan Gagrani, CEO, MIDC, told ET that Pavel may be short of land. “The association has approached us a couple of times. It’s a good idea but we don’t have 500 acres available in Panvel. Therefore, we have suggested two alternatives to them (IBJA) – Roha Mangaon where we are currently acquiring land, and Khopoli.”  	Currently, scores of jewellery manufacturers, gold refiners and bullion traders, operate out of the highly congested market at Zaveri Bazaar, where an estimated 40% of India’s gold trade takes place each year. “It’s highly inconvenient in terms of logistics, security, well-being of workers and ease of doing business. This has made it imperative for us to consider a new location,” added Shroff.  	At Khopoli, MIDC has notified the site for acquisition and setting up of an industrial zone. However, it has not started the land acquisition process as yet. Apart from these locations, the association has also suggested a separate site, also in Khopoli, to MIDC for land allotment.  	“We are currently considering all three locations. If the association is fine with Roha Mangaon site, we can allot the land in the next six months; other places may take longer. And, this will be allotted to them at compensation as per our norms,” Gagrani added.  	Zaveri Bazar is the country’s oldest jewellery market. The oldest outlet, Narandas Manordas, is over 200 years old. It also houses showrooms of reputed jewellers like TBZ The Original, Dwarkadas Chandumal, UTZ, etc.  	Until six-seven years ago Zaveri Bazaar accounted for 65% of the country’s bullion trade. But traders moved to Ahmedabad, India’s bullion capital, when the Maharashtra state government imposed stamp duty of 0.1% on gold and silver in addition to an octroi of 0.1% on gold and 2% on silver, according to Shroff. Ahmedabad imposes neither octroi nor stamp duty.  	Making Panvel a possible hub will do away with octroi and help the Mumbai Metropolitan region to reclaim the status of bullion capital. "
Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear. Do you agree?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/warren-buffett-once-said-that-gold-is-a-way-of-going-long-on-fear-do-you-agree/articleshow/48260855.cms,m.economictimes.com,Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear. Do you agree?,"By Sahil Kapoor
 
 The world market was awash with a swarm of gold bugs after the financial crisis of 2008. Gold bugs are advocates of investments in Gold as a safe haven and a guard against financial Armageddon, hyperinflation, currency collapses and geopolitical troubles.
 
 A few years ago, gold bugs argued the precious metal was a can't-miss investment given the ultra-loose monetary policies around the world and the prospect of higher inflation.
 
 However, you can't find many gold bugs as the metal prices have taken a big tumble. The cumulative returns since 2010 for gold HAS almost BEEN nil compared to a return of 70 per cent by Dow Jones Industrial Average and 57 per cent by BSE S&P Sensex.
 
 The current outlook on gold is reflected in this quote by the legendary investor Warren Buffett.
 
 ""Gold is a way of going long on fear, and it has been a pretty good way of going long on fear from time to time. But, you really have to hope people become more afraid in a year or two years than they are now. And if they become more afraid, you make money, if they become less afraid, you lose money, but the gold itself doesn't produce anything.""
 
 One of the principal arguments in favour of Gold at the turn of the decade was the impending hyperinflation which would follow the massive money printing done across the world. This world economy is struggling with continued threat of deflation in Eurozone, anemic growth in Japan, the US and most of the commodity producers, causing benign inflation scenario.
 
 The steep decline in oil prices has added to this fall in inflation and has reduced inflation expectations further. Gold has historically performed fairly well in period of excessive inflation. The period of 2001 to 2008 saw gold multiply about three times, largely led by inflationary outlook and a weakening US Dollar.
 
 Post the financial crisis of 2008, Gold bugs advocated in favour of the ""catastrophe metal"" as a hedge against the then probable collapse of the US Dollar as a reserve currency. The adoption of Euro as a secondary reserve currency gained prominence and supported the gold prices further.
 
 The emergence of Chinese central bank as a buyer of gold to prop up its gold reserves created further demand for the metal amid the sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone in 2011 to 2012. As we stand today, the dynamics supporting the gold price have changed. They changed a few years ago when as a directional bet, we expected gold prices to soften to $1,000.
 
 Hyperinflation, safe-haven and a reserve currency - all these arguments seems to have taken a back seat for now. We expect these factors to continue to weigh on gold prices. A strong dollar and bearishness across commodities are what's really driving gold prices.
 
 
Gold losing safe-haven appeal:
 
 Despite all the global economic uncertainty, ""Gold's safe heaven thesis"" is not really playing out. Gold prices have remained relatively muted in response to the Greek debt crisis, which is an indication that markets have priced in the risk of sovereign default. Over the years, Gold has proved itself to be a safe-haven. However, that appeal has always been short-lived and dependent on the long-term effect of each risk-aversion episode.
 
 
Dollar Strengthening: 
 
 US Dollar has strengthened, largely led by a deep devaluating of Euro, JPY and GBP. This is a product of fresh credit easing introduced by Eurozne, Abenomics in Japan and continued easing in the UK. Many commodity-producing currencies have declined along with oil prices, giving a further fillip to US Dollar.
 
 Gold is priced in US Dollar and has an inverted correlation to it. The effect can be seen on gold prices. US Dollar Index (a measure of the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies) has appreciated 35 per cent since 2011 and in the same time period, Gold prices have declined more than 50 per cent from their peak of $1900.
 
 
Largest Gold Short Position in the COT Report's History:
 
 Speculators are holding the smallest net-bullish bet on gold since the US government data begins in 2006. Latest COT Report shows speculative gold shorts rose to just under 99,000 contracts - the largest level in the report's history. Additionally, the percentage of speculative shorts rose above 45 per cent, which is another COT report record.
 
 
Chinese appetite for gold mellowing down:
 
 The central People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced last week that bullion holdings rose to 1,658 tonnes as of the end of June, from 1,054 tonnes in April 2009. Despite the tonnage increase, Gold now accounts for 1.65 per cent of China's total foreign exchange reserves, against 1.8 per cent in June 2009. The number was much less than the perception of China holding more than 3,000 tonnes, which shows Chinese appetite for Gold is mellowing down.
 
 
ETF Selling: 
 
 ETF holdings have dropped considerably from their 2012 record high of 2,900 tonnes - roughly falling by a third. Gold ETFs worldwide today hold approximately 1,730 tonnes of gold. Sentiment toward Gold is now ""excessively negative"" and we see potential for the yellow metal to recover only once higher US interest rates are priced into markets.
 
 The breakout to the downside of the trading range suggests a fresh leg-down in prices is coming, and that this week's low of $1,085 in gold is not likely to hold. The next longer-term downside price target for gold is a major psychological support at $1,000. At domestic front, similar 8-10 per cent downside could be seen and we could see Gold prices bottoming out around Rs 23,000/10 gm in India.

"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/a-25-fall-in-crude-is-like-a-10-billion-stimulus-for-indian-economy-say-experts-top-stock-bets/articleshow/45121185.cms,m.economictimes.com,"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets","NEW DELHI: India imports around 80 per cent of its crude oil needs, and a fall in the prices of the commodity provides the much needed relief for the country's deficits as the same brings down the import bill.

Analysts say that a $25 fall in crude is like a notional $10 billion stimulus for the Indian economy.

""Falling crude oil prices led to the implementation of the alignment of diesel prices to market rates. This enabled the government to ease subsidy burden. The money saved can now be channeled to some efficient economic projects,"" says Soumyadip Raha, Research Executive - Oil & Gas at Microsec Capital Ltd.

""The government is now mulling over the idea of bringing some of the benefits of lower oil prices to the government exchequer by way of hiking duties,"" he adds.

Further, Raha says that falling crude prices result in better realisations for oil & gas firms as it increases the income of the government from taxes.

Brent crude has seen a sharp fall in 2014 so far, down nearly 30 per cent, on the back of strengthening dollar that suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities.

Brent crude has come down sharply to below $81 a barel in a matter of just five months from around $115 recorded in mid-June. This has already reduced the country's import bill significantly.

India's oil import bill for the last financial year stood at $150 billion.

India's net imports of crude amounts to about a billion barrels a year, and with every dollar decrease in oil prices the bill slips by Rs 4,000 crore, as per media reports.

""The fall in prices (of crude oil) will also lead to lowering of inflation and support higher growth. In turn, lower inflation, improvement in fiscal and current account balances will result in higher GDP growth,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.

""Yes, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the economy as it creates three-way effect on the economy. A fall in crude oil prices results in a drop in crude oil import bills, and thus the total current account deficit is reduced. This strengthens the currency also,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that a drop in crude prices will reduce government's subsidy burden as well as prices of petroleum products in the country would be lowered leading to ease in inflation.

Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors, is of the view that we are going to benefit in a big way with the fall in crude. As someone else was suggesting, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the Indian economy, he adds.

Slowing global demand, especially from the European countries and China, is one of the reasons for this massive decline in the prices of crude, say experts.

The slide in oil had a significant impact on inflation as consumer price inflation has cooled off to its lowest level ever, at 6.46 per cent in September. It has even created room for the Reserve Bank to ease interest rates sooner than expected.


	 


""The fall in oil prices has also provided a commendable stability to the rupee despite a rally in dollar index, thus attracting more inflows into the economy. Overall, the outlook for economic growth has improved,"" says Sugandha Sachdeva, AVP & Incharge - Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Securities Ltd.

As per another estimate, Sachdeva is of the view that a $10 decline in brent implies country's annual import bill falls by around $17 billion.

""Prices are expected to find a strong floor around $80 a barrel and may even retreat towards $88. Having said that, any breach of $80 per barrel would accelerate the fall and lead to a drift towards $75,"" she adds.

Top bets in the oil & Gas space:

Vivek Gupta,CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited

Investors should go long in OMCs like BPCL, HPCL, IOC we also seen have seen decent long build up (rise in open interest & rise in stock price) in these stocks. Our Top Pick is IOC, which is forming a good consolidation on weekly chart; overall trend of stock is up, investors can further enter long around 380 for the target of 440 & 460 in near term.

Nandan Chakraborty, MD-Institutional Equity Research, Axis Capital

The first thing to do when oil prices dip is to buy interest rate sensitives, and not the ones which depend on oil. It is pretty straightforward because if you look at oil marketing companies, as long as LPG and kerosene remain subsidized, they would not have too much of a slack in terms of increase in their profits.

Krishna Kumar Karwa, MD & CFO, Emkay Global Financial Services

As far as the oil marketing and refining companies are concerned, they are the prime beneficiaries of the diesel deregulation. So, we continue to be bullish on HPCL and BPCL.

From a longer-term perspective, I believe that the government is very clear about its policies as far as oil exploration is concerned. These companies should be a key beneficiary of that. They should also benefit from an increase in gas prices. So all in all, I think that these companies should give you very good returns in times to come.

Rahul Singh, Head of Research, Standard Chartered Securities

In the PSU & oil marketing companies, we are positive on Coal India as well and somewhere down the line even ONGC should benefit from lowering of subsidies may be in FY16, although clarity on that is still to emerge. So while PSUs as an asset class have run up and some of them have doubled-tripled, there is still some juice left in some of these companies. But you cannot just generalize.

Bottom-up stock-picking will become more and more important even within the PSUs. So you will have to differentiate much more between the oil marketing companies versus upstream versus GAIL and so on.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: What is your current market view?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Markets will remain range bound in the short-term. They are waiting for an earnings trigger because we saw a significant downgrade in the last quarter. As we get into this first quarter, the trend does not seem to change because the exit rate in the last quarter was very weak, especially on the top line growth but we are pretty confident that you should see a recovery in growth in the second half.
 
 We have seen some early signs of government spending picking up in the first month of this fiscal year. That is going to be the key driver. Government spending this year is going to be key in terms of kick starting demand and we see an impact of that probably in the second half coming through. After the correction, we have seen valuations turning out to be reasonable and any further correction because of global developments could be a good time to increase and add investments into equities.
 
 
ET Now: Yesterday, we saw Tech Mahindra come out and say that the next quarter is not going to be as great. Now, this is something that we have seen played out even in the last quarter when it was almost a blanket profit warning signal from most IT majors. This time too do you sense that this could be more of a sectoral trend rather than just a company specific one? Would the IT sector better avoided for now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: There were cross currency movements in the last quarter, which impacted the dollar growth for most companies. That impact will not be so severe in this quarter because we see some mean reversion over there but in case of the specific company, which you mentioned, I do not think it is an issue across the sector. It is probably the telecom space, where it has a larger footprint, which will result in some slowdown. However, on a broader scale, things are not that bad. In terms of guidance, Cognizant has shown an improvement.
 
 
ET Now: So stick to large cap IT because Infosys, TCS, are sounding reasonably confident for FY16, but what about smaller companies such as KPIT or MindTree?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The IT industry is going through a transition phase where compared to earlier times and material contracts, they are getting more into digitalisation and companies able to do that transition into the digital world are the companies, which will be able to get such an increment because that is where this trend is headed and that is where the incremental orders are.
 
 
ET Now: If indeed the government is going to spend in the first two quarters of the current half of the current fiscal, would the markets start discounting?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The government spending essentially would be in areas like infrastructure which will be in say roads, railways and agriculture etc. These are the areas where you will see not only the central government but the state government because there is a lot of allocation to the state governments this year in the budget and how the state spend also would be important.
 
 So, as we see order flows coming in especially in the road sector, that would lead to some indication. At least it might not reflect into traction down the line because this month is a monsoon month. Activities levels will be a bit low but slowly that money would start to trickle down, get in the hands of various people, consumers. Urban consumption Will start to pick up slowly.
 
 
ET Now: So when you say consumption, considering it is such a large umbrella, what are people going to consume more? More pizzas? Are they going to buy more shoes, more branded clothes or is it going to be cars and other such things?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Currently, what we are seeing is a transition. That is why overall growth is not looking that great. As that inflexion point happens and we are seeing some early signs of that, obviously the demand would be more on the discretionary side. Consumer staples is where the growth is still going to be bit sedate but as your job creation happens, as disposable income increases, as interest rates go down a bit, we do not expect much but at least another 50 bps. We should see demand for all these consumer discretionary products to pick up.
 
 
ET Now: Why do you think demand will pick up, why are you bullish on urban consumption?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: It is not just interest rates which are going to make a big difference. Obviously, interest rates coming down will mean that your EMIs on mortgages will come down. That will mean some amount of savings, which you can spend but more importantly it is going to be demand in terms of job creation. Secondly, because of lower inflation, your real wages are much stronger than what it was earlier so that will slowly lead to pick-up in consumption. We are not expecting any big pick-up but at the margin these are the trends, which we are observing.
 
 
ET Now: Do you sense a renewed vigour in Indian pharma, which is largely exposed to the United States? I am looking at your holding and you do not have too many pharma names. Have I got the holdings right or you genuinely do not have pharma name?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: No, we are neutral on pharma. We have got some of the leading top large cap pharma companies in this portfolio. The pharma companies have had a very good run. Lately, we have seen some kind of product approval delays in a few companies and some correction. The valuations of Indian pharma story continues to look great. They appear good from medium to long term perspective.
 
 The valuations in some of the companies had really gone up very high and there were some near term concerns in a few names. However, the broader long term trajectory in terms of growth in the Indian companies in the US generic space and lot of the companies are also now clearly getting into complex generics, which is slightly higher. So, we think that the growth in this sector should be around 15 per cent to 20 per cent, which is pretty good so we are not negative, we are neutral on that sector.
 
 
ET Now: So you expect the market to be range bound for the next few odd months, what could snap out of this range and what is the biggest risk for India right now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Clearly, monsoon was something, which we were looking at. It has come in pretty good at least for the month of June. One has to see how the onset is in the next few months or so. On the reform side, we have the next monsoon session beginning and expect some development regarding GST. We do not expect much to happen on the Land Acquisition Bill but GST is something, which we would like to get implemented in the next fiscal year because you require these kind of triggers for the market especially at this point in time when growth is still illusive. So these are some of the factors, which one would look at.

ET Now: Our most awaited reform which could have an impact on Indian economy is GST. Assuming that GST would be in place in next 12-15 months, markets would start buying into those sectors well ahead of time. With this assumption, which are the stocks one should buy?
 
 
Deven Choksey: In general, we believe that the GST roadmap will be spelled out in this particular budget. Whether it would get across the board implemented in all the states at one go remains to be seen. However, even if it is getting implemented, it is a process that wille take about one and a half to two years to fully materialise as far as the books of the companies are concerned from the point of view of bringing down the cost structure. The tax structure which will come down because of the rationalisation through GST should benefit most of the consumption oriented businesses before anybody else. Hence, to a greater extent, the focus should remain under the consumption space. Given the kind of possibility in the economy of growth coming back above 6 per cent in the next 12 to 15 months, we believe that automobile sector would probably lead the show at this point of time. Also, automobile sector could possibly have major benefits because of a likely possibility of the bank rate coming down and if interest rates starts coming down, then it would be a double benefit to many of the auto companies. Typically the commercial vehicle segment which have still not moved up as much as the other vehicles or passenger vehicles like Maruti and other companies, I would think that Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland kind of companies within the auto space should remain in the favourable list given this possibility along with the likes of Bajaj Auto which would also remain quite comfortably placed as far as the growth is concerned. This is also due to the export oriented perspective they have. Hence, within the auto space, we like these three. We believe that the consumption space would largely get favoured with the roll out of GST going forward.

Harsh Mariwala in no hurry to pass on the baton of Marico to his children Rishabh & Rajvi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/harsh-mariwala-in-no-hurry-to-pass-on-the-baton-of-marico-to-his-children-rishabh-rajvi/articleshow/32684847.cms,m.economictimes.com,Harsh Mariwala in no hurry to pass on the baton of Marico to his children Rishabh & Rajvi,"MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: Harsh Mariwala isn’t ready to pass on the baton of Marico, a Rs13,500-crore (market cap) consumer goods firm, to the next generation. Not that he isn’t keen, but he would rather wait for a few more years.
 
 Mariwala, who stepped down as Marico managing director on Tuesday, said it’s too early to say if his children Rishabh and Rajvi will eventually be at the helm of the company that he started some 40 years ago. “It’s still too early to come to any conclusion and we will wait and watch as to what pans out. You cannot predict everything in life,” he told ET.
 
 As ET reported in its Tuesday edition, Mariwala passed on the day-to-day operations of the company to CEO Saugata Gupta who has been elevated as MD. His son Rishabh, 33, had spent three years developing business at Marico’s beauty salon services arm Kaya Skin Clinic before starting a premium handmade soaps company in 2009. Almost around the same time, Mariwala’s daughter Rajvi, 34, too opted out of Marico — she was a part of its brand-building team — to focus on sociological research.
 
 
 
  Mariwala, 63, said the firm does not intend to deviate from its strategy of a having a professional management to run its operations and expand the breadth of its products and services. He said the move to promote Gupta was a natural process and not a sudden decision. “Saugata will be in complete control, in charge of managing the overall business,” Mariwala said, adding that all key division heads will now report to Gupta.
 
 Over 43 years ago, Mariwala quit the crowded traders lane on Masjid Bunder in Mumbai with an ambition to make his two highly commoditised products — edible and coconut oil — national brands. Today, Parachute and Saffola are among the biggest oil brands in India, and Marico has about 20 brands across 25 markets. That is what Gupta, 45, has got to manage and grow.
 
 Mariwala’s mandate to Gupta is clear — drive top line growth in existing and new value-added products and capitalise the combined international and domestic business to become far more profitable. But the market environment isn’t very favourable. Copra prices are at all-time high, with 76 per cent increase since last year.
 
 Also, Marico has been underperforming the market by posting less than 5 per cent volume growth for Parachute and single-digit growth for Saffola since the last few quarters. The company admits that short-term pressures will always be there and the key challenge in the long term is to move beyond oil and succeed in value-added portfolio. Gupta said the firm is trying to shift portfolios in favour of new categories such as oats, personal care and hair colour that contribute 20 per cent of its total sales.
 
 At the same time, there will be crosspollination between its international and domestic brands that will perhaps help the firm enter adjacent categories. According to analysts, while Marico maintains its market shares, sharp price increases in hair oils could keep volume growth under pressure in the future. “The company seems cognizant of poor returns in its past acquisitions and sub optimal return ratios and is looking at sustaining 30 per cent plus dividend payout,” Amnish Aggarwal, analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, wrote in an investor note.

"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shreejit-mishra-two-others-quit-hul-stock-up/articleshow/8659741.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL; stock up","
  MUMBAI: Four senior-level executives at Hindustan Unilever have quit over the past few months after spending almost two decades with the country's largest consumer goods company. Among those who have put in their papers are Shreejit Mishra, executive director (Foods), N Rajaram, VP (Haircare & Lakme), Srikanth Srinivasamadhavan, general manager (Media Services) for South Asia, and Jayakumar Krishnaswamy, general manager for Supply Chain Excellence. Mishra was not available for comment, while Srinivasamadhavan declined to speak to ET. HUL neither denied nor confirmed the senior-level departures. 
  
  At 9:55 am, shares of Hindustan Unilever were trading 0.40 per cent up at Rs 304 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  Rajaram joined Bharti Airtel in March as its chief marketing officer, while Krishnaswamy joined Akzo Nobel as Director SCM, late last year after spending over 15 years at HUL in two separate stints.Replying to a detailed questionnaire sent by ET, an HUL spokesperson said, ""The attrition rate in HUL is significantly below industry level, at 5% per annum for the last four years. What we have is natural attrition, which is essential and healthy for all organisations in terms of both talent management and development."" Top officials in the know about these developments said a changing work culture at HUL and increasing job opportunities for HUL managers outside have triggered the exits. 
  
  ""Many of these managers have been in the same role and designation for over three years now. HUL is on top of Polman's list, and his directive that managers will have to spend longer tenures in their existing roles to ensure consistent business strategy, may have also triggered the move. The internal target of around 20% sales growth every quarter is adding to the pressure on HUL managers,"" said another senior HUL official. When Paul Polman took over as Unilever CEO in January 2009, the company was under pressure as customer spend on branded products had slowed down. Polman, the first outsider to head Unilever, injected some aggression into the group - including at its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever - and put in place a performance culture across companies globally, linking rewards to results. 
  
  Brand managers were also asked to report on 30-day schedules, adding to the pressure to perform consistently every quarter. 
  
  The results are now visible at HUL, which has been witnessing 13% volume growth for the fiscal ending March - the highest in over a decade, despite a large base of nearly Rs20,000 crore in sales 
  
  Mishra, who is HUL CEO Nitin Paranjpe's batchmate, is the most high-profile exit. He joined HUL in 1987 as a management trainee and moved up the ladder to become a member of the core management committee. Four years ago Mishra, then VP Activation-Asia AMET, Unilever and based in Singapore, was made Executive Director (Foods). During his tenure, the processed foods division has grown 67%, from Rs 538 crore in 2007 to Rs 900 crore today. 
  
  Watchers say HUL's managers are much sought after in the corporate world. ""It's good to see HUL managers becoming ambitious. The company has always been a good training ground for managers to perform well in other companies across sectors,"" said Kannan Sitaram, operating partner at India Equity Partners, who spent over two decades with Unilever. ""In the last few years, HUL's pyramid was getting narrower at the top, influencing some managers to take up top jobs at other companies"".

Emcure Pharmaceuticals withdraws proposed IPO,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/emcure-pharmaceuticals-withdraws-proposed-ipo/articleshow/36353156.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Emcure Pharmaceuticals withdraws proposed IPO,"NEW DELHI: Emcure Pharmaceuticals has withdrawn its proposed initial public offer, which was looking to raise up to Rs 500 crore, making it fourth withdrawal this year. 

 The Pune-based pharma company had filed draft offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the proposed IPO in June last year. 

 The proposed issue comprised of fresh issue of up to Rs 300 crore and an offer for sale of up to 25,13,057 equity share. 

 However, the company through its lead merchant banker IDFC Capital withdrew its offer documents on June 6 this year, as per the latest update available with Sebi. 

 The pharma company intends to utilise the net proceeds for setting up of new manufacturing facilities and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, research and development and general corporate purposes. 

 The company is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a broad range of pharmaceutical products globally. 

 Emcure Pharmaceuticals operates nine manufacturing facilities, eight of which are located in India and one in the US. 

 Prior to Emcure Pharmaceuticals, three firms --Trimax IT Infrastructure and Services, BSCPL Infrastructure and GMR Energy-- had withdrawn their respective public offer plans this year so far.

Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-it-will-be-a-tough-task-for-vishal-sikka-to-revive-infosys-back-to-its-glory/articleshow/36430060.cms,m.economictimes.com,Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,"The mood on bourses appears to be not so encouraging after the announcement of Infosys to appoint Vishal Sikka as CEO and MD. After a firm opening on Thursday, the stock came under selling pressure. It had lost 2% on NSE by 11am. The big worry for investors is whether it’s too late for Sikka to be at the helm and whether the current issues facing the erstwhile industry bellwether can be surmountable.
 
 Sikka has to wade through following major challenges and that would be easier said than done:
 
 1. 
The growth conundrum- Infosys has added a significant number of new clients, 238 to be precise at the gross level, in the four quarters to March 2014. This is higher compared to its peers. However, this did not culminate into higher revenue growth. Infy’s sequential revenue growth lagged that of its close peers including TCS and Cognizant and a smaller peer, HCL Technologies.
 
 2. 
The changing nature of deliverables- The global IT outsourcing industry has shifted from traditional wage arbitrage to multi-year, deals that are capable of transforming the business. This includes remote infrastructure management (RIM) services. At present, Infosys derives over 7% revenue from RIM compared with peers who earn 12-34% revenue from this segment. RIM has shown a higher growth over the past few years compared with the traditional services. This makes it necessary for Sikka to focus on improving Infy’s exposure to this segment.
 
 3. 
Higher employee attrition rate- Infosys has not been able to tame the rate of attrition in the past few quarters. Attrition was 18.7% during the March 2014 quarter compared with 16.3% a year ago. This is also higher than 11.3% for TCS and 16.9% for HCL Tech. Talent management and retention will be a tough task for Sikka.
 
 4. 
Sliding profitability- Infosys has long been following what it coined as quality growth in the form of industry-best margin profile. But this has changed over the past few quarters as the company reported a sharp fall in operating margin. In the March’14 quarter, it reported operating margin was 25.5% compared with over 30% in the March’10 quarter. During the said period, both TCS and HCL Tech improved their profitability. Sikka will have to strike a fine balance between growth and profitability as he scouts to bring the company back to its glory days.

Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/association-of-mutual-funds-in-india-warns-members-to-stay-away-from-suspicious-ready-forward-certificate-of-deposits/articleshow/32817251.cms,m.economictimes.com,Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,"The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has asked its members to desist from suspicious ready forward deals in certificate of deposits (CDs). In an e-mail to fund houses a few days ago, AMFI chief executive HN Sinor also warned that the market regulator wants to end this practice as it leads to asset management companies risking investor money. 

 “Also, desist from entering into undesirable trades/transactions, which are not in conformity with regulation,” Sinor said in the e-mail, reviewed by ET. Sinor asked the fund houses to furnish daily transaction date to CRISIL/ICRA, the rating companies that provide daily CD quotes. ET had on March 12 reported that some asset management companies were doing CD trades at a pre-fixed rate, which were perceived to be violating norms while increasing the risk for investors. The financial mechanism, known as “parking” or “river crossing” or “holding period return”, is generally seen towards the end of a financial year and involves four parties — the issuer of CDs, the ultimate subscribers, cashrich entities such as banks and companies that provide parking space, and the intermediaries. 

 The latest AMFI communiqué came after the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) sought clarification on such practices in an e-mail dated March 21. “Some fund houses complained to Sebi to stop recurrence of this unhealthy practice. The regulator spoke to AMFI on this and later, official e-mails were exchanged,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. 

 In its reply to Sebi, AMFI assured of maintaining “best practices” among fund houses. It wrote, “The parking phenomenon……. leads to funds buying assets at yields higher than the then prevailing yields in April.” 

 Mutual funds, the biggest buyers of CDs, face redemption pressure in their liquid funds from lenders that need money to expand credit. At this point, some intermediaries or brokers connect some cash-rich entities, be it banks or corporates, which extend funding support to MFs by temporarily buying the three-month CDs at typically 9.60% to 9.90% range at the fag end of March quarter from issuers.

 Infibeam, which owns and operates e-commerce venture Infibeam.com and B2B e-commerce platform BuildABazaar, is looking to raise about Rs 500 crore -Rs 1,000 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), while targeting a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore-Rs 4,000 crore.
 
 “Investor interest continues to peak when it comes to strong internet businesses in India that have shown consistent growth, and I think we are well poised to capture that,“ said Vishal Mehta, founder and chief executive of Infibeam.
 
 Infibeam, which sees about 80,000 transactions across its platforms, has targeted a revenue of Rs 500 crore and gross merchandise sales of about Rs 2,000 crore for the current fiscal.
 
 The IPO, expected in 2015, will make Infibeam the first Indian e-commerce company to go public in the country. HomeShop18, which has al so announced plans to go public, has filed documents to list on the US exchanges.
 
 Infibeam, which has appointed Axis Bank to be the lead book runner for the IPO, is looking to list on both the National Stock exchange and the BSE.
 
 The developments come at a time when consumer internet companies, while receiving increasing funding from private equity and strategic investors, have also begun to receive significant attention from the country's retail investors.
 
 “There will be an appetite and there is no reason why we won't see the same trends as in the US or China,“ said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital, a leading investment bank.
 
 Local business listings website JustDial's public market flotation in May last year saw a strong response from investors, with the company raising about Rs 950 crore in the process. The company's market capitalisation on Monday stood at Rs 10,200 crore.
 
 Matrimonial venture BharatMatrimony.com has also signalled its intention of going public by the next financial year, which could see other consumer internet companies follow suit.
 
 Infibeam, which is yet to raise any foreign institutional capital, may also look to sell a portion of its equity through private placements ahead of its planned IPO. Mehta, however, did not disclose details, stating that the company was still in discussions.
 
 Foreign investors have purchased a net $34.99 billion of stocks and debt until October 21 this year. In 2013, India's stock market received a net foreign fund inflow of $20.10 billion while the debt market saw an outflow of $7.97 billion, stock exchange data showed.
 
 “The Indian market is looking at the consumer internet space, but while it may accept the business model, it may not accept companies that continue to make losses. That is the gap which has to be addressed,“ said Garg.

  The Nifty started the earlier week on a bearish note, as fair amount of liquidity was pulled out of the system for the Coal India IPO. The Nifty ended the week at 6066; almost flat compared to the previous week’s close. 
  
  FIIs bought Rs 1,893 crore worth of shares in cash while local institutions sold worth Rs 1,388 crore India VIX, which measures the immediate expected volatility, and saw a weekly high of 23.9 and closed at 21.61. 
  
  We saw highest build-up of Calls at 6200 followed by 6300 (for the October and November series). We expect this activity to continue as the market gathers a bullish undertone. Highest Put build-up was seen at 6000 strike. PCR-OI for the October expiry is at 1.18, while that for the November expiry stood at 1.24. Higher PCR for November is purely a function of hedging activity; with majority of Put build-up seen at strikes below 5900. It should not be construed as a bearish signal.
  
  Overseas growth data to be watched for will be US home sales, employment data and advance estimates for US 3Q-GDP. Back home, we will have WPI data being reported on the expiry day. Technically, the Nifty has not given any signs of topping out and is still holding the momentum. Fresh round of selling could be seen only if the Nifty hits a new bottom of 5930 and trades below this level. 
  
  Till then, we continue to maintain ‘buy’ on every decline. Fresh round of buying could be seen, if the Nifty holds above 6115, then the next target could be 6220-6330. The market will continue to consolidate in the range of (5900-6200) with extreme volatility on the cards, as metal majors JSPL, Sterlite and SAIL report 
  earning this week. 
  
  Strong support is seen at 6010 levels. We observed very high Call IVs at ATM strikes for Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Hindalco and ICICI Bank hinting these scrips may see a run-up from their current levels.

Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/euro/usd-looking-at-support-between-1-3815-30/articleshow/34377220.cms,m.economictimes.com,Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30," 	Euro Summary  	Euro-dollar closed in NY Monday at $1.3853 after rate had corrected away from highs of $1.3879 to $1.3840 into the European close before it drifted higher through the US afternoon. Rate touched an early low of $1.3849 in Asia before picking up fresh demand that lifted it to $1.3865 ahead of the European open. This recovery/buoyant tone continued into Europe as rate pushed on to $1.3872, holding back at $1.3865 into the release of Saxony CPI data. The m/m release showing a fall of 0.1% prompted sales to $1.3860 but with the y/y coming in at 1.3% (up from previous 0.9%) saw buyers quickly emerge into the dip to take it up to retest Monday's high at $1.3879. Rate eased away from this level, with the correction given an added shove from release of soft Italian retail sales, ECB M3 data and soft German states' CPI. Rate found support at $1.3855 (61.8% $1.3840-79) before bouncing back to $1.3870 as Germany NRW CPI came in above expectations. The euro was holding firm in late morning trade, with continued talk of Russian interest to buy euros in dips. Resistance seen at $1.3879/85, ahead of $1.3900. Support $1.3850/40.  	EUR/USD  	Still failing to break significantly through the 76.4% Fibo retracement at $1.3876, maybe been a couple of points higher, at this stage. Now looking to support from between $1.3815-30 to hold this decline, or risk a much deeper fall and the possibilty of a double top around $1.3878. While intact, we can see another attempt higher, $1.3904-$1.3977 the immediate target zone above. Below $1.3815 and the Apr 22 low at $1.3786 becomes key.  	Sterling Summary  	Cable closed in NY Monday at $1.6810 after rate had posted multi year highs at $1.6858 on the back of demand prompted by confirmation from US Pfizer of its interest to buy UK AstraZeneka. However, talk of an Astra price tag rebuttal, along with Pfizer stating that funds for such a takeover are mainly held offshore, weighed back on sterling, which along with release of stronger than forecast US house data pressed cable to session lows of $1.6801. Demand between $1.6805/1.6795 cushioned the move. Early Asian trade was contained within a tight $1.6807/10 range (trade very subdued due to the Tokyo holiday; start of Golden Week) before it lifted to $1.6817, settling between $1.6813/15 into Europe. Reported euro-sterling stops above stg0.8250 targeted in opening Europe trade, the rate pushing to stg0.8252 before reversing to stg0.82255 as sterling picked up decent demand on positioning ahead of UK GDP release. Positive press comments by BOE Carney provided an added boost as cable traded to $1.6846. However, data came in just under forecast and sterling was sold to $1.6792/stg0.8259 but buyers quickly emerged to take cable back to $1.6820, the cross to stg0.8245.  	GBP/USD  	Rally through $1.6841 has been curtailed by the swing target at $1.6857 so far. Subsequent decline has to hold above $1.6790-95 support, in order to retain current upside momentum. Loss would put recent $1.6779-$1.6765 lows under pressure, beneath which $1.6713-$1.6662 come back into the picture. While near term supports hold, then we can challenge $1.6857 again, with $1.6881-$1.6918 still the target zone above.  	Yen Summary  	Dollar-yen witnessed a very subdued Asian session with trade tied to a narrow Y102.47-54 range. The cross opening around Y141.97 made a show through Y142.00 on the back of triggered stops in euro-aussie, before stalling ahead of tech resistance at Y142.16 (61.8% of Y143.45-140.08). Traders await the BOJ policy meeting and press conference tomorrow for further market direction. Demand via the crosses improved appetite in early Europe, lifting the pairs to Y102.55/Y142.25 and a break of tight overnight ranges. Euro-yen triggered stops on the move before momentum stalled and drifted lower. Release of German Saxony CPI which came in lower at -0.1% m/m initially slipped to Y142.12, before a stronger y/y reading countered the move, spiking to Y142.27. Second wave demand with added support from a strong sterling-yen move took the cross on to extended highs of Y142.45. Mixed CPI readings from Brandenburg, Hesse and Bavaria followed and with added weight from soft eurozone M3 data, pared light gains. A stronger North Rhine CPI looked to re-test intraday highs, however the move lacked conviction to settle in narrow range trade. Dollar-yen tracked early moves and spiked to Y102.67, the rate holds firm with offers seen into Y102.70.  	USD/YEN  	The move through Y102.40 on Monday should now give us another look at Y102.72. Above and we head for Y103.15-Y103.45, an area which includes two projected targets, as well as Fibo retracements. May well be tough to break above here at this stage. Support in the meantime has moved up to Y102.20-30 and a loss here on the day would be a disappointment and suggest the recovery was struggling again.

 With this, as many as 104 companies have been listed on BSE SME since the launch of the platform in March 12, 2012. Of these, six companies have migrated to the exchange's main board. 

 As on date, BSE SME platform has helped the listed SMEs raise nearly Rs 756 crore from the capital markets. 

 The BSE SME platform helps SMEs raise funds to meet their business needs. 

 Of the five companies -- Gala Print City, M D Inducto Cast, Loyal Equipments and Jiya Eco Products -- are based in Gujarat, while Majestic Research Services & Solutions is located in Karnataka. 

 Noting that there were thousands of potentially good SMEs that should list on capital markets, BSE Managing Director and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan told reporters that 20-25 companies are expected to list on SME platform in the next 2-3 months. 

 ""In this fiscal, 100 more SMEs are expected to hit the markets,"" he added.

S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sp-upgrade-may-drive-fii-debt-flow/articleshow/43764215.cms,m.economictimes.com,S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,"MUMBAI: The foreign fund flows into Indian debt instruments may turn into a tide with investors gaining confidence after Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook for India to stable from negative in line with other international rating companies Moody’s and Fitch. 

 Standard & Poor’s move last week, owing to the new stable government at the Centre that the company will prove conducive to reforms, came at a time when foreign holding limits in government bonds are nearly exhausted and overseas investors are turning to corporate debt, bringing borrowing costs of companies lower even as the Reserve Bank of India wants to keep rates high. 

 “The change in S&P’s outlook will only strengthen global investors’ favourable long-term outlook towards India,” said Neville Fernandes, head of debt capital markets at Citi India. “The confluence of low interest rates, tight credit spreads, abundant liquidity and favourable investor outlook for India presents a very attractive financing opportunity for Indian corporates.” 

 India’s rating of BBB-minus is the lowest in investment grade, below which is the ‘junk’ category where investors are normally wary of investing. 

 Till August this year, foreign institutional investors or FIIs have net invested Rs 1,02,473 crore in Indian debt securities compared with net sales of Rs 50,848 crore in 2013. 

 FIIs are fast exhausting their limits or caps set for investing in Indian debt securities. They have already utilised nearly 97% of the $25 billion earmarked for government securities while they have exhausted 66.50% of the limit for long-term investments in government bonds for more than five years. 

 Overseas investors have of late turned to corporate debt segment capped at $51 billion. So far, they have exhausted about 46% compared with 35% on June 2. 

 Since government limits for regular FIIs and foreign portfolio investors or FPIs are practically filled, enquiries are increasingly coming in for corporate debt investments, said Ananth Narayan, regional head of financial markets at South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. 

 According to dealers, some of the actively traded corporate securities include top-rated Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, Food Corporation of India, HDFC Ltd, L&T and UltraTech. 

 The yield spread between government and corporate bonds has contracted 15-20 basis points in the past few months, suggesting fall in corporate bond yields. Yield and prices move in opposite direction. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. 

 “In September alone, so far we have seen high inflows of about $1.5 billion, which could be a record high. In terms of pricing, corporate issuers would be benefited due to higher demand,” said Lakshmi Iyer, senior vice president and head of fixed income and products at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management. 

 Acting as custodians, two multinational banks have in the past few weeks added 15-20 institutional clients each from Europe for investing in India. Large institutional investors like Pimpco, BlackRock, Warburg Pincus, Fidelity and Fairfax are expected to step up their bets in Indian debt securities, dealers said. Last month, foreign fund Franklin Templeton had bought bonds worth about Rs 16,000 crore in the largest single-day purchase of Indian government securities. 

 “The ratings revision encapsulates the positive sentiment on India, but more importantly takes us a step closer to a game-changing rating upgrade for India. We believe large institutional investors will continue to invest,” said Amit Bordia, head of corporate Finance at Deutsche Bank India. 

 Some foreign central banks and long-term pension and insurance funds from Southeast Asian and European countries are also expected to ramp up their investments with lot sizes of Rs 200-500 crore each.

Broadly, DLF is in a range of about 210 to about 235-240 but pop means nothing. Unless DLF really gets past significant levels something like 250 on the upside, no significant rally is going to start.

Deven Choksey: Yes, at times, it would surprise us for sure. Not every company would probably fit into the M&A kind of a story that we are talking about. Even I am sure that Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy probably must have done a good amount of due diligence before buying into the Ranbaxy. So to a greater extent, applying the same yardstick to every company would be wrong but yes, the market has a mind of its own. Probably they have some different way of looking at Wockhardt. I am not totally sure as to what are the kind of stories that they are playing around with. But yes, where exactly the growth comes from in this company is an intriguing question.
 
 So we would not get into this particular company. We would rather stay with the likes of Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy, the likes of Cipla, the likes of Glenmark, or Lupin in the pharma space.

 The three main indexes are set for sharp monthly declines, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 4% after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's blunt and hawkish remarks on Friday about keeping monetary policy tight ""for some time"" quashed hopes of more modest rate hikes.

 Meanwhile, mixed economic data signaling easing price pressures and strong labor market has weighed on investors' mind heading into September, which is a typically a weak month for stock market returns.

 The benchmark S&P 500 is up 9.6% from its mid-June lows but remains in bear market after plummeting earlier this year.

 ADP National Employment report, due at 08:15 am ET, is expected to show private payrolls likely increased by 288,000 in August. It will be followed by a reading on Chicago PMI for August after market open.

 On Tuesday, data showed U.S. job openings rose to 11.239 million in July, pushing stocks to close lower for a third straight session.

 It also comes ahead of the more comprehensive and closely watched jobs data for August on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 300,000 jobs last month after rising by 528,000 in July.

 Any signs of a cooling job market would be welcomed by markets as that could ease the pressure on the Fed to stick to outsized rate hikes.

 Heavyweight technology and growth stocks such as Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc and Nvidia Corp, which took a beating in last few days due to a surge in Treasury yields on rate hike prospects, rose between 0.6% and 0.8% in premarket trading.

 At 07:07 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 25 points, or 0.08%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.26%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 83.75 points, or 0.68%.

Investors should consider accumulating the stock at the current level, given some of the triggers for the company, going ahead.
 
 The positives that could play out in the next few quarters include cash from Whyte and Mackay sale, new CEO and the premium story. USL could have the best risk-reward ratio for the next few months. The upside can be significant, and the downside limited, irrespective of the election outcome (due to the open offer which will begin in June), analysts say. “Diageo is our top pick due to several catalysts in the stock,” said Manoj Menon, consumer analyst, Deustche Equities.
 
 
  
Whyte & Mackay Impact 
 
 The company is expected to complete the W&M asset sale in the next few months after concerns on competition raised by the UK Office of Fair Trade. The company has hired Standard Chartered, Rothschild and Rabo Bank as advisors and it’s understood that the bids have already come in. Although the bid prices are not known, analysts value W&M at £350-700 million (Rs3,500-7,000 crore).
 
 “If the value realised for W&M is around £700 million, this will unlock value for United Spirits, wipe out its entire debt and increase its long-term return ratio profile,” said Arnab Mitra of Credit Suisse in a recent report. He added that W&M value unlocking could be a major trigger for the USL stock and at a valuation of £650 million, the EPS upside could be almost 45.2 per cent for FY15. At the end of September 2013, its net debt stood at Rs7,100 crore with over two-thirds of the company’s operating profit going towards debt servicing.
 
 
Lowest Open Offer Premium
 
 The offer is about 18.5 per cent higher than the floor price (26-week average price) of USL, one of the lowest among open offers in two years. This is despite Diageo seeking control of United Spirits. Last year, HUL had launched open offer at 23 per cent premium and GSK Consumer Healthcare at 37.2 per cent to the floor price. Both the stocks are now trading above their offer prices.
 
 “We are advising clients to buy the stock as, among large-caps, it has the best risk-reward ratio,” said a sales official of a leading multinational brokerage on condition of anonymity. “There is a possibility that Diageo has kept a buffer and may increase the open offer price after talking to institutional investors, who may not tender at such a low premium.”
 
 
Diageo on USL
 
 In November 2012, when Diageo acquired USL at Rs1,440, the investment was expected to be economic profit positive in six years. Despite more than doubling the price (Rs3,030 now), Diageo claims the investment would be economic profit positive in seven years. “There has been a significant rerating of the Indian consumer goods story, given the promise of renewed economic buoyancy and other macro positives,” said Deirdre Mahlan, CFO, Diageo, in a recent interview.
 
 This reflects an upward revision in earnings estimates by Diageo for USL. “We do not expect a full acceptance for the offer and believe longer term investors will wait for the premiumisation theme to play out in USL,” said Harit Kapoor of IDFC.

They will be listed in the Singapore Exchange. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 

 These bonds of five-and-a-half year maturities come with a coupon rate of about 4.50%. The bank has arrived at such pricing after adding a 280-basis point spread over and above the 5-year US Treasury, which is currently trading in the range of 1.70-1.74%. The effective yield has come around 4.54%. ""The entire fund will be used for offshore operations,"" a senior bank official told ET, adding that rates offered were a win-win for both the investors and the bank. Institutional investors across Asia, Europe and the Middle-East have subscribed to the issuance. 

 UBI has sold bonds through their Hong Kong branch. These offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase were the investment bankers for the issue building. The securities are rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors while S&P, another global rating company, has assigned a BBB- to the issuance. 

 Almost two weeks ago, the State Bank of India (SBI) had raised a total of $1.25 billion by selling bonds in two maturities: five and ten years. The five-year bond was priced at a spread or gap of 205 bps over the 5-year US treasury, which would be equivalent to a yield of 3.62%. This is significantly below than the Union Bank of India's spread at 280 bps. ""Being the largest Indian lender SBI commands premium among investors, who always consider the bank as quasi-government bond. The rest state-owned banks do not enjoy the same,"" said an investment banker.

 In the entire tyre pack, people have not looked at Balkrishna Industries in a very serious manner. This is one counter in the tyre space which one needs to look at current levels, it is an excellent company exporting to 120 countries.

The company’s key inputs include steel and allied products, and according to various estimates, domestic steel prices are higher by nearly 11% YoY in the third quarter, as domestic steel prices are quoting at a premium of 8-10% compared with the landed cost of imported steel. The company’s net profit was Rs 22.2 crore for the third quarter, a rise of 44.2% YoY, helped by lower interest costs and higher turnover. The quarterly results of Texmaco were declared after the close of trading on Wednesday, but the stock had declined 0.9% to Rs 162.5. However, over the past six months, the Street has been optimistic on the growth prospects of the company, and this stock has surged 94% compared with a 30.7 % rise in the Sensex during this period. In the case of Titagarh Wagons, its stock price had also risen 40.8% over the past six months. Texmaco had recently raised nearly Rs 170 crore through a QIP and it plans to use the funds raised for modernisation of its manufacturing units. It also plans to use a part of the proceeds to fund a joint venture with Australia-based United group for manufacture of metro coaches.The company also plans to diversify into other related business segments such as heavy castings and forgings and metal fabrication. Texmaco, trades at nearly 22.8 times on a trailing four-quarter basis. Rival, Titagarh Wagons trades at 16.8 times on a trailing basis and looks cheaper."

We are currently going through a phase of long term unusually low volatility. So this is a bull market but the moves are small. So we have been creeping up for quite a while and at the moment it looks that is exactly what we are going to continue doing for a while. Sure, in that light where do you think leadership will come from for the markets? Which are the stocks within the index which are looking the strongest on the charts right now for you? Well, this particular rally has once again got the same leaders that the past rallies have got, that is auto leading particularly Tata Motors and Mahindra not doing badly either this time and metal stocks have also once again picked up that momentum. The new sector which has not always been there in rallies but looks promising right now is cement, that sector is also doing quite well. Coming on some of these metal stocks that you feel attractive at this point in time from the metals pack. There is a good move happening as we speak in Sesa Goa. It is towards the high of the day. This little dip in the market has not affected it. So that looks quite a strong stock but even the Tata Steels are not very far behind. There is a good amount of momentum there. Hindalco has also made a good move. So it is across different metals as such. Sterlite has also been quite strong. So it is an overall wide base metal rally and as has often happened when the market is an intermediate uptrend, the metals go up. The only thing to look out for in metals is once there is an intermediate downtrend, they do tend to correct quite heavily as well. Stock specific to you, JP Associates, just announcing those cement despatch numbers up 60%, stock is showing some up move today as well. Yes, the stock has been a little quiet before today in the last two three weeks since this rally started gaining force but it is doing a bit of a catch up now and it is also at the high of the day. So this is reasonably promising but it is not at its bull market high. So the longer term trend in this stock is not that well established say auto or some of the other sectors. Question on cement, two specific stocks, UltraTech Cement and Binani Cement, both up close to 6% in today’s trade. Well, to take Binani Cement first, this has crept up really to the, it is the bull market high at about 75. It has come up there once or twice and then reversed. So now what has got to be seen is whether it stabilises above this level. If it does then it is onto a new bull market high which is really an affirmation that it is partaking in the bull market and in a strong uptrend, so that is really what is to be looked for over here. Apollo Hospitals? Apollo Hospitals if you look at the stock, it is for here’s and there’s it has tended to remain in a range. So as far as the long term is concerned of the stock, there is really very little happening here. Short term it makes sporadic moves and today would fall in that category. The very long term range in this stock has been something around 350-700 which it is approaching the top of until there is a breakout because it has not managed to do this since 2003. That is what we got to look for. Wheels India, that is up 20% today, is it looking good for more? This is not really that heavily traded a stock, so when you get a move which after days and months of inactivity takes place, one would not read too much into it but the interest today is definitely there. Today’s volume is perhaps higher than that of the last 8-10 days put together but this would not be the sort of move that I would get interested in this stock because it is a one off situation but somebody holding the stock should certainly hold onto it, it is up at the circuit and it is good payoff if people had been holding onto this stock patiently. From a trading angle, a short term target on MTNL given the momentum? Well, it is only now that there is some interest in this stock. It is first of all in the wrong sector. That sector has been doing very poorly and this stock has been of considerable disinterest to traders, its volumes have dropped but last three or four days, there is some momentum building up. If it is somebody is very speculative about it maybe, take a position, see what happens a day or two ahead but there are better options around. Ideas that you think look interesting, give us at least two of them for tomorrow morning? Well, continuation of the closing today, so Sesa Goa which I just mentioned earlier, that has had a good close and Tata Motors is always a very safe bet in a rally. It tends to be among the leading index stocks, so these two should be able to maintain where they have finished. I would not go with fertiliser yet because they were not doing very much before today. So I would wait for them to correct first and then look at buying them. You would avoid fertilisers, that has been established. You still want to monitor the momentum that we have seen in today’s session but aside of that, the other strong midcap movers whether it was the auto component space, the auto majors, some sporadic moves coming in on BOC India and the likes, what would be your pick, what is one trading position that you would carry forward into tomorrow?The problem at auto ancillaries is that they do not trade very heavily. So if you are looking for stocks which have say a futures contracts or so attached, you do not get too many auto components but if you look at the stocks as such, they have been doing pretty well right from the tyre industry to axels or any other auto components. So the auto sector is obviously giving them a boost, so anybody holding any of these stocks, they have good long term ideas and definitely need to be in there. The other sector not mentioned at all today but as budget approaches and since fertiliser is making the moves could be the rail stocks because already the volumes have picked up in all the Kalindee’s, (15:23) and Texmaco’s, so they could also be once again in the running before the budget."

ET Now: The buying that we have seen in IT and pharma and PSUs today, do you think that can continue into Monday morning? 

 
Ashwani Gujral: I think that can continue even till the 9th or 10th of this month because a lot of the rally that we have seen in cyclicals is kind of a hope-fuelled rally. And while it is nice to be hopeful, you would be much better off trying to enter stocks which have a) corrected and b) will benefit from a stable government. The tech stocks are going to benefit because they turn cyclically. So, a move up is probably round the corner. All the froth has gone, most people have gotten out of their tech stocks so this is a good time cyclically. People will get into the space because if something goes wrong the CNX IT will very quickly get back towards 10,000, and then these stocks will hedge your positions if you are planning to go long into the elections. So that way PSUs will do well. People are continuously building positions in PSUs regardless of the verdict. In any case, they are so dead and beaten up that they can only move higher. So probably the next week could be good for them.

  What is the call on large cap IT stocks?
   
  
  Sudarshan Sukhani: The rally that we saw in large cap IT stocks is probably over which is the reason why I have added TCS to my short selling list after a long time. We are going to see lower levels in all of them. Infosys has already begun its correction, Wipro has done it. 
  
  So the 2 stocks left are TCS and HCL Tech. Both will correct. The chances are that their correction will be relatively shallow but for TCS we can look at 900 to 950 and that would be an attractive level to enter it.

 At the end of today’s trade, the market-capitalisation (m-cap) of TCS soared to Rs 5,09,523.91 crore, the highest for the company since its listing in 2004. Shares of the outsourcing giant ended the day at Rs 2,601.30, up 2.45% on the BSE. In intra-day trade, it rose by 2.9% to Rs 2,612.95. 

 In dollar terms, TCS’ market valuation rose to $84 billion.TCS, the first Indian company to achieve the feat, had earlier crossed Rs 5 lakh crore market-cap in July this year. 

 The IT bellwether is also currently the country’s most valued company in terms of market valuation. TCS is followed by state-run ONGC whose m-cap stood at Rs 3,74,730.47 crore, Reliance Industries (Rs 3,33,400.02 crore), ITC (Rs 2,78,020.71 crore) and Coal India (Rs2,37,495.30 crore).

"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tcs-signals-slowdown-brokerages-remain-unfazed-retain-rating/articleshow/32290558.cms,m.economictimes.com,"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating","NEW DELHI: After Infosys, India’s largest software company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has signalled that the March quarter is typically slower for them than the Dec quarter due to seasonality and fewer days.

Hence, Q4FY14’s QoQ revenue growth could be lower than the October–December quarter (Q3) at 3%, but “this should not be any indication of slowdown in demand,” clarified the management.

The management, however, has reiterated that the FY15 revenue growth would be higher than FY14, led by improvement in discretionary spending in the US and market penetration in Europe.

Key takeaways from TCS analysts meet highlighted the fact that near-term commentary remains soft, but the management retains its positive discretionary spend-led FY15 outlook.

TCS expects Q4 to be softer than Q3 in CC terms, growth to be led by Europe and Latam, and India to decline. But the management is confident of a strong outlook for FY15 over FY14. Margins, however, are likely to drop 40-50bps QoQ due to investments.

However, analysts at top brokerage firms are of the view that revenue growth will be seasonally low in the upcoming quarter, but overall trends look positive and currency will play a small role in Q4. But investors who want to remain invested in the IT space for long term should look at accumulating the stock on dips.

“Margin impact of currency fluctuations and reinvestments would likely be 40-50bps in Q4FY14. We adjust our FY14-15 estimates as per management commentary, but maintain our rating on TCS,” Barclays said in a note.

Barclays has incorporated the management commentary in their forecasts and consequently lowered their FY15-16 EPS estimates by 1.0 per cent. The global investment bank has revised its target price to Rs2,275 and maintains ‘equal-weight’ rating on the stock.

Earlier in the month of March, Bangalore-based Infosys spooked the street after chief executive SD Shibulal told investors the company was expecting to end the current fiscal year only near the lower end of its 11.5-12% guidance.

Reacting to the news, most brokerage firms reduced their respective target prices for Infosys. BofA-ML, Deutsche Bank and Barclays reduced their respective 12-months target prices by Rs 200-300.

But analysts are more confident this time on TCS and see more of a temporary phase for the company as management still remains confident about global operations.

Analysts expect the IT major to outperform industry on revenue growth as management commentary on demand trends for FY2015 continued to be reassuring, led by a favorable demand environment and market share gains.

“We expect TCS to outperform industry on revenue growth due to its superior market reach and excellent execution capabilities. We expect TCS to grow its USD revenues at a CAGR of 16.5% over FY2013-15 and EPS at a CAGR of 25% during this period,” Angel Broking said in a report.

	 
TCS has executed well over the past many quarters and currently trades at 18.5x FY2015E EPS. The Mumbai-based brokerage firm believes that TCS’ premium multiples are well deserved given consistency in performance and leadership in growth/profitability. They maintain their ‘buy’ rating on the stock.

Here are the views of five global brokerages firms on TCS post analysts’ meet:

Barclays:

The global investment bank has incorporated management commentary in their forecasts and consequently revised their FY15-16 EPS estimates downwards by 1.0 per cent. Their numbers imply 4.5% US$ revenue CQGR for FY15E compared to 3.6% witnessed in FY14.

Barclays’ revised the price target is Rs 2,275 (based on 18x weighted average of FY15-16E EPS) and they continue to maintain ‘equal-weight’ (EW) rating as they find valuations fair.

Goldman Sachs:

Goldman Sachs has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2122.55. It says EBIT margins should remain in a stable band, though we may see some impact (40-50 bp) as TCS continues to make investments in the business through penetrating newer geographies, service lines. Hence, it has maintained that margins may stabilize in the 27%-28% band in the long term.

Citigroup:

While Q4 is likely impacted by seasonality, management commentary on demand trends for FY15 continued to be reassuring. Expectations/valuations in TCS are the highest in the sector, and there could be limited upside from these levels. For investors who are looking for some upside in IT sector, Citi prefers Wipro and HCLT among the Tier 1 stocks.

Their target price of Rs 2,350 is based on 20x Mar'15E EPS. Citi estimates TCS' earnings will grow at a 23% CAGR over FY13-16E, and believed the stock should trade closer to the higher end of its historical five-year trading range of 7-24x 12-month forward earnings.

Morgan Stanley:

MS remains overweight on the stock. The global investment bank believes that management commentary about a weaker 4Q will keep expectations low going into the results. Overall, Morgan Stanley believes muted expectations for 4Q are unlikely to lead to any material change in the Street’s FY15 earnings expectations. The stock is trading at a premium to its peers (~19x FY15e and ~16x FY16e EPS), that could be sustained over the coming quarters.

Religare Institutional Research:

TCS valuations, though at a premium to the sector, have moderated to 19x FY15E earnings. Predictable growth and the ability to navigate margins will support TCS’s premium over the sector.

An improvement in demand outlook and continued execution would be the key stock triggers. Religare maintains ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,450.

Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/tax-free-bonds-regain-demand-in-the-secondary-market/articleshow/48059129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,"MUMBAI: Tax-free bonds which have been languishing for more than six months due to lack of investor interest in the secondary market, are in demand again.
 
 High networth individuals and some institutional investors are willing to invest in the instrument via the secondary market as they expect new tax-free series to offer lower rates on the back of expected fall in the benchmark yield and the odds for more rate cuts by the central bank have increased.
 
 “For HNIs wanting larger allocation, secondary tax frees will make sense, if there is some supply,” said Himanshu Bhagat, managing partner at IIFL Wealth. “Here (secondary market), we can then see some limited yield correction.”
 
 During 2013-14, Rs 49,200 crore of tax-free bonds were sold with rates offered in the range of 8.01-8.76% for 10-20 year maturities. Two years earlier, bonds worth Rs 48,000 crore were offered at a wide range of 6.82-8.30%.
 
 A week ago, the government mandated seven top-rated state-run companies to raise Rs 40,000 crore this financial year. Issuers are expected to start bond sales from this month-end in a phased manner. Sizable issues are expected in October-March, the period people plan their tax saving and have funds to invest.
 
 “HNIs and some cash-rich corporates are now keen to take bets on tax-free bonds via the secondary market as yields may fall five to 10 basis points,” said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income at Edelweiss Financial Services. “The new series could offer lower rates following the expected fall in the benchmark yield.”
 
 The benchmark yield on Monday rose six basis points to 7.86%, pushing prices down as an additional Rs 10,000 crore bond supply by the Reserve Bank of India added to the supply-side this week.
 
 But, good rains along with macro parameters will leave more rooms for the central bank for rate cuts this financial year. Lower interest rate in the market would pull bond yields lower. Also, the latest Greece debt deal has put a lid on speculation that the debt-ridden country would exit the European Union and prompt a market turmoil.
 
 On an average, the benchmark yield is expected to fall to the 7.50% level in the next three to six months, dealers said.
 
 Going by the incumbent benchmark yield as of now, an investor can earn as high as 7.25-7.5% by investing in the new series of tax-free bonds with 10-15-20 year maturities. Tax-free bonds will be priced after adding 45-80 basis points (varies on investor class and security rating) to the yield of similar-maturity sovereign bonds.
 
 “If the existing secondary market tax-free bond yields are near the 7.10-7.25% levels, it makes sense for HNIs (investing above Rs 10 lakh) to invest a portion of their money"", said Rupesh Bhansali, head-distribution at GEPL Capital.
 
 In the secondary market, 10-year triple-A rated tax-free bonds are yielding 7.15-7.25%. On 15-year paper, the yield is 7.25%.
 
 Yield on the National Highway Authorities of India’s 15-year tax-free bond has fallen five basis points in the past three weeks. Since the beginning of the financial year, this paper has seen transactions 15 times until July 9.

Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/tata-steel-q4-show-beats-estimates/articleshow/35138490.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel reported a consolidated profit of Rs 1,035.8 crore, beating market expectations, helped by higher sales volumes and better realisations in Europe and India. 

 Analysts, on an average, were expecting Tata Steel to report consolidated net profit of Rs 970.9 crore on sales of Rs 40,791.9 crore, according to a poll conducted by Bloomberg. The company reported a loss of Rs 6,529 crore during the same period last year, hurt by impairment charges. Sales rose 22% to Rs 42,428 crore from the same quarter last year. 

 Sales volumes grew to 7.6 million tonnes (MT) compared with 6.6 MT during the same quarter last year. Tata Steel board has recommended a dividend of Rs 10 a share for FY14. 

 Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortization (EBITDA) was Rs 4,917 crore from Rs 4,368 crore during same quarter last year. EBITDA per tonne rose in India and Europe but fell in South-East Asia. 

 Tata Steel Europe CEO Karl-Ulrich Köhler said that the Europe business is focussing on operating costs and will look to reduce costs through more internal measures. He acknowledged that the company continued to see pressure on margins. 

 “Europe is suffering from overcapacity, which means pricing power is limited. Since there was a decrease in raw material prices, the benefit of which will come with a lag effect, customers asked for lower prices,” Köhler said. Global iron-ore prices have fallen sharply in the last three months, putting downward pressure on steel prices. 

 Tata Steel Europe, known as Corus before the $13-billion buyout in 2007, accounts for more than half of Tata Steel’s total consolidated revenue. 

 The company, which has been severely hit by recession and overcapacity, has remained operationally positive for five straight quarters, driven by several restructuring measures and a slight uptick in demand in Europe. The company indicated at more restructuring in the coming year. 

 ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, showed ‘cautious optimism’ about the recovery in the continent about the business outlook for the rest of 2014, when it reported quarterly results last week. 

 Tata Steel is India’s largest private sector steelmaker by revenue. It has a production capacity of about 10 MT per annum in Jamshedpur and about 18 MT in Europe. The company is increasing steelmaking capacity in Kaliganagar, Odisha. The project will add about 3 MT in the first phase of expansion. 

 Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director, said the Kaliganagar will be commissioned this year. The company has already spent Rs 16,350 crore this year. However, on the impending interim order by the Supreme Court on illegal mining in Odisha, the company remained non-committal. “Each company has to be treated on merit. We are operating with all clearances. But as all good companies we have a plan B in place,” said Chatterjee. 

 He refused to elaborate on the plan. Gross debt rose to Rs 81,000 crore as on March 31, 2014 from Rs 76,500 crore three months back. On refinancing of debt, Chatterjee said: “it will happen, when it has to happen. We’ll take a call when it’s due.” Shares of the company jumped to a 22-month high and closed up 6% at Rs 452.15 per share on BSE on Wednesday.

  TOKYO: Shares in Japan's Suzuki Motor soared nearly five percent Wednesday after a newspaper report that it plans to shift part of its engine production abroad due to the strong yen.
  
  The automaker gained 4.91 percent to 1,945 yen in the afternoon, boosted by the report in the Asahi Shimbun.
  
  However, Suzuki denied the story, saying it had no plans to reduce its annual production of 800,000 engines for vehicles assembled at factories in Japan for domestic sales and exports.
  
  ""We have been saying we want to replace shipments of parts to Hungary and Indonesia to build engines there with local procurement, considering the yen's strength,"" a company spokesman said.
  
  ""The engine output (in Japan) will not be reduced from 800,000 unless domestic demand falls,"" he said.
  
  Nonetheless the Asahi report encouraged buying.
  
  ""It's positive in the sense that the company will be able to better address the impact from the stronger yen,"" a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm told Dow Jones Newswires.
  
  The manager added the Japan's monetary easing Tuesday also led to buy-backs of Suzuki as investors had recently been cautious amid worries of overheating in the fast-growing Indian market, in which it boasts a 50 percent share.
  
  The company also faces increased domestic competition as Toyota Motor announced plans to enter the mini-car market.

  Deepak Mohoni: The Sterlite ADR expectedly took a beating in the US and its in the news for negative reasons so its very unlikely to pick up today unless some large body decides to pick up large stakes in the stock.
  
  It would seem unlikely that would happen. Sterlite was not doing frightfully well before all this business anyway.

Maran makes open offer for SpiceJet,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/maran-makes-open-offer-for-spicejet/articleshow/6048600.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maran makes open offer for SpiceJet,"
  NEW DELHI: Sun TV Network promoter Kalanithi Maran has offered to buy 20% stake in SpiceJet from the public at Rs 57.76 each. If successful, it will give him majority stake, allowing him to go ahead with plans of rebranding the no frills airline.
  
  This follows a deal where Mr Maran in his individual capacity agreed to acquire 37.7% stake in Delhi-based budget airline from the promoter of the firm besides financial investor Wilbur Ross for around Rs 739 crore. He will have to shell out Rs 479 crore to buy the additional 20% stake.
  
  The open offer price is at 4.7% premium on the Monday’s closing price of Rs 55.15. The domestic airline, which now has permission to fly overseas to Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal, witnessed hectic trading of shares which soared over 6% in early morning trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It touched an intra-day high of Rs 59.55, only to close 1.61% lower from the last traded price on Friday. The open offer has been made by Kal Airways, a private firm promoted by Mr Maran and his wife Kaveri. It will open on August 6 and close on August 25.
  
  The new promoters propose to change the name of SpiceJet after completing the acquisition, which is expected to close next year. They also plan to shift its registered office from Gurgaon in Haryana to down South.
  
  Meanwhile, one of the co-promoters of the airline, Ajay Singh, who holds around 5% stake in the airlines said on Monday that he does not wish to exit at this point and will stay put in the budget carrier as the prospects are bright for low-cost carriers in the country. SpiceJet had reported a revenue of Rs 2,242 crore and a profit of Rs 61.4 crore for the year ended March 2010.

  CK Narayan, President Treasury, Sharyans Resources, in a chat with ET Now talks about SpiceJet.
  
  
  What is the call on SpiceJet?
   
  It has been into a very strong downtrend for quite a while and slammed down into supports near the 41-42 area. We did see a very large volume upside move from the lows today. So it is very clear that there are interests in buyers somewhere in the 40 to 42 region and that would remain a decent level of support to buy in. 
  
  I would not really chase this stock but looking at the very strong decline that we have had, certain bit of an upward bounce is not unrealistic and since the stock has been into a lower top lower bottom formation from somewhere in let’s say 97 levels to 42 levels, a decent pullback is on the cards. Stock is a decent bet, your risk levels are very close by. So with a target of about 65-67, this is a buy.

 Even after excluding the one-off income from sale and leaseback of aircraft and engine warranty claims, the Chennai-based airline has reported profits, mainly due to higher passenger traffic. Moreover, the performance follows five consecutive quarters of losses. 

 SpiceJet recorded a net profit of Rs 54.6 crore for the June quarter, compared with a net loss of Rs 71 crore a year ago, on the back of a 26% growth in passenger traffic. 

 The airline also witnessed a significant improvement in revenue per passenger, to Rs 4,068 from Rs 3,283 a year ago, which helped its net sales grow 51% to Rs 1,406 crore in Q1. Going ahead, it would be vital for SpiceJet to boost regional connectivity.

ET Now: NBFCs what do you do you speak to any company a small cap company like TFCI which in the investor conference yesterday guided very well. You were speaking to Capital First and the management comes on air tomorrow to speak about their future and they are sounding positive as well. Similarly for an SKS Micro. So almost every NBFC is talking very positively for the next couple of years at least. Do you have any preferences in this space do you like them at all? 

 
Dipan Mehta: I have mentioned on this channel as well that we have a preference for SKS Micro and within the NBFC space, there is a great deal of potential but investors are better off trying to venture into NBFCs which are specialised like SKS Micro into Microfinance and then there is Bajaj Finance and other company which we have an interest in.
 
 The same with Capital First which is more into SME funding. So wherever there are specialised NBFCs ,those will benefit because of the underlying volume growth that they are able to achieve, another segment of the NBFCs which is very interesting and lots of ideas over there would be the housing finance companies starting right from LIC Housing to Repco. 

 So on the whole, we are quite positive on the NBFC sector and they have demonstrated good growth rates, some amount of regulatory overhang also has got discounted with the new RBI norms for NBFCs. We have checked a lot of the companies are not getting affected as much as was thought earlier. So on the whole, it is great going for NBFCs and from shareholder point of view over the next three-four years.

As opposed to this, cement realisation of companies in the rest of the country has been erratic and in most cases, it has fallen.   	After following operational discipline due to overcapacity for a long time, south-based cement companies increased cement prices given the scope of new demand following the creation of two new states -Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is anticipated that there would be an incremental cement demand of 23 million tonnes (MT) which is higher than 20 MT which united Andhra Pradesh had during peak cement cycle.  	As a result, cement prices in south increased by Rs 20-50 per 50 kg bag in the September quarter. In contrast, with the exception of western region -where cement prices jumped in the range of Rs 20-40 per 50 kg bag - cement prices in North, East and Central regions have either declined or remained range bound due to weak demand.  	At present, cement utilisation in the South is in the range of 55-58% as opposed to 80% in the rest of India. As momentum in demand picks up in the region, cement prices are expected to rise in the coming quarters. 	 	 	 "

The overseas subsidiaries had been hit hard by the economic turmoil over the past 18 months, but have now started looking up. However, following the company’s failed attempt at acquiring Geiger Tech in Germany, which filed for bankruptcy, Sintex is likely to write off its initial investment of E7 million (approx Rs 46 crore) during the current financial year.For the December quarter, the company reported a 3.4% growth in consolidated net sales to Rs 848 crore. However, rising raw material costs impacted its operating margin leading to a situation where its PBDIT is now below the year ago level. The company shaved off close to one-thirds of its interest costs by replacing high cost loans, which helped its pre-tax profit inch up 3.5% to Rs 98.8 crore. Its textiles business grossly underperformed during the quarter with a 6% dip in sales and 67% fall in profits. In comparison, the plastics segment performed well with a double-digit profit growth against the year-ago period. Sintex Industries’ December 2009 quarter financial performance failed to impress investors, as its shares dipped 0.8% to close at Rs 269 on BSE. The scrip, which has underperformed the Sensex during the past year, is now being valued at 12 times its consolidated earnings for the past 12 months.The company reported improving capacity utilisation rates across businesses, which can help boost higher revenues, going forward. With over one-thirds of its annual profits typically generated in the last quarter, the March 2010 quarter numbers could be substantially better. The company is also carrying a war chest of around Rs 800 crore of cash, initially raised to fund an acquisition, which could add an unexpected boost to growth."

Its focus on cost controls and better project management is reflected in its financials.
 
 The company’s operating margins in the first half of FY14 improved to 6.5 per cent against the last six-quarter average of 3.7 per cent, though revenue growth slipped by 7 per cent.
 
 Siemens India’s financial year ends in September. In the past few quarters, the firm posted divergent margins, from as low as 1 per cent in the third quarter of FY13 to as high as 13 per cent in the second quarter of FY12.
 
 Analysts believe the main reason for such variance is its high exposure to currency risk.
 
 The company imports most of its raw material. Besides internal controls to boost margins, the company is also re-negotiating with its customers on price.
 
 Post the March earnings, the management stated there’s still significant amount of under-cutting to grab orders, and the difference between the lowest bidder and the next possible one ranges between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
 
 Adding to the woes of capital goods firms are the trade terms, which seem skewed in favour of the buyer, resulting in stretched payment schedules . The company says it will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and ignore lossmaking orders.
 
 The attempt by the firm to focus on profitable volumes has led to a slide in order inflow growth as it stays away from loss-making orders. The order inflow declined by 4 per cent to Rs 4,620 crore in the first half of FY14 against Rs 4,790 crore in the same period last year.
 
 It continues to see a decline in order inflow from infrastructure and energy, which contributed 48 per cent to total revenue in the March quarter. The order backlog stands at Rs 12,900 crore at the end of March 2014.
 
 Despite the stock appreciating by 41 per cent in the last six months, 73 per cent of analysts tracking it, have put a ‘sell’ call on it, influenced by its P/E ratio.
 
 According to Bloomberg, earnings per share (EPS) for the next year is expected at Rs 16.23, which means the stock is currently trading at a P/E of 47.5 times of one-year forward earnings.
 
 Given the headwinds of a demand environment and cut-throat competition, a 47 times of P/E for a stock like Siemens India appears to be quite expensive for investors. On earnings, net profit climbed 185 per cent to Rs 88.29 crore in the March quarter, while revenue declined by 8 per cent to Rs 2,706 crore on a y-o-y basis. The drop in revenue is mainly the result of clients deferring deliveries.

It closed 5% up at Rs. 408.10 on Wednesday after reporting its second consecutive quarter of net profit, after remaining in the red for the previous three.
 
 For the October-December period, the firm posted a net profit of Rs. 22.4 crore against a loss of Rs. 2.9 crore a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to Rs. 139.8 crore.
 
 Instead of cutting back or waiting for the external climate to change, Shreyas increased capacity, while simultaneously reducing cost per tonne of cargo. It sold two old vessels and replaced them with newer, larger and more fuel-efficient ships.
 
 “The strategic and decisive actions by the board resulted in this strong turnaround. Newer vessels and better capacity utilisation on higher cargo from transshipment and domestic market helped,“ said chairman and managing director Ramesh S Ramakrishnan.
 
 Shreyas did not attribute the turnaround to any significant rise in demand, but mostly to its internal change in strategy . It increased capacity utilisation by venturing into non-container cargo, like steel coils. That helped it increase utilisation of empty vessels on return journeys. The company hopes to buy more vessels going forward.
 
 Last year rating agency Crisil had expressed concern about volatility in bunker costs and slow growth of container traffic in India resulting in low utilisation of its fleet. Both these issues have been resolved to a great extent by falling fuel price, more efficient vessels and higher utilization rate.
 
 ""It is not a recent story. The company has been able to consistently improve its earnings in the last three quarters. Even the first quarter for the year would have been profitable without a one-time expense,"" said an analyst, who refused to be named. Shreyas' market cap stands at Rs. 268.83 crore.
 
 Coastal shipping — which commands a significant share of trade in the US, China and Europe — accounts for just 7% of the country's total domestic cargo transport network even as India has a coastline of more than 7,500 km.

  Once the budget is over, Educomp generally tends to decline but now it is broadly in the range of about Rs 400 to Rs 520. 
  
  On Bajaj Hindustan, upside seems to be limited. Most of these stocks were showing good momentum but now are broadly range bound between about Rs 60 and Rs 80 on Bajaj Hindustan. 
  
  There was a news expected on retail which never came through. So, Shoppers Stop has been ranging between Rs 320 and Rs 380. In case it is able to close below Rs 320, you probably may find levels of Rs 260, but generally it is a low volume stock and does not tend to do much but below Rs 320. There could be some Rs 40-50 downside.

 Sesa Sterlite shares reached an intra-day high of Rs 191.50 on the NSE after opening at Rs 188. 

 Norwegian government has asked its sovereign wealth fund, Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), not to invest in Indian company Sesa Sterlite and two Israeli firms citing ethical issues. 

 The GPFG, estimated to be worth over USD 800 billion, is one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. 

 ""Sesa Sterlite is a newly established subsidiary of Vedanta. The Council's assessment is that the relevant operations in India, which are currently run through the company Sesa Sterlite, present an unacceptable risk of environmental damage and serious violations of human rights,"" the statement said. 

 The Council of Ethics has regularly updated its assessment of Vedanta and the basis for exclusion is still considered to be present. 

 In accordance with the Council's recommendation, the Finance Ministry has decided to exclude Sesa Sterlite from the Fund's investment universe as well as to maintain the exclusion of Vedanta, it added. 

 ""The recommendation builds on an earlier recommendation to exclude the company Vedanta Resources Ltd (Vedanta) and two of its subsidiaries, which operate in India. The Ministry followed the Council's recommendation to exclude Vedanta and its two subsidiaries in 2007,"" the statement had said.

The bank’s London branch has raised the bond issue rated as BBB-. 

 Deutsche Bank was the sole investment banker for the issue, which was priced at 2.83%. The coupon is derived after adding 144 basis points over and above the five-year US treasury yields. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. 

 Praveen Kumar Gupta, DMD and CFO, SBI, has confirmed the matter. “This was a foreign borrowing for lending overseas only. It was through a normal borrowing route,” he told ET. 

 Those offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. With higher demand for Indian papers, the spread or gap, over and above the US treasury yields has contracted. However, US sovereign yields have gone up as prices have fallen with investors expecting US rate hikes sometime in June-July. 

 “We are getting an increased number of queries from institutional investors for Indian top-rated bonds,” said an investment banker engaged in offshore bond sales. 

 Earlier in February, India’s largest private sector company by revenue Reliance Industries raised $750 million by selling 30-year maturity offshore bonds. The yield spread was at 262.5 bps while US treasury yields had dipped to record lows as prices moved up. The final yield came at 4.875%. 

 Nearly two weeks prior to that, the company had mopped up $1 billion through similar bond sales but with 10-year maturity at 4.125%.

Mid- and small-cap stocks outperformed their larger peers in the special session, which is held to mark the beginning of the traditional new year.
 
 BSE’s Sensesx rose 63.24 points, or 0.24 per cent, to close at 26850.47. NSE’s Nifty gained 15.55 points, or 0.19 per cent, to close at 8011.45 on Thursday. Among the broadmarket indices, BSE’s mid-cap index gained 1 per cent and the small-cap index rose 1.5 per cent. Financial markets will be shut on Friday on account of Diwali. In commodities futures, turnover in gold and silver rose on the commodity exchange MCX.
 
 Usually, it is the trader community, which participates in the Muhurat trading session. They enter small token trades with an intention to book profits as making money in this hour of trading is considered auspicious. This could be the reason for the activity in mid-caps. But mid- and small-cap shares on the Muhurat trading session may not repeat their recent strong performance in Samvat 2071 as many of them are considered expensively valued after the recent rally. So far in 2014, mid-cap index has gained 44 per cent and small-cap index has gained 63 per cent.
 
 “In Samvat 2071, only quality stocks which are moderately valued will outperform the broader market and investors should not expect much from overvalued mid- & small-cap stocks,” said Nilesh Shah, MD and CEO, Axis Capital.
 
 Samvat 2070, which ended on Wednesday, has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The Sensex has risen over 26 per cent in this period.
 
 Brokers and investors are expecting similar returns this Samvat as the government has embarked on market-friendly measures to bolster the economy. But the road is unlikely to be smooth. Global markets are facing stiff hurdles from the euro zone, where concerns of a recession have resurfaced.
 
 Also, the era of easy global money may be coming to an end soon with the US Fed expected to increase interest rates mid-2015. There are worries that the flood of foreign institutional investor (FIIs) flows, which pushed up stock prices, may ebb once the Fed tightens its monetary policy. Though central banks in Europe and Japan continue to keep interest rates at near-zero levels, investors are not sure how much of that money would flow into emerging markets like India.
 
 For Indian stocks, the next big event will be the Union Budget for the financial year 2015-16. Investors are expecting the government to step on the gas on the reforms process with key state elections out of the way.

  The crop protection major, Sabero Organics Gujarat (SOGL), has done exceedingly well on the bourses following its improved financial performance. Its stock has more than doubled in a span of one year, way ahead of the benchmark Sensex performance.
  
  SOGL’s profit for the fourth quarter more than tripled to Rs 7.1 crore, despite a 3% dip in the net sales at Rs 96.5 crore. Operating margin saw a 300-bps improvement to 15% as costs of raw material consumed fell 28%. 
  
  The performance of its domestic business improved in FY10. Domestic sales for the whole year grew 40% to Rs 180 crore representing 42% of the total sales of the company as against just 34% last year. In the case of its exports division, the sales also grew in the Americas region while Asia, Europe and Africa reported a drastic fall in sales.
  
  The proportion of debt in SOGL’s capital structure also got reduced during the year on account of a 15% equity dilution over the year and an 88% growth in net profit. Its debt-equity ratio dropped from 1.03 a year ago to 0.71.
  
  With more than 240 product registrations, Sabero operates on a wide network of distributors and agents in 50 countries. The company has its subsidiaries in Argentina, Europe, Australia and Brazil, with Europe and Brazil being the main focus areas to obtain registrations. The company is further expanding its international presence in the geographies of Costa Rica, Venezuela, the Philippines, Guatemala, Cameroon and Argentina. 
  
  The company is currently in the process of setting up an export-oriented plant of technical active ingredients at Dahej in Gujarat with an estimated capacity of 2650 tonnes per annum by December 2010. The capital cost of Rs 55 crore will be financed by a combination of $9-million external commercial borrowings and internal accruals. 
  
  Also, the company plans to increase the capacity of its Chloropyriphos plant by 50% until September 2010. Moreover, it is set to launch two new fungicides and two herbicides in the first half of FY11.
  
  It has announced a final dividend at the rate of Rs 1.20 per share for the year, which works out to a dividend yield of 1.6% at the current market price of Rs 73. This is 5.5 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share. Given the company’s expansion plans, its growth prospects appear attractive for the future.

Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/steep-appreciation-in-rupee-to-lower-oil-subsidies/articleshow/16591247.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,"MUMBAI: A steep appreciation in rupee is likely to help reduce India’s oil subsidies substantially. The rupee-dollar exchange rate recently dropped below the 200 day moving average (DMA), which is regarded as significant by technical analysts.
 
 A report by Emkay’s predicted the trend to continue further till the exchange rate reaches 51.9 — another 1.5% appreciation. This can knock off Rs 25,000 crore of under-recoveries for the petroleum industry in the remaining 6 months of FY13.
 
 Just a few weeks back India was looking at a fuel subsidy bill exceeding Rs 2 lakh crore or 2% of the country’s GDP. The recent increase in diesel prices, cap on LPG cylinders and tax changes is estimated to cut this down by Rs 25000 crore. But the recent rupee appreciation, if sustained, would knock off additional Rs 25000 crore from the under-recovery estimate over next 6 months
 
 The daily under-recovery of petroleum industry was estimated at Rs 498 crore for the second half of September 2012 in spite of the diesel price hike in the first half. This was at an average import price of Rs 6350 per barrel of India’s crude basket.
 
 Since then, the import price of Indian crude basket has fallen to Rs 5700 per barrel thanks to a 6.7% drop in international crude prices and 3.7% appreciation in rupee.
 
 
 
  
 
 Assuming this level remains stable through the remaining 6 months of FY13, the total under-recovery for the whole of FY13 — including Rs 84,000 crore for the first six months of the fiscal till September — would drop below Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
 
 The impact of such a drastic fall in subsidy bill would be improvement in risk profile of the country for foreign investors. This will lead to more forex flows and lead to a further improvement in rupee. Rupee’s appreciation would also make imports cheaper thereby tempering the domestic inflation, which is another economic challenge for the economy.

  Official figures released on Friday said 2,13,09,532 tonnes of rice have been procured by the various government agencies upto Thursday, with Punjab leading the States. Buys by the state government stood at 86,33,706 tonnes of followed by Chhatisgarh and Andhra Pradesh at 27,82,753 tonne. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh bought 16,57,437 tonnes and 16,54,640 tonnes respectively.
  
  Food Corporation of India (FCI) had procured 21.88 mt of rice in the year-ago period. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) chairman and MD Siraj Hussain had estimated that government rice buys would reach 32 mt in the 2010-11 marketing year starting October this year, beating the target of 31 mt, despite drought in some parts of Bihar and UP. Compared to this, government agencies had procured 31.47 mt of rice in 2009-10 marketing year (October-September). According to the second advance estimates released by the ministry earlier this month, rice output is projected to surge to 94.01 mt this year against 89.13 mt last crop year (july-june). Last year, rice output had declined by over 10 mt due to drought in 2009-10 crop year.
  
   India, the world's second largest rice producer, produced a record 99.18 million tonnes of rice in 2008-09.

  The performance of Religare Enterprises in the December quarter was disappointing. However, its recent acquisitions are expected to drive its growth in the coming quarters. The strong 74% growth in the consolidated revenue did not trickle down to profits since the company did not get support from its asset management and investment banking business segments. 
  
  Its lending business, which drives almost half of its consolidated revenues, saw the interest yields contracting. Coupled with rising interest rates, this led to a 42% fall in the net profit for the segment. Further, its subsidiaries re-ported a combined loss of Rs 87.4 crore. Therefore, the company re-ported a loss of Rs 98.5 crore against a profit of Rs 21.5 crore a year ago on a consolidated basis. However, the company is taking various initiatives to drive business growth. 
  
  Its key global asset management and investment banking divisions have seen a spate of acquisitions . For instance, the global asset management business acquired Northgate Capital and Landmark Partners in 2010. This has given the company access to assets under management of $11.3 billion (Rs 56,000 crore) along with greater capabilities in primary and secondary private equity, venture capital and real estate segment. Its investment banking business acquired three companies in the December quarter. 
  
  Besides providing geographical diversification, these acquisitions would help in reducing the turn around time in the regions . Investment banking business is relationship driven. Once the integration with the target companies completes, the company would be able to fully capitalise on the target’s relationships. This would help the company in generating profits at a fast pace. 
  
  Moreover, the effect of rising interest rates on its lending business would fade away, as almost 62% of its financing book is floating rate in nature. Hence, the increase would be passed on to the borrowers. While the company has invested heavily in its key driving businesses, the future growth depends upon how fast the company finishes the integration with the acquired companies.

  REC, after hitting that high of 290 yesterday today it seeing a bit of a downward bias its almost down about 1% and volumes also seem to be drying up though it is above its 200 DMA. What is the kind of outlook that you have on this stock?
  
  Well the stock is an excellent long term uptrend. It didn't fall very much during the markets correction of the last month or so. 
  
  Today's fall isn't keeping with market conditions. I would not think this fall will last very long either for the market or for REC so even REC could be picked up into a bit of a decline and keep a stop loss about a 1%-2% down from here that should workout reasonably well.

  We are very bullish on RComm. We are looking for targets of 220-225 possibly with a two week timeframe on RComm and the stop loss on this trade would be closer to 168 or 169. 
  
  Again in the same space, we also like MTNL around 70 odd levels right now with a stop loss of around 65. We would look for targets closer to 80 or 80 from the upside with a two week timeframe. So in the telecom space, at least the ignored ones really look good.

In the past few days, a spurt in rains in western Rajasthan has accelerated pulses sowing in the state, kindling hopes of recovering pulses acreage deficit.
 
 According to the latest sowing data, the total coverage under pulses is 74.48 lakh hectare as against 89.34 lakh hectare last year in the corresponding period.
 
 Out of the overall deficit of 14.86 lakh hectare, Rajasthan alone accounts for 12.6 lakh hectare.
 
 “Rajasthan contributes 45% of the total moong production in the country. If pulses sowing picks up, we can recover the deficit in pulses. Moong, which takes only 2 months for harvesting, can be sown till August 15,” agriculture secretary Ashish Bahuguna told ET.
 
 The pulses area is also likely to replace the acreage targeted for coarse cereals, which is dismally down due to deficient rains in the major coarse grain growing states of Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
 The area under coarse cereal is 140.89 lakh hectare as against 175.14 lakh hectare last year. “Most of these areas will be covered by pulses and fodder crops. Farmers usually divert to going pulses and fodder crops if nothing grows as pulses need less water and the life cycle is short,” said IMD chief LS Rathore.
 
 The government has a programme in place to achieve more than 19 million tonnes of pulse production.

Precious metals shine as EMs lose lustre,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/precious-metals-shine-as-ems-lose-lustre/articleshow/30758200.cms,m.economictimes.com,Precious metals shine as EMs lose lustre,"With the US Federal indicating in its January meeting that there’s a clear presumption in favour of trimming bond purchases by $10 billion at each meeting, there has been another round of slide in emerging market currencies, but this has brought the shine back in metals, especially gold and silver. 

 Both metals had, in fact, outperformed the MSCI World and the MSCI Emerging Index by a huge margin on a yearto-date basis. Gold has returned 9% in 2014 so far, which is one of highest returns on a YTD basis since 1983, while silver gained 11%. 

 The equity index has largely been flat, or 3-4% negative on a YTD basis. The crucial factor that bought the sheen back to metals is the re-emergence of ‘risk on’ trade and investors moving out of equity instruments. In the age of flight to safety, money pulled out of emerging markets on ‘increased country risk’ is being invested back in gold/silver. 
  
 The trades, based on the notion of ‘sell emerging markets and buy metals’ which led to the spread between MSCI Emerging Markets and gold spot, reversed on heightened risk perception from January 23, this year.

  In a chat with ET Now, Devang Visaria, Chief Strategist, devangvisaria.com, shares his views on the outlook of Pipavav Shipyard.
  
  
  What should one do with Pipavav Shipyard? If you had bought the stock at the Rs 80 levels, would you advise booking out or if you have not got into the stock, would you initiate a long at these levels?
   
  The first part is pretty easy because if you had got in at Rs 80, then you could possibly take some profits off the table but on a two or three week of basis, the stock looks likely to have more upsides from these levels also. Possibly Rs 105-110 are good targets with two or three week kind of horizon for Pipavav Shipyard. You could look to add to quantities if you do not have it. At these levels, you could buy with a stop loss below Rs 85. You could just accumulate this stock at these levels again at Rs 88-90 range. Rs 105-110 is a good target for Pipavav on the upside.

What would your view be on Sun Pharma essentially because Ranbaxy is just a derivative of that now? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: By and large, I have been quite positive on the pharma space, especially those which are exporting to the United States of America because along with IT, these two sectors should do much better other than the domestics in this FY15 and FY16 as well. So for me these will be more positive sectors where the visibility is more assured than what we are seeing because on the domestic side, you are seeing more and more uncertainty. There is more and more risk building up. So for me, I would definitely go for the pharma sector and Sun Pharma would be one of those companies.

  The Pune-based software product development services company Persistent Systems benefits from its presence in niche areas of emerging technologies. Also, with its newly-adopted strategy to partner with large firms such as IBM and CISCO, etc., to offer services to bigger clients is likely to benefit the company.
  
  Persistent offers solutions in telecom, infrastructure and systems and life sciences space. Since September 2010, the company has forayed into cloud computing, analytics, enterprise mobility and enterprise collaboration.
  
  Over the past few quarters, the company posted single digit sequential growth in its topline. However, on the back of higher operating costs, operating profit margin dropped to 17-19%, from over 20% level. The company’s management has expressed caution over the global demand scenario.
  
  With lower number of working days, the December quarter is expected to be a weak contributor to annual revenue. The company has revised the revenue guidance for the fiscal downwards to $205-210 million against $220 million earlier. Net profit is expected to be in the range of Rs 125-135 crore. At the higher end, this is 10% lower than the profit recorded last year.
  
  The sharp depreciation in the rupee against the dollar would also have an adverse impact since the company has covered $103.5 million of its future revenue at a rate lower than the current prevailing dollar exchange rate of over Rs 52.6.
  
  The company’s new three-way strategy, which includes expansion of the existing client base, building services on technology platforms and enhancing high-margin intellectual property (IP) business, is likely to improve its profitability. IP and emerging technology are expected to be the future growth drivers. The company’s stock has dropped by over 30% in the past year. At the current market price of Rs 299, the stock is trading at 5.5 times its earnings for the trailing twelve months, cheaper than similar-size industry rivals, which are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 6-8 currently.

ONGC: Subsidy burden takes a toll; stock up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ongc-subsidy-burden-takes-a-toll-stock-up/articleshow/8659527.cms,m.economictimes.com,ONGC: Subsidy burden takes a toll; stock up,"
  Government-owned ONGC reported more than 60% sequential decline in net profit in January-March as it gave away about two-third of its oil revenues to subsidise losses of retailers amid soaring crude prices, reviving memories of fiscal 2008-09 when global crude peaked pushing up subsidies on fuel. 
  
  At 10:53 am, shares of ONGC were trading 0.77 per cent up at Rs 280.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The huge sequential fall in earnings stands in sharp contrast to private sector explorers such as Cairn India, which reported 22% growth in net profit helped by higher prices even though production fell. 
  
  ONGC's share in subsidy at Rs 12,135 crore in the fourth quarter was almost equal to the total of past three quarters. This took the total subsidy toll to Rs 24,892 crore for fiscal 2010-11, more than double than previous year. 
  
  In January-March, although ONGC earned an average oil price of $108.90 per barrel, it ended up with just $38.75 in hand as the government took away the rest. What remained was nearly 25% below the year-ago period causing a 26% fall in net profit. 
  
  State-run fuel retailers sell products such as diesel and cooking gas to end-customers at subsidised rates. The subsidy burden arising from selling the products below market price is shared between retailers, upstream companies, and the government. 
  
  The company reported net profit of Rs 2,791 crore in the last quarter driven by higher profits on natural gas, whose prices were revised in fiscal 2010-11, and increasing share of production from joint ventures. As there is no subsidy burden on production from joint ventures, the 60% incremental volumes helped. 
  
  Although oil prices have jumped more than five times since 2004-05, ONGC's average profit growth has been a mere 6.5% per annum. The average annual growth in its market capitalisation was just about 4.5%. Every year, the government has taken away a chunk of its profits to pay for losses made by oil marketing companies. 
  
  The subsidy sharing mechanism and its value-destructing impact will keep weighing on investor sentiment. The government is expected to divest its stake further in the company in early July. 
  
  This could induce the government to introduce some reforms for a better price. Investors, who are otherwise living off the annual dividend payouts, may look forward to a run-up in prices if the follow-on offer materialises.

 Exports of rapeseed meal during April-July showed a quantum jump of 77 per cent at 8,51,212 tonnes compared to 4,79,572 tonnes following a record crop and crushing which led to high processing, availability and exports, SEA said. 

 Currently, India ships rapeseed meal to South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and other Far East Countries at USD 295 FOB (Freight On Board) India, while rapeseed Hamburg ex-mill is at USD 376. 

 FOB is used when liability and ownership of goods is transferred from a seller to a buyer. 

 SEA further stated that soybean meal export is at the lowest level as Indian shipment is still outpriced in the international market. 

 Current price of soybean meal FOB Kandla (Gujarat) is quoted at USD 675 per tonne, while soybean meal Argentina CIF Rotterdam is quoted at USD 548 per tonne and Brazil at USD 534 per tonne. 

 Meanwhile, export of castor meal has marginally declined at 22,401 tonnes and rice bran extraction is maintained at the same level at 45,225 tonnes compared to the same period of last year. 

 South Korea was the major importer of oil meals from India during April-July with 4,24,719 tonnes compared to 2,77,034 tonnes during the same period of last year, which included 3,55,280 tonnes of rapeseed meal, 55,719 tonnes of castor seed meal and 13,720 tonnes of soybean meal.

 Thailand imported 1,56,821 tonnes of oil meals compared to 1,17,388 tonnes during the first four months of 2021, consisting of 1,55,835 tonnes of rapeseed meal and 986 tonnes of soybean meal. 

 Bangladesh sourced rapeseed meal and rice bran extraction from India and imported 1,44,667 tonnes of oil meals compared to 1,23,741 tonnes, including 31,672 tonnes of rice bran extractions and 1,12,991 tonnes of rapeseed meal.

  What are your thoughts on Nirma?
   
  It has a very strong resistance at 255, just going by the technicals. So if it were to get past 255, then possibly the next target is 300-325 on the upside. Right now, 220 would be a very strong support. That is a range - 220 to 230 - where you can look to buy this stock and possibly look for targets of 300 on the upside.

  MUMBAI: Nirma Ltd on Monday soared nearly 18 per cent to hit one-year high on the Bombay Stock Exchange in early trade, driven by the detergent maker's decision to delist shares.
  
  The company, on Saturday, said that it would delist shares from the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange, and will acquire the entire non-promoter holding in the firm.
  
  Shares of the Ahmedabad-based company started zoomed by 17.99 per cent, touching a 52-week peak of Rs 264.85 in the morning trade on BSE.

The counter is buzzing following a turnaround in the company’s performance in the past two quarters. The stock has been up over the past one month.The scrip has gained 41% in one month, notwithstanding the sluggishness in the broader market. The benchmark Sensex posted a modest return of 2.7% during the period. Nilkamal’s performance on the bourses stands out taking into account the returns for the three months, six months and one year.For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 64%, and it has more than trebled in six months. The Sensex returns lagged behind in each of these periods. Compared to the year-ago level, its current price of Rs 245 is four times higher. Nilkamal, which grossed Rs 564 crore in the past four quarters in revenue, manufactures injection moulding products, including home furniture. It had posted net losses in the second half of FY09. The trend, however, has reversed since then. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters. This was largely aided by a significant drop in raw material prices due to a relative softening in prices of petrochemical intermediaries, including polyethylene and polypropylene. As a result, input costs as a percentage of sales fell sharply from 71% a year ago to 59% in the September.Lower costs have resulted in improved profitability. From the lows of 7% in the March 2009 quarter, operating margin expanded to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. At the current price, the scrip commands a P/E multiple of 15 on a trailing 12-month basis. Other injection moulding makers, including Supreme Industries and Wim Plast, are trading at a P/E of nine and seven, respectively. Nilkamal’s higher valuations partly reflect its financial recovery and its expansion plans for plastics retail. The company is investing in its own retail chain under the name @Home across the country. In the September 2009 quarter, it opened two new stores under this brand. At the current level, the stock seems to fully reflect its future potential to expand."

  The aluminium major has approved 1:1 bonus, that is one bonus share for each share held, while taking into account the Q3 results in its Board Meeting held on January 31.
  
  “There has been consistent demand by shareholders to give bonus keeping the profit and heavy reserves in mind.

  The company registered impressive results both in sales and profit for 2010-11, a company statement said here.
  
  According to the audited financial results for the year 2010-11, taken on record by the Board of Directors in a meeting held in New Delhi today, NALCO has posted net profit of Rs 1069.30 crore, registering an increase of 31 per cent over previous year's figure of Rs 814.22 crore.
  
  Similarly, the sales turnover of Rs 5958.98 crore, also showed a rise of 18 per cent, from Rs 5054.73 crore achieved in the previous fiscal.
  
  ""The results would have been still better but for the adverse impact of exchange rate of rupee on sales, which made a dent of Rs 159 crore,"" a senior executive said.
  
  The rise in net profit and sales turnover is mostly attributed to better market realisations, in addition to some contributions by way of higher production and sale of metal.
  
  During the year, average sales realization per tonne of alumina has gone up to USD 350 from USD 264 in 2009-10. Similarly, average sales realization per tonne of aluminium metal jumped to USD 2335 from USD 1946 in the previous year.

  Let’s start with your No. 1 stock idea for next 6 months for our viewers.
   
  My first recommendation is Munjal Auto. Munjal Auto is a Hero Group company which is managed by Sudhir Munjal. It is an automobile ancillary company catering mainly to the 2 wheeler industry. 
  
  This company’s main products are muffler, second is motorcycle rims and third one is scooter wheels. This company has 3 factories. One at Baroda, second at Haryana and third one is at Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Equity capital of this company is 10 crores. 
  
  In the year 2010-2011, this company made a turnover of Rs 521 crores and they made a gross profit of Rs 40 crores and net profit of Rs 25 crores. So on an equity capital of Rs 10 crores, the earning per share was Rs 25. 
  
  The company's management believes in rewarding the investors and hence they have declared Rs 7.5 as dividend. In the current year, in the first 9 months, the company has achieved a turnover of Rs 500 crores and gross of Rs 41 crores and net profit of Rs 30 crores. So one can see that the company has achieved more profit than what is achieved in the last full year.

  How does Mundra Port look on the charts?
   
  Mundra Port corrected quite a bit in the last one month. It has come down about 10-11%, which is much heavier than the index. But today's move looks quite interesting. It is straight off to about a week's high and if this sustains, then that could be pretty much the end of the correction. Otherwise the long-term chart of this stock looks pretty decent. It bottomed out in February. It did not have much of a bear market. So, there seems to be an excellent amount for the stock certainly at around Rs 130, that's held out very nicely for quite a while now and we are not too far above that level. So, if somebody likes the stock, this is not too bad an opportunity to get in, as I said the medium-term correction maybe just about coming to an end now.

  MUMBAI: The 21% net profit growth that Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) posted for the December 2010 quarter could have been better if the heavy forex gains of last year were not taken into account. Hence, the company’s performance should not be judged from the reaction of stock market.
  
  The MRPL scrip got a severe beating on Wednesday as it fell more than 8% to its 52-week low in spite of a healthy December quarter show. 
  
  At the operational level, the company’s performance was much better, with gross refining margins at $6 per barrel and highest ever throughput of 3.49 million tonne. 
  
  The company’s operating profit grew 87% against the year-ago period. However, the Rs 153-crore foreign exchange gains it had booked last December meant that the growth in gross profit was just 14%. 
  
  Another factor that affected profit growth during the quarter was the provisions for pay revisions of non-managerial staff. The company wrote off Rs 56 crore during the quarter towards arrears of pay revisions with effect from April 2007.
  
  The company is working on a mega-investment programme, which will almost triple its gross block by end FY12. It is implementing a Rs 14,000-crore refinery expansion project to be completed by October. This will not only expand its refining capacity from 12 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes, but also improve its ability to process cheaper varieties of crude oil, which are heavier or with higher sulphur content. 
  
  Another major project will add 0.44 million tonnes of polypropylene capacity by April 2012 at a capital cost of Rs 1,800 crore.
  
  MRPL is also working with ONGC to set up an aromatics complex in a special economic zone near its refinery in Mangalore. The Rs 5,750-crore project is scheduled to be commissioned by end FY13. 
  
  Considering the recent fall in market value and gains in corporate earnings, the company’s valuations dipped to a price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 12.3. The global refining industry appears to have come out of the woods with gross refining margins, or the money a refiner makes on refining each barrel of crude oil, moving up in the December quarter. The first few weeks of the March 2011 quarter indicate that the strength continues, which can prove a key positive for the company going ahead.

But, in Q1, cost of petroleum derivatives had come down. The company incurred higher cost on employees and depreciation charges due to the capex.
  
  Interest charges halved to Rs 11.72 crore ( Rs 22.78 crore). Export earnings remained almost same at Rs 150 crore.

ET Now: MRF numbers bring me to that tyre space because funds are actively buying into the tyre companies. We saw evidence of that yesterday with JK Tyre. The stocks are trading at fresh 52-week highs and they are continuing unabated. The Ceat QIP II on right now. what do you make of this space and particularly MRF as well with another quarter of very robust numbers? 
 
 
Dipan Mehta: In the last two-three years, the tyre companies have done exceedingly well. Certain amount of pricing discipline has come through and capacities have not come in place. At the same time, demand has increased pretty well and some of the export markets also have opened up for lot of these tyre companies and, of course, the final benefit was account of lower raw material cost especially rubber and all those benefits are flowing to the top line and the bottom line for most tyre companies. If you see in terms of performance, MRF had a bit of a laggard but after this result, one could clearly conclude that definitely the company has caught up with his peer group and maybe from this point on, it may even do better than its peer group considering its dominant position within the industry.
 
 
ET Now: Right but which is your top bet when it comes to the tyre space. MRF is an expensive stock but nevertheless it has had a strong run?
 
 
Dipan Mehta: Well some of the smaller tyre companies like TVS Srichakra and to an extent even Balkrishna Industries look quite interesting but Balkrishna came out with disappointing set of numbers. So we just like to hold our recommendation over there but TVS Srichakra continues to do exceedingly well and it is kind of a niche player. So that would be the preference but after these numbers of MRF, one would need to look at MRF more closely and understand exactly what went right for the company and that could also turn out to be a good investment opportunity.

Extremely bullish on MNC pharma space: Angel Broking,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/extremely-bullish-on-mnc-pharma-space-angel-broking/articleshow/16382327.cms,m.economictimes.com,Extremely bullish on MNC pharma space: Angel Broking,"In a chat with ET Now, Rajen Shah, Chief Investment Officer, Angel Broking, shares his views on pharma space. 

 
ET Now: On the charts Lupin? 

 Rajen Shah: I continue to be extremely bullish on the MNC pharma space. All pharma companies have moved up. Lupin, Wockhardt and a number of other midcap companies have also done very well. But I am a big fan of MNC pharma companies, so I believe that companies like Merck, Wyeth, Novartis, Pfizer are quoting at one-fifth or may be one-tenth of the market cap, what they are quoting in US, not even one-tenth, in fact, much lesser than what they quoting in US. 

 With India probably opening up more and more in future this all MNC companies will certainly try to expand their presence in India because so far they have been neglecting their subsidiaries. You see the market cap of Merck, Wyeth, Novartis and Pfizer, this is peanuts actually. Probably we could also see some delisting thing happening in case of MNC pharma companies. 

 So I feel that the opportunity in the pharma industry is huge so probably these parent companies may get more serious because they have been so far not taking that keen interest in their subsidiaries, so I am a big fan of MNC pharma at these levels.

MMTC climbs as board approves ICEX stake sale,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mmtc-climbs-as-board-approves-icex-stake-sale/articleshow/49054744.cms,m.economictimes.com,MMTC climbs as board approves ICEX stake sale,"NEW DELHI: Shares of MMTC shot up over 6 per cent in morning trade on Tuesday after the trading firm told the stock exchanges that it would sell a 10 per cent stake in the commodity bourse ICEX equally to two bidders, who participated in the recently concluded global tender.
 
 The state-run company has been looking for investors to offload its 26 per cent stake in the commodity bourse, Indian Commodity Exchange (ICEX), which wound up its operations towards the end of 2013. Currently, MMTC holds 5.20 crore equity shares in ICEX at a face value of Rs 5 each.
 
 ""The board of directors has ""approved the proposal for sale of 10 per cent of ICEX equity i.e. 5 per cent each, to two bidders who participated in the global tender against the present holding of 26 per cent in ICEX by MMTC at Rs 10 per share subject to the approval by the government and the Forward Markets Commission,"" the company said in a filing to BSE.
 
 ICEX does not have sufficient net worth and requires infusion of funds from existing shareholders as well as investment from fresh shareholders. However, MMTC is is not interested in infusing more funds to increase the net worth of the exchange to meet the regulatory norms, a PTI report said.
 
 MMTC had invited bids for purchase of a minimum 20 lakh shares (equivalent to 1 per cent shareholding in the bourse) at a minimum reserve price of Rs 10 a piece.
 
 The stock has lost 96 per cent of its market capitalisation in the past five years. The offer for sale (OFS) for 10 per cent of its stake in June 2013 was priced at a 72 per cent discount to the then prevailing stock price. Later in the year, FMC had issued a show-cause notice to ICEX, scrapping its registration because no business has been generated on the exchange since December 2013.
 
 During the end of 2013, the ICEX had decided to wind up operations and trading was accordingly suspended on December 24, 2013 after the business volumes got affected due to several factors including imposition of commodity transaction tax and the Rs 5,500 crore payment scam at NSEL.
 
 Other stakeholders in ICEX include Reliance Exchange Next with 26 per cent, IBFSL and Abhinay Trading Corporation's 14 per cent each, Indian Potash Ltd with 10 per cent, while KRIBHCO and IDFC hold five per cent each in the exchange.

Metal cos are having good volume growth',positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/metal-stocks-are-more-than-just-a-one-hit-wonder/articleshow/82516088.cms,m.economictimes.com,Metal stocks are more than just a one-hit wonder,"Let us not assume that the rally in metal stocks is a one-time story, it could be a compounding story as well, says Charandeep Singh, Founder & MD, Girik Capital in this interview. Also in conversation is Varun Daga, Co-founder & Fund Manager, Girik Capital. Edited excerpts:

How you are looking at the overall set up for the equity markets? The on-ground situation is adverse because of Covid and the FIIs are also continuously pulling out money.
Varun Daga: The market, as we always say, has a mind of its own and is now probably looking into the future. From the earnings side, we have had some good news as many sectors did well. So on the market front, things are looking alright. Markets are not willing to sell off that easily. The bull market looks robust. We have seen pockets of overvaluation at some places, but the overall market looks fine.

Before the second wave, we were doing so well across all sectors and this (Covid 2.0) was a setback. But hopefully, if things get back to normal on the economy side, the market is waiting for that issue to get sorted. Fundamentally, we do not see any big reason (for selloff). Domestic demand might get a little affected but there are a lot of opportunities on the exports side.


How will the inflation in raw material prices impact the FMCG sector, given its high valuation?

Charandeep Singh: There are headwinds in consumption-oriented sectors. There is no doubt that many of these companies are performers. But you have an earnings headwind over here because of commodity price inflation and the consumer slowdown in general. So it is possible that you may not get the desired outcome in terms of long-term IRR in this sector.


One often wonders as to how long is the metals rally going to last. Copper and other base metals are hitting fresh all-time highs. Do you feel that there is more upside left or would you say that the best is behind us?
Charandeep Singh: The last time you saw metals performing was in the rally from 2001 to 2008, and then a little bit at the beginning of this decade. It is very important for us to understand that the profit pools in a lot of these metal companies are cyclical. In the last decade, there were demand headwinds and many of these companies did not make good capital allocation decisions. The markets tend to react in an excessive manner, both pessimistically and optimistically, when it comes to cyclicals. 

But to paint all the companies in the sector with the same brush is not fair. This rally could also be because of restructuring in some of these metal companies in the last decade. They have cleaned up their balance sheets and divested non-core assets. This sector has got consolidated in a large way. In steel, for example, the top 4-5 steel producers in India produce bulk of the metal now. Through the NCLT procedure, a lot of valuable assets got gobbled up. 

The second thing you have is better asset allocation incrementally. Third thing, I would say, is that the best steel companies in India produce a decent return on capital and have a very secular demand scenario. So if you look at them over the last 25-30 years, they have done volume growth north of GDP and that is quite commendable. 

In the near-term, they are benefiting from a great pricing scenario globally. If you are selling 50% more metal, then you have a great chance of creating more operating leverage, especially if you are capital disciplined. 

Let us not assume this is a one-time thing or just a reset. It could be a compounding story as well. We should be open to that.


Is the rerating in speciality chemicals going to continue going forward? Are there opportunities or would you say that the best is in the price already?
Varun Daga: To a large extent, the multiple re-rating is probably done. But in terms of the opportunity size, it is huge. India is a hub for manufacturing and all these companies have become sizable ones now. They are generating enough capital on their own and do not really need to borrow money. So they can take up contracts from anywhere in the globe and produce at the cheapest cost. 

Having said that, they have run up a lot but all we have to focus is on growth and the size of opportunity. There are times when the market corrects and you get enough opportunities where some of these good businesses can be bought.


On pharma stocks
Varun Daga: I do not think the best is behind for pharma. It is a very typical sector because every company has its own fundamentals. There are different sectors within pharma - APIs, formulations, domestic and exports. You need to pick leaders in different areas. The story is still under play and they have better times ahead.

I know it is a truncated trading week but nevertheless it is a very big week for our markets. Are there more legs to this rally? Is the washout of a festive season and supply disruptions getting sorted out?If you see the market patterns, for almost six months now, there has been a very smart rotation at play wherein at different points of time, different sectors are performing. Some sectors are going through a bit of a lull and depending upon the triggers and the developments, certain other sectors are coming into limelight. 
 
Auto has been a performing sector for a while but in the two-wheeler space, the overall performance has not been that great because of the lack of demand. We are not seeing much of an excitement there but the Q2 numbers of most of the companies had indicated that the worst of the chip supply is behind them and gradually we will see the revival in terms of supply. Malaysian chipmakers starting to work at 100% capacity and smart chip issues receding came as a big positive surprise wherein there is a sense that growth will come back.
 
But one has to bear in mind is that the entire update on the improvement in chips is not going to benefit all the companies across. We feel that companies like Maruti and Motherson Sumi would be a bigger beneficiary of this development whereas the companies which are relying upon the European suppliers like JLR and some other global companies, may not benefit immediately. We like Maruti and Motherson Sumi as top picks both in the OEM and auto ancillary space. There is some more leg in terms of the upside for these two names.
 

Out of the three listed stocks and it will be four tomorrow, which is the one new tech stock you think should be part of everyone’s long-term portfolio where you may see a hit of 25% but it should be part of the core portfolio like a HDFC Bank in 2000 or Bajaj Finance in 2010?Even though IPO valuations have been on the higher side, we are seeing that post listing, the overall momentum and the activity around the IPOs have been exceptionally good. We are bringing in a lot of optimism in terms of what sort of growth these companies can throw up over the next three, five, seven years. 
 
Given the sort of dynamics that we are working with, we would really want to focus upon names where at least the basic product or the platform is showing a lot of promise in terms of traction and the management pedigree or the guys who are backing these companies are good. From that perspective, both Zomato and Nykaa are looking pretty promising in terms of what they have built so far. There is no point talking about valuations. It is all about what sort of growth in terms of top line or certain parameters that the market is looking at. We have to have a smaller allocation to these companies if we have to make them part of the portfolio. We have to see how over a period of time, they perform but these two names definitely are looking quite promising in terms of what they have built so far.
 

Which is your favourite unlock trade? Hotel, hospitality, travel, fashion?Retail like Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent are the names where we have seen very remarkable growth come back into the system. The sense we are getting is that the growth from here on is going to be much better. So definitely in terms of open up themes, we like these two names.
 
Apart from that, of course, Indian Hotels has been something that we have been liking a lot and given the fact that in the second half, the general occupancy levels are much better and this time around both in terms of business travel as well as the leisure travel we have seen a good traction. Travel is going to catch up big time over the next two quarters. 
 

In the pre Covid era, hotel stocks were not great wealth creators. Just because Covid has happened and they are making a comeback, some of those stocks are at a new high. Why should we go and buy hotel stocks because they still need capital and the return ratios are cyclical?A good insight. Our take is that you will see some sort of a consolidation play out in the last 12-15 months of this pandemic wherein smaller hotel units have shut down and the bigger guys have consolidated and a lot of cost controls have happened because of the way things have been for the hospitality sector. There are advantages of a much better positioning in the hospitality space, cost controls and the fact that the way things are going to shape up, the pricing environment and the occupancy levels are going to be much better.
 
The entire operating leverage could play out over the next 12-18 months and that would lead to some sort of a rerating of the larger players. I agree that it has not been one of the best performing sectors in terms of wealth creation, but from a technical positioning, given the way things have been, we think there is going to be a lot of excitement around the numbers that these companies are going to throw up and that could lead to some sort of a rerating.
 

We have also started seeing the API focus pharmaceutical stocks make a comeback. How are you approaching this entire sector now that the base effect of Covid will also no longer be at play?One thing which Covid and the entire sequence of events which happened in the last 12-15 months has taught us is that healthcare and diagnostics are going to be extremely critical from an overall lifestyle perspective. We all may get a little more cautious in terms of how to approach the healthcare and the kind of precautions that we need to take to see that we are a little better prepared to deal with any eventuality that would lead to much higher revenue for both healthcare companies as well as diagnostic companies.
 
We will see a big traction there. In terms of allocation, we think names like Apollo are going to be important because this is one stock which has done very well even with Covid and without Covid. The way they have expanded I think it is going to be a big beneficiary. Diagnostic is an area where one could see a lot of allocation because of the way things are. One should have a decent amount of allocation for these two sectors in the portfolio.
 

Why did you tweet about Ipca Labs today morning?Ipca numbers were not great and the stock has been a laggard for about two quarters. In healthcare and some of these companies where the overall growth is going to be slightly muted, the performance may not be that great. It is a good stock for somebody who wants to play the export and the API part but the overall growth triggers or the excitement factor would be missing in the near term.
 
 One should focus on Sun Pharma or Divi’s where the overall growth visibility is much better or even Gland Pharma where the stock has corrected from Rs 4,000 to Rs 3,500, but the growth visibility and the triggers are much better.

  By Gaurav Mehta
  
  The uncertainty around UP and other state elections has dominated investor attention of late -- so with the event outcome now imminent on this very day, the markets can be expected to be volatile, in the least. 
  
  However, from an overall trend perspective, both Nifty and Bank Nifty indices remain in an upward trend. Barring any exceptionally adverse outcome, we think that downsides, if any, should be limited and be used as buying opportunities. 
  
  The recent surge in Nifty implied volatility along with a significant addition in put positions clearly suggests that market participants have already taken ample protective measures. 
  
  It further indicates that there is low probability of sharp downside reactions. 
  
  We, thus, remain positive on Nifty, Bank Nifty in the medium term. From a stock-specific perspective we like Tata Motors and Voltas on the long side. 
  
  However, on the flip side we think FMCG stocks, especially Hindustan Unilever, look vulnerable to downside move. A break below 378 in the stock has the potential to shave off another 10% and, hence, should be used to create short positions.

  Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, in an interview with ET Now talks about the upcoming market trend.
  
  
  Stepping into the week because now we are going talk about earnings, what is it that you will be focussing on? 
  
  In general what we are going to see is growth coming in from most of the spaces, particularly you are going to see some of the heavyweights coming out with better numbers. We are going to see numbers coming good from Reliance side. 
  
  Also some of the banking stocks, private sector banks particularly where they did not have to do some provisioning kind of thing in the balance sheets. So they should be coming out with better numbers. IT companies we are expecting in general about between 15% and 20% growth reported in the bottom line. So auto companies for sure would definitely demand good amount of attention. 
  
  For a rally that they have seen in the volume, they should get reflected into the bottom line performance of this company. So overall, one can easily expect that the first quarter earning estimates would probably lead to somewhere around 25% growth in the financial year 2010-2011 and that should provide a much larger comfort to the investors to look at the Indian market. 
  
  Because if that being the situation and we are trading at around 16.5 times on a forward 9-month earning estimate basis for this financial year which would be sufficient enough for somebody to look at this market very positively. So I am reasonably confident that yes, overall, the macro aspects if they are coming under control in particular European economy related, my reading says that emerging markets like India would definitely demand better attention and we should be seeing further upside continuing in our market. 
  
  Though it would be very stock specific direction but it will be certainly there in our markets. So reasonably, we are remaining confident in that aspect.

Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/macros-suddenly-turning-supportive-for-markets-ajay-bodke/articleshow/38466461.cms,m.economictimes.com,Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,"In a chat with ET Now, Ajay Bodke, Head-Investment Strategist & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher, shares his views on the markets.
 
 
ET Now: Just when it appeared that Indian markets were looking slightly rusty, last 60 minutes yesterday made all the difference. What did the trick for us?
 
 
Ajay Bodke: What clearly is evident is that the macro variables are suddenly turning supportive for India. We saw some of the key data variables coming over the last few weeks. Be it the IIP number for May at 4.7 per cent where after nearly 15 quarters, the consumer durable numbers have done positive at 3.2 per cent. Followed by a four-month low WPI number that came in last week and a CPI number which presently surprised the market at 7.3 per cent which is the lowest since the new series has been started being computed from January 2012. So these are the issues that have been taken positively by the market.
 
 Also globally the crude prices, coal prices, iron and steel prices are clearly showing to be under control. Let us not forget that 75 per cent of India’s trade deficit is the oil and 12 per cent of India’s trade deficit is coal. So you are essentially looking at a substantial chunk of a trade deficit and the commodities contributing them on a downward trend. That is bringing cheer back to the market in addition to the budget which in view of the very tight fiscal space available to the Finance Minister has presented an admirable budget.
 
 Especially with drought looming in the wheat bowl as well as central parts of India as well as only 7 regions out of 36 sub-metro divisions getting excess rainfall and the rest of either having scanty or deficit rainfall. So we have to keep a very close watch on a weekly basis about the sowing data and on the progress of the monsoons. But overall, we are in my opinion over the hump and the market should consolidate at the current level.

ET Now: What are your closing comments? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: For me, this is a market which remains in an uptrend but now very close to important supply points. Typically, a good way to trade this kind of situation would be to tighten your stop losses. In case, the market fails to give a breakout, we might see it get back into this broad 180-200 point range with the 6180-6160 as support and 6320-6350 as the upper end of the range.
 
 In case there is a good breakout happening, then we might want to look at higher levels and if the Nifty manages to get pass 6350-6360 on a closing basis, good chance that we will head towards 6480-6500 sometime during the March expiry. So the bias is positive but given the fact that we are very close to historical levels, tactically we are trading with shorter stop losses. Individual stock I am still positive, the Nifty midcap index has given a strong buy signal and maybe the breadth might do better than the broader index.

	Reliance Industries:  Recent correction from the top of Rs 1040 resulted in the formation of double bottom around Rs 920 levels from the cushion of which this scrip rallied. Hence one can buy for immediate target of Rs 990 with a stop below Rs 936 on closing basis.

Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/long-term-bonds-appear-to-be-the-magic-wand/articleshow/38833689.cms,m.economictimes.com,Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan last week performed a sex reassignment surgery on the Indian banking sector. He permitted banks to raise funds selling long-term bonds to build infrastructure. The logic was that building infrastructure is time-consuming, so it needed to be funded by long-term funds instead of short-term deposits, the mainstay of banks.


	Just a few months ago, RBI bought the argument of IDFC, an institution created exclusively to fund infrastructure projects, that its survival will be under threat if it keeps borrowing long-term through bonds. It granted a licence to IDFC to turn itself into a bank so that it can take deposits. The logic was it makes eminent sense to take deposits and lend rather than through bonds for 10 years. That could be done only if IDFC changes its gender, the wish that Rajan granted.


	How is it that in a matter of few months the regulator buys two different arguments, and grants opposite wishes? Is the regulator framing policies for industry, or individual cases determine what the policy is?


	The irony is that this is not the first time that the Indian financial sector is undergoing gender reassignment, but the second time in less than two decades. In the 1990s, development financial institutions led by ICICI converted into banks with a ‘convert or perish’ campaign espoused by its then chief K V Kamath. ICICI Bank succeeded, IDBI Bank managed to remain afloat following it. But the one that chose to retain the financial institution character, IFCI, is nearly irrelevant.


	If borrowing long term and lending was a wrong business model then for ICICI and now for IDFC, how is it that it’s good for banks? Are we making the entire banking system into development financial institutions?


	It was not the dearth of funds, but the composition of funding and lending that landed the Indian banking industry in a soup. Years of lending short-term bank funds to long-term projects, throwing the basics of asset-liability management to the winds, made banks shaky. When the interest rate cycle turned higher and the economy slowed, all the sins of the bull market came back to haunt. There is nothing to show that it will be different in the next cycle.


	Keeping in mind the ICICI and IDFC experience, it would have been wiser to ask: why did banks lend long-term instead of permitting them to sell long-term bonds? It also doesn't help in the efficient development of bond markets. Why should banks compete with its own customers in the same market for funds?


	 

	If banks are smart, they should not sell bonds, or stop just with token bond issues. If they go all out as if there is no tomorrow, they may well be sowing the seeds of the next banking crisis. The current one is because their funds are short term and lending is long term. The next one will be the flip side of it – longer term funds and short-term assets.


	There is near-unanimity that Indian interest rate cycle is at its peak now, and the only direction for rates is to head south. It is the outcome for which Rajan is working so hard. So, goading banks to borrow long term at current interest rates is something similar to what US Federal Reserve former chairman Alan Greenspan did to mortgage borrowers. Greenspan advised individual borrowers to shift to floating rates. That turned out to be the worst financial advice that anyone could give. It left millions homeless.


	Given the Indian financial tradition and the smartness of borrowers, the dice will be loaded against banks in the case of long-term bonds.


	At current interest rates, banks may be borrowing at near 10% without a call or put option. But they may be lending to someone who may have the choice of refinancing the loan at a lower rate when interest rates ease. Not many borrowers will accept covenants that prevent such a switch. So, the liability of banks will be for longer term, and assets could be of a shorter duration.


	Apart from Indian banking coming a full circle, it also raises the question of which is the right model. The truth is there is no formula for good profits all the time. It’s the quest for profitability that drives managements to compromise on prudence and overdo anything that delivers profits.


	This is the beginning of the next boom for the Indian economy. For the banking industry, long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand that will bring them out of the current mess and set them on the path to eternal profitability.


	What may begin as a trickle may quickly gather pace. The test will be how many guard against getting carried away. If there are excesses, then the system may end up being a eunuch once again looking for a gender change.

The stock has gained 9% in the past one month against a flat Sensex. The stock made its 52-week high of Rs 275 on January 4. KKCL’s performance on bourses has been outstanding. For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 37%, and it has doubled in six months. The stock gave an annual return of 113% beating the Sensex as well the ET Retail Index that rose 86% and 80% during the period, respectively. KKCL, which clocked revenues of Rs 159.4 crore in the past four quarters, manufactures jeans, semi-formals and casual wear under the brands Killer, Integriti, Lawman and Easies. Killer is the flagship brand that commands the highest margin for KKCL. Around 3-4% of KKCL’s sales are from exports to Asia, Middle East and the US. The company has doubled its net profit in the first half of FY10 against that reported in the same period a year ago. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters and will continue to do so in the future due to economies of scale on account of increased production capacity. Besides volume, average realisation has also gone up. The company sells products on a consignment basis, thus transferring the risk to its franchisee. \This asset-light strategy, coupled with integration and low-working capital requirements enables the company to enjoy higher returns on equity and on capital employed. In FY09, the company cleared a lot of its pending stock and has maintained low inventory levels since then, which will help in maintaining margins. The company reported net sales of Rs 57 crore in the September 2009 quarter, up 19% from the corresponding period a year ago. Operating profit at Rs 16.3 crore and a net profit at 11.5 crore were the highest since the time the company got listed in 2006. It has improved its debt to equity ratio from 0.17x on March 2009 to 0.10x as on September 2009. It also has surplus cash of Rs 105 crore, which leaves enough scope for further expansion. At Rs 267 and an annualised EPS of Rs 28.8 for FY10, the stock is valued at 9.3x its earnings, which makes it a good buy at this point of time. Going ahead, it could be a good turnaround stock for one’s portfolio. "

Maintain overweight stance on IT sector: Gautam Chhaochharia,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/maintain-overweight-stance-on-it-sector-gautam-chhaochharia/articleshow/32776348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Maintain overweight stance on IT sector: Gautam Chhaochharia,"In a chat with ET Now, Gautam Chhaochharia, Head-India Research, UBS, shares his views on the rupee and it will affect the IT sector. 

 
ET Now: Do you think the rupee adjustment in large cap IT stocks is not fully captured or could IT stocks see some more downside given the way how the rupee has appreciated? 

 
Gautam Chhaochharia: We still maintain our overweight stance on IT services sectors. What we have seen till now is more of a sector rotation rather than reflecting the rupee appreciation and on the other hand we would also like to point out or argue that the levels of rupee at 62-63 was not really factored into most of the street earnings estimates because it was just for a short period of time. 

 So in that context, I do not think the rupee will move either from Rs 60 to Rs 63 levels or the move back has played a big role. It has been more a sector rotation trade which has happened specifically given EM flows globally. So investors have been forced to do more sector rotation rather than add significant positions on India. 

 The second point to highlight from our perspective, where we still maintain our overweight position on IT, is that for us IT is not just about a currency play. So that is one small short-term tactical issue, but the two bigger drivers for was, one, this recovery being seen in the US and Europe, which continues. 

 Secondly, the building blocks for more medium-term growth visibility for this sector is now emerging in the form of infrastructure and BPO sectors which have achieved scale and which can provide growth visibility not just for next one-two years, but for the longer term which is critical for valuations to sustain or even rerate from the current levels.

Infosys: Will it surprise markets once again?,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/infosys-will-it-surprise-markets-once-again/articleshow/19474462.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys: Will it surprise markets once again?,"MUMBAI: Analysts on average expect Infosys to report a topline growth of 3% for the March 2013 quarter helped by the revenue from recently acquired Lodestone.
 
 Operating margin will be under pressure due to onsite wage hikes and a limited support from the currency movements. In addition, the revenue guidance for FY14 will likely be far more optimistic than the prior year considering the momentum in winning new accounts, believe analysts.
 
 Infosys, the second largest IT exporter among those listed on Indian bourses will declare its quarterly and annual financial performance on Friday, April 12, 2013.
 
 According to the average estimates of the forecasts by eight brokerages and estimates of ET Intelligence Group, Infosys is expected to report 3% increase in revenue in the March 2013 quarter from the previous quarter. Net profit, however, will fall by 3% sequentially reflecting analysts’ expectation of pressure on profitability.
 
 The consolidation of Lodestone’s business is likely to add 1-2% in the dollar terms to Infosys’s topline for the quarter, which means the core business growth will likely be muted at around 2% compared with the previous quarter’s 6% sequential jump. Volume growth is expected to be over 1.5%, lower than 2% in the previous quarter.
 
 The company increased onsite salaries by 2-3%, which will impact the operating profitability marginally for the March quarter.
 
 Investors will await to see whether the company continues to provide annual performance guidance given rising uncertainty in the global demand scenario. Analysts expect 9-12% revenue growth guidance from Infosys for FY14. This is higher than the anticipated 6% increase in the FY13 revenue.

The market reacted positively to the news and the counter gained 6.68% on Friday, in a day when the Sensex tanked by 1.28%.
 
 Other companies from the IT sector are also expected to extend the growth momentum seen in the first quarter of the current financial year on the back of improving visibility in the US markets and higher off-shoring from Europe. This is a seasonally strong quarter for the IT sector. Infosys’ topline growth would have been higher if there was no depreciation in the global currencies, such as the British pound, euro and yen, against the US dollar.
 
 Among the large players, TCS is expected to report the highest topline and bottomline growth among its Indian peers, following the merger with its Japanese entity. Around $100 million will come from the merger of Mitsubishi Corp’s ITF. Margin pressure may be experienced by HCL Tech and Wipro because of the recent wage hikes

 The bank said net profit rose to Rs 421.06 crore from Rs 334.84 crore in the year-ago quarter. Core fee income rose 38% to Rs 487 crore. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and paid out, rose 18% to Rs 801 crore.
 
 Shares of IndusInd Bank fell after the results were announced. The stock lost 1.65% to close at Rs 543.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on a day when the exchange’s benchmark index, the Sensex, slipped 0.54%.
 
 “We have grown our net profit powered by core fee income, which was also up 10% quarter-on-quarter,” said Romesh Sobti, MD and CEO at IndusInd Bank. “There has been rock-stable quality of our loan book.”
 
 The bank expanded its loans by 24% y-o-y to Rs 58,664 crore. Corporate loans rose 38% to Rs 33,300 crore, while retail or consumer finance loans were up just 9% at 25,364 crore.
 
 The ratio of corporate to retail loans stood at 57:43 compared with 51:49 a year ago. The bank said it plans to expand retail lending in the current fiscal as it sees good demand for vehicle financing in the coming quarters on the back of economic optimism.
 
 “In commercial vehicle segment, there is definitely demand picking up. Mining bans are being lifted in some states,” Sobti said, adding that all vehicle loans will have good demand. Demand for two-wheeler loans was significantly higher in the vehicle loans segment.
 
 The lender’s net bad loans or non-performing asset ratio stood at 0.33% versus 0.21% in the year-ago quarter.
 
 The bank has provided Rs 20 crore for corporate clients having un-hedged exposures as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India a few months ago. However, the bank has provided double the amount it actually required.
 
 According to Sobti, the profit level would have been higher without this provision. There could be a possibility of write-back of this provision if all banks decide to pass on the cost to their borrowing companies.
 
 “I certainly feel, achhe din aane wale hein (good days are set to come). A lot of political capital has been created due to the mandate (given to the new government). Markets are up. It means some stressed companies can access market for raising capital,” he said.

Indian companies’ return on equity (RoE) — a measure of a firm’s efficiency at maximising profits for shareholders — which in 2013-14 hit the lowest level in a decade, is expected to pick up in the current financial year driven by possible decline in interest rates, margin recovery and improved asset turnover ratio, said HSBC.  	RoE is expected to increase from 15% in 2013-14 to 16.5% by 2015-16. Indian companies’ RoE hit a peak of 22% in 2005. Although RoE has fallen in all major markets over the past few years on weaker global growth, RoE contraction in India has been among the most severe.  	“Although we do not expect RoE to return to the highs of 2005-08 anytime soon, we believe it has bottomed and expect profitability to improve,” said Jitendra Sriram, equity strategist and head of research, HSBC in a note. “We forecast RoE to rise 150 bps by FY16 and 200 bps by FY17 from the current level of 15%,” he said.  	HSBC expects materials and industrials to contribute significantly to the expected increase in India’s overall RoE  	HSBC said companies’ ROE compression was triggered by factors such as the decline in corporate profitability, increases in interest rates and a rising component of overseas revenues. The cost of doing business in India has gone up sharply due to factors such as an increase in the cost of inputs, difficulty in acquiring land and tougher environmental regulation, said the note.  	RBI hiked rates 13 times between March 2010 and October 2011 as it attempted to curb inflationary pressures. HSBC research shows the main drag on India’s overall RoE has clearly come from domestic cyclical sectors. The industrial sector’s RoE plunged from 34% in March 2005 to an all-time low of 11% in the last fiscal year ending March 2014. "

 Its glass-packaging business is also set for a turnaround, which would lead to non-linear earnings growth in the next two years. “We will grow at least 20% for the next two years in the bathroom products business. We are the price setters and we have been consistently outpacing the industry,” Sandip Somany, managing director of HSIL, told ET. “In our glass business, the losses are declining and we expect the business to become profitable at operating levels in the first half of 2014-15.”
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Though HSIL’s stock has gained 30% in the past month, it still continues to be under-valued if the two businesses — sanitary ware and glass — are to be valued independently. In the first nine months of the current fiscal, the operating profit (EBIT) of HSIL’s bathroom products grew 24%. Its profit after tax for the trailing 12 months is around Rs110 crore.
 
 Its peers — Cera and Kajaria — are trading at earnings multiples of 24 and 22, respectively. Giving HSIL a conservative multiple of 20, its building product business should be valued at Rs2,000 crore. But the company’s market capitalisation is only Rs830 crore. This is despite the company’s strong growth and margins compared with its peers. (see table) The reason for this is the glasspackaging business, which after being a drag for the last two years, is now on the road to recovery. HSIL has increased prices of the glass container business after almost two years.
 
 After growing at 27% CAGR from FY08-FY12, HSIL’s glass business started slowing down due to over capacity in the industry and the overall slowdown, especially consumption of beverages, beer and liquor. But the consumption is likely to pick up. Liquor and beer companies make up 60% of the business’ clients. Stocks of companies such as United Spirits and United Breweries are some of the most expensive stocks listed (P/E of more than 100) as the Street expects the consumption to pick up. HSIL offers a good proxy play at much lower valuations.
 
 “Industry discipline in terms of few furnace shutdowns seen last year should help improve demand-supply fundamentals. Various cost-control measures should yield operating leverage for HSIL as growth revives,” said Saurabh Kumar, analysts with JP Morgan in a recent report. With its strong presence in the high-growth sanitary business and potential turnaround in the glass business, the stock is due for a re-rating. In the past, consumer discretionary companies such as TTK Prestige, Asian Paints and Hawkins that enjoyed similar market positions in their respective industries, have become multi-baggers.

It is also used with readymix concrete to reduce usage of cement in construction. Bain Capital Private Equity had large chemicals businesses in its portfolio in the past, including firms such as Rhodia, paints maker SigmaKalon and Germany’s Trespaphan.Bain Capital private equity India head Amit Chandra could be nominated on the board of Himadri, although a final decision on the issue would be made after the completion of the open offer, which would likely raise Bain’s shareholding to a maximum of 35%, said a person connected with the development. According to Anurag Choudhary, Bain’s association is also to enable his company go global. “We had bid for Germany’s Rutgers in 2007, but withdrew due to high valuations. Now we might revisit our global plans,” he added.The company plans to set up a plant in China’s Shandong province in partnership with a local firm. The Choudharys will own 97% in that Chinese venture. “We want to have a total capacity of 1 mt in 3 years that will make us the top three producer globally,” he added. The focus of the PE deal with Himani, one of the few initiated in 2009, is also the emphasis on domain expertise, a pre-condition that most limited partners in PE funds have been insisting on after valuations plunged post the liquidity crisis. Large investors in a PE firm are referred to as limited partners. They provide capital to be invested in selected assets for returns after, typically, three to five years.A recent survey of major PE limited partners by KPMG, found many of them sought stronger operating skills as the downturn progressed into 2009 and as the falling tide exposed the internal problems of portfolio firms. “As LPs will make clear through their choice of fund managers, it is this factor more than any other that will likely separate the successful PE firm from its peers over the next few years,” said the survey."

HDFC third quarter net rises 12%,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/hdfc-third-quarter-net-rises-12/articleshow/29225501.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,HDFC third quarter net rises 12%,"MUMBAI: Housing Finance Development Corp on Wednesday met expectations with a 12 per cent increase in the third-quarter net profit, as demand for loans from individual home buyers remained healthy despite a slowdown in the economy. Net profit for the October-December period rose to Rs 1,278 crore from Rs 1,140 crore a year earlier, the country’s oldest mortgage lender said.
 
 Net interest margin, or the difference between funding costs and interest earned on loans, was nearly flat at 4 per cent compared with 4.06 per cent a year earlier. Net interest income, which is comparable with revenue for companies in other sectors, rose nearly 16 per cent to Rs 1,829 crore.
 
 While demand for funds has slowed in a weak economy, the housing finance sector has remained somewhat insulated. Individual home buyers, who are driving this demand, have also been repaying their loans regularly, helping lenders offset slippages in other loan categories.
 
 For instance, at HDFC, bad loans in the retail portfolio fell to 0.57 per cent in the December quarter from 0.62 per cent a year earlier. This helped limit its overall non-performing assets – which rose to 0.77 per cent of total loans from 0.75 per cent – despite NPA in the non-individual segment almost doubling to 1.81 per cent.
 
 Vice-chairman Keki Mistry said the lender will focus more on growing its individual loan book. “We expect the loan book to grow in the range of 18-20 per cent,” he said. Mistry predicted its cost of funds to remain flat because “ interest rates are expected to remain stable”.
 
 HDFC’s total outstanding loans grew 19.5 per cent to more thanRs 1.92 lakh crore at the end of December. “Most of the housing finance companies, including HDFC and LIC Housing Finance, have seen growth in loan portfolio,” said Kajal Gandhi, a banking analyst at ICICI Securities.
 
 
 
“We have a positive outlook on the sector.” But competition is intensifying, with banks aggressively targeting the home buyer at a time when demand for funds from other segments of the economy is low. “HDFC has managed to maintain its net interest margin because of its sheer size and good liability management,” said Gandhi.
 
 Rikesh Parikh, vice-president of institutional corporate broking at Motilal Oswal Securities, said HDFC’s plan to focus on smaller cities to boost growth in a slowing economy is a positive sign.
 
 According to him, HDFC’s asset quality has remained healthy over the past several quarters and the trend is likely to continue. The lender’s capital adequacy ratio for the quarter ended December was 19.1 per cent compared with 17.5 per cent a year earlier.

  PUNE: Groundnut oil prices have surged 35% as nut production declined by 25% in 2009-10 due to less rains.
  
  ”The historically highest ever price of Rs 96/kg of groundnut oil was recorded on September 13 in Rajkot market. The prices have come down during the last few days as a new crop is likely to arrive in the market Dusserra onwards,” said GG Patel, an oil broker in Rajkot. The wholesale price of groundnut oil in Rajkot on September 30 was Rs 83/kg. 
  
  Cargill’s Gemini brand refined groundnut oil has an MRP of Rs 135/kg in Pune. However, sources in Cargill said the oil is expected to be sold at Rs 105-110/kg. 
  
  Cargill India spokesperson said, “There is pressure on the supply side as it is the end of the season. The prices will start easing when the new season will begin from October end.”
  
  Groundnut oil, considered a premium variety, accounts for 7-8% of the total edible oil consumption of the country. Gujarat accounts for 40% groundnut production. The rest is produced by Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 
  
  “As groundnut kernels are increasingly being used for direct human consumption, lesser amounts are becoming available for oil extraction,” said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association of India. 
  
  The area under groundnut in 2010-11 has increased by five lakh hectares to 49.44 lakh hectare from 44.24 lakh hectare in the previous year. 
  
  The production of groundnut oil is expected to increase from 15 lakh tonne to 16 lakh tonne in 2009-10 to 20 lakh tonnes in 2010-11. The area under the crop remains constant in Gujarat and Maharashtra while it has gone up in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/four-wheelers-propel-growth-for-greaves-cotton/articleshow/32816242.cms,m.economictimes.com,Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,"For Greaves Cotton, sliding sales volumes of three-wheelers since the quarter to March FY12 was a major worry, since it was a major supplier of engines to three-wheelers. Three-wheeler sales volumes were severely impacted as freight operators moved to lower horse power, or HP, four-wheeler vehicles such as Tata Motors Ace and M&M Gio, which are classified as small commercial vehicles, or SCVs. 

 The Greaves Cotton management then decided to shift focus from the three-wheeler companies to the SCV segment, hoping this would deliver revenue growth higher than its core business catering to three-wheelers. Through the “hub & spoke” model, which involves transporting goods through highways by heavy vehicles and then using small vehicles for city roads, the company supplied SCV engines to Tata Motors for Ace Zip and the Magic Iris model. 

 The company’s SCV engine volumes now account for 14 per cent of its total engine volumes, compared with a negligible contribution three years ago. Says Sunil Pahilajani, MD & CEO, Greaves Cotton, “Our focus has changed to auto original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) side, from being a threewheeler supplier to a complete solution provider to the SCV segment. In trying times, our focus has been on adding to the product range, adding more customers and to enter various categories.” 

 After Pahilajani took charge of the company two years ago, he ensured there was a CEO for each segment and spun off the after-sales segment as a separate division. Revenue from the after-sales segment now accounts for 15% of the company’s total revenue and it enjoys a high margin compared to the other segments. Given the economic slowdown, which impacted volumes of power gensets and the industrial engines segment, the company targeted augmenting revenues from the after-sales segment and to increase its exports. 

 “We are able to maintain revenue growth from the after-sales segment, when industry players have seen a significant dip in revenues from this vertical. Revenue from after-sales has partially offset pressures emanating from other verticals,” said Pahilajani. He said the company is planning to increase revenue contribution from the export market to 10% in the next three years from 3% now. The company’s plant now works at 70 per cent capacity utilisation. 

 In the next few quarters, Greaves Cotton’s farm equipment segment is expected to do well and its contribution to the company’s total revenues is expected to rise as the company is making inroads into the electric pump-set market, which has a market size of.`3,000 crore. Besides, the company has a 50% market share in the petrol and kerosene market and has 1,000 retail touch points in India. It also plans to grab market share in the highly fragmented electric pump market. 

 But what could be a big threat to the company in the next few quarters is the possibility of revenue growth being affected if auto companies start manufacturing engines themselves. Besides, a heavy monsoon, drought or floods can also impact its revenue growth. More importantly, the company’s revenue growth is linked to the revival of the road sector, which has been struggling owing to a fall in traffic, high interest rates and policy paralysis. 

 According to Bloomberg data, the company’s revenues and profits are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% and 23 per cent, respectively, in the FY09-15 period. Greaves Cotton has attracted considerable interest from domestic mutual funds, based on its high earnings potential in the coming years. Fund houses such as Reliance and IDFC hold 8 per cent and 5 per cent stake, respectively, in the company.

Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/greaves-cotton-set-to-flourish-with-improving-margins/articleshow/48721599.cms,m.economictimes.com,Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,"Greaves Cotton saw a 10% fall in revenue year on year (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2015-16. The exit from the infrastructure equipment business is the main reason behind this fall in revenue. Delayed recovery in four-wheeler small commercial vehicle segment and a sluggish growth in farm equipment segment, due to slow release of subsidies and small increase in minimum support price, have also contributed to this revenue contraction. But, despite the fall in revenue, the company has impressed the market because of a robust growth in profit.
 
 
Improvement in margins helped the company report an adjusted net profit growth of 22% y-o-y. The reported net profit growth is up 51% y-o-y. The net profit this time also contains a one-time profit related to the sale of properties. The 527 basis points margin improvement, y-o-y, in the first quarter, is largely attributable to Cotton Greaves’s exit from the infrastructure equipment business, which was making continuous losses at the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level. Improved operational efficiencies, such as reduction in material and employee costs, further contributed to better margins.
 
 Though Greaves Cotton is into the manufacturing of engines that work on almost all fossil fuels—petrol, diesel, kerosene—and can used in automobiles—threewheelers, four-wheeler small commercial vehicles—fishing boats, agri pumps, etc., most of its revenue comes from the automobile segment. Greaves Cotton, with a market share of 85%, is the biggest player in the three-wheeler auto segment.
 
 To augment its auto engine business further, the company has developed engines that can be fitted on vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tonne, a major jump from the previous level of 0.8 tonne. The company should see a significant improvement in its four-wheeler engine market share, currently at 14%, in the coming years. In July, the company signed a deal with Eicher-Polaris for its 600 cc four-wheeler vehicle, Multix, and is trying to get one more four-wheeler company on board during this financial year. Besides new tie-ups, a ramp up in volumes from existing partners is also possible, given the increase in the company’s engine offerings.
 
 
The future looks extremely bright for Greaves Cotton and as per the consensus analysts’ estimate, its net profit is expected to zoom to Rs 211 crore in 2016-17, an annualised 59% gain compared to 2014-15. This fast-growing company’s stock is quoting at reasonable valuations and, therefore, investors can buy it for long-term investment.

Though jewellery sales gathered momentum, the metal lost its lustre among investors as a lucrative instrument to park funds. Bullion dealers said there has been panic selling as news spread that gold has entered a bearish mode. 

 Rajiv Popley, director of Mumbai-based Popley & Sons, said: “Demand has surged at least by 15-20% in the past two days. Buyers are placing orders for Akshay Tritiya which is on May 13. We also had a good Gudi Padwa, which marks the beginning of the new year according to the Hindu calendar.” 

 What is enthusing the jewellers is that consumers are buying jewellery for own use and not for weddings and festivals. “This is a good sign for jewellers. We are seeing that demand has drifted from diamond-studded jewellery to pure gold jewellery. The ratio of gold jewelley to gold investment products is now 65:35. But at this level investment demand is likely to fall by 50%,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director, Nemichand Bamalwa, and past chairman of All India Gem and Jewellery Trade Federation. 

 In 2012, jewellery demand in India slipped to 552 tonne from 618.3 tonne in 2011 largely due to rising prices. 

 The import price rose because the rupee weakened against the dollar, pushing up the landed cost of the metal. Investment demand in 2012 was at 312.2 tonne, which slipped from 368 tonne in 2011, according to World Gold Council data. 

 Bullion dealers say jewellers are not entering the market though the price has fallen as they would like to liquidate the inventories first. “There is hardly any buying from jewellers as there is a feeling that prices will come down to Rs 24,200 per 10 gm. Silver is expected to fall to Rs 39,000 per 1 kg,” said Suresh Hundia, director, Hundia Exports, a leading Mumbai -based bullion dealer. 

 In Bangalore, demand for jewellery has surged by 30% in the past two days. Venkatesh Babu, owner of Bangalore-based Chetna Jewellers & Bullion, said: “Footfall has increased and consumers are buying gold for their own use. However, investors are staying away at the moment and they are waiting for the price to stabilise.” 

 Analysts say gold may bounce back to Rs 26, 000 in the near term. Kishore Narne, associate director & head, Commodity & Currency, Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker, said the plunge in gold prices seems to be ending as it has broken all near-term supports and had a free fall over the last two trading sessions. 

 “The next big support for gold exists at $1,310 and we expect that support to hold for the near term,” he said.“A pullback towards $1,400 an ounce looks possible and holding above that can extend it towards $1,440. The crash in gold prices is close to the near term bottom and will start to see pullback and consolidation. 

 Gold will take support between Rs 25,200-25,100 and can bounce from there towards Rs 25,800-26,000. Sustaining below Rs 25,000 can push the prices towards Rs 24,500-24,200 in the coming days. 

 Silver has given up all gains over the last 2 years and will continue to trade weak. Pullbacks look due and can extend towards Rs 45,000-45,500 per kg,” he added.

The global economic crisis and the resultant volatility have led to the need for diversification of portfolios and increased the importance of risk management. It’s during such times that gold’s fundamental characteristics stand out as a hedge against inflation and preserver of wealth.

Besides, there is a continued erosion of purchasing power of the world’s key currencies, rising inflation and, of late, the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. Little wonder then that the metal has risen since 2002.

According to the World Gold Council's (WGC) latest report, the global demand in the second quarter of 2012-13 stood at 990 tonne, down 7% on a year-on-year basis due to the weak demand in jewellery, investment and technology. The net buying trend by banks, which started in the second quarter of 2009, continued in this quarter as well. The demand by central banks and official institutions in the developing countries increased 63% to 157.5 tonne. Gold's cultural heartland, India and China, continued to dominate the consumer demand segment, contributing 45% to the total jewellery, bar and coin demand.

The consumer demand for gold in China for the second quarter of 2012 was 145 tonne, down 7% y-o-y due to the economic slowdown and lack of a clear price trend. In the first quarter of 2012, the demand rose to a record 255.2 tonne, overtaking that of India. In India, the monetary tightening, rapid depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, economic slowdown, stubborn inflation, high interest rates and fear of weak monsoons curtailed the gold demand as prices touched a record high of Rs 31,422 per 10 gm.

The upward trend has continued since 2000 and gold has performed well compared with other asset classes, with a CAGR of 17% from 2000 through 2011 and a notable 22% during 2010 and 2011. Gold has posted a 13% year-to-date return, whereas the Sensex yielded 12% during this period.

India's gold imports rose to 969 tonne, amounting to $60 billion in 2011-12, pushing the current account deficit to a record $78.2 billion, 4.2% of the GDP, due to the rupee depreciation. This prompted the government to hike import duty on gold to 4% of the value in March 2012. Since then, gold imports have declined 37% to 131 tonne during April-June 2012, according to the WGC report. The consumer demand stood at 181.3 tonne for the second quarter of 2012, down 38% on a y-o-y basis. However, the assets under management of the 14 gold ETFs in India touched Rs 10,300 crore in May 2012, from Rs 5,463 crore a year ago. However, according to GFMS, the imports to India may fall 26% to 650-750 tonne in 2012.


				


Gold prices inched to an all-time high at just above $1,920 per ounce in September 2011 amid concerns about western economies. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has strengthened, adversely impacting the prices in global markets.

	 

doweshowbellyad = 0;

The yellow metal touched a low of $1,538 per ounce in May 2012 due to the sovereign debt crisis in the Euro-zone, and is currently trading at $1,690 per ounce. The prices have moved in a range with slight ups and downs. Presently, gold prices are tracking the global sentiment and moving in tandem with the riskier assets.


				


In August this year, after the US Federal Reserve Annual Symposium, and comments from the Fed chairman about the continuation of accommodative polices in the US, the metal surged to a five-month high of $1,693 per ounce.


				


The global demand is expected to strengthen in the future, triggered by the hope of monetary easing in the US, and positive outcome of the European Central Bank meeting on 6 September, which announced an unlimited bond buying program to fix Eurozone countries' borrowing costs. It could weaken the US dollar, increasing the investment in gold. On the domestic front, the demand will depend on the rupee depreciation and policy measures. The rain deficiency is likely to fall, driving gold demand in rural areas. It may also gain strength due to the festive/wedding season during October-December.

 The Mumbai-headquartered company had posted a net profit of Rs 208.58 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.
 
 The company, however, said its net profit for the quarter is not comparable due to out-licensing income of Rs 111.23 crore received in the corresponding quarter last year and also due to mark-to-market losses to the extent of Rs 55 crore recorded in the first quarter of 2012-13 fiscal, PTI reported.
 
 “However, the core net profit (excluding the out-licencing income and the forex loss/gain) jumped by 44.3 per cent YoY to Rs129.6 crore,” Sharekhan said in a report.
 
 At 01:14 pm, Glenmark Pharma was trading 5 per cent higher at Rs 406.95. It has hit a low of Rs 381.50 and a high of Rs 409.80 today.
 
 Rajat Rajgarhia, Director-Research, Motilal Oswal Securities, bets on Ipca Laboratories Ltd, Torrent Pharma and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd in the pharma sector, among his multi-bagger ideas.
 
 Both revenue and sales of the pharma major surged during the quarter. During the quarter, the company’s sales from the Indian formulation business stood at Rs 279.78 crore, up 24 per cent, as against Rs 225.38 crore registered in the first quarter of the 2011-12 fiscal.
 
 In Q1FY2013 the net sales of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Glenmark) grew by 19.8 per cent year on year (YoY) to Rs 1,040.4 crore.
 
 “The specialty business includes the Indian formulation business, which grew by 24.1 per cent YoY during the quarter. Though the growth rate is better than the industry growth rate of 15%, it falls short of our expectation,” Sharekhan reported.
 
 The brokerage firm maintains a ‘buy’ recommendation on the counter with a target price of Rs 468 for a 12-month timeframe.
 
 The company posted revenues of Rs 392.35 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2012, mainly driven by generic business. The revenues stood at Rs 251.15 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal.
 
 Avinnash Gorakssakar, Founder Director, Moneyinvestments.in is positive on the pharma sector. Cipla and Glenmark Pharma are among his top bets.
 
 Although for Glenmark the price has moved up a bit, but with the kind of decline in their upfront payment, one can definitely buy the stock for long-term, he added.
 
 Gaurang Shah, Assistant Vice President, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd, recommends investors to ‘buy’ Glenmark Pharma with a target price of Rs 445.

 The GSK Consumer team has shortlisted one location each in Nellore and Chittoor for the plant, which will produce Horlicks and Boost branded products with an investment of up to Rs 1,000 crore, ET said in a report quoting a senior bureaucrat. 

 The company is waiting for clarity on tax incentives before taking a decision. Rival Mondelez India Foods Ltd, formerly known as Cadbury India, has said it is setting up its largest facility in the continent at the Sri City special economic zone Chittoor district, investing about Rs 1,000 crore. 

 As per the ET report, GSK is scouting for about 100 acres of land at the two locations, apart from connectivity to the natural gas grid, and has conveyed plans to produce Foodles, which is its instant noodles product, biscuits and oats under the Horlicks brand, apart from health food drinks.

Delisting buzz fuels Gillette stock surge,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/delisting-buzz-fuels-gillette-stock-surge/articleshow/28532466.cms,m.economictimes.com,Delisting buzz fuels Gillette stock surge,"The two companies, P&G and Gillette, have a long history of working in India under different names and different partners. 

 Gillette India was called Indian Shaving Products when it launched operations in India in 1984; Procter & Gamble did not exit India then, but Richardson Hindustan Ltd, the owner of the Vicks brand did. 

 P&G snapped up Richardson’s parent in a global acquisition in 1985 and entered India, adding the famous Vicks brand to its portfolio. Twenty years later in 2005, history seemed to repeat itself when P&G bought Gillette worldwide, becoming the owner of male grooming products such as shaving razors and creams. 

 For some time now, investors have been speculating about a possible open offer and delisting of Gillette India. The firm’s shares have jumped 10% in the past four days on high volumes on buzz that such an offer is imminent. Two bankers have apparently been appointed to do the process. 

 A P&G spokesperson, however said, ""This information is untrue."" According to grapevine, P&G may offer between Rs 2,800 and Rs 3,000 to minority shareholders.

Genpact Q1 net up 28% at $36 million,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/genpact-q1-net-up-28-at-36-million/articleshow/8173887.cms,m.economictimes.com,Genpact Q1 net up 28% at $36 million,"
  NEW DELHI: NYSE-listed BPO firm Genpact on Thursday upped its sales growth forecast for the year to 23% from 13% announced last quarter, buoyed by its recent acquisition of IT firm Headstrong and an improved market for outsourcing in the US. The BPO firm, which counts Wachovia, Wells Fargo and GE as top clients, posted a 28% rise in net profit to $36 million for the first quarter ended March 31. Sales of $331 million for the quarter also beat street expectations. Analysts were expecting sales of $326 million.
  
  
  ""Revenues from business process management services continue to be our growth engine,"" said Pramod Bhasin, Genpact's President and CEO. Revenue growth from GE, Genpact's largest client, almost remained flat at 0.7% from the same period last year. GE contributes about 34% to Genpact's sales.
  
  
  Genpact counts BPO firms WNS and EXL Service as its competitors, which have been on the block. Genpact on the other hand is trying to integrate IT services into its portfolio, to up its sales growth stagnated by flattish contribution from its largest client GE. Genpact's sales had grown 12% last year compared to the Indian BPO industry's growth of about 15%. 
  
  
  IT companies in India, however, grew about 27% last year. The company bought Noida-based IT firm Headstrong for $550 million last month, whose sales will be accounted for in next few quarters. Genpact will gain clients like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley with the buyout.
  
  
  Current revenues from IT services for Genpact were about 13% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2011. About 87% of Genpact's revenues for the quarter came from business process management services, up from 85% for the first quarter of 2010.
  
  
  An improved market for outsourcing has also led to rise in attrition for BPOs. Genpact's employee attrition rate for the quarter was 29%, up from 23% for the same period in 2010. As of March 31, 2011, Genpact had about 45,500 employees worldwide, an increase from 41,300 as of March 31, 2010. The firm's revenue per employee increased from $29,900 in the first quarter of 2010 to $30,700 in the quarter ending March this year. The $76-billion Indian IT-BPO industry is projected to grow about 18% this year.

Acquisitions double GCPL's topline,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/acquisitions-double-gcpls-topline/articleshow/6751120.cms,m.economictimes.com,Acquisitions double GCPL’s topline,"
  The stock of Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) rose by 3% in a weak broader market on Thursday after news of the merger of its fully owned subsidiary Godrej Household Products (GHPL) with itself. GCPL has a strong position in north India and GHPL is strong in the southern region. 
  
  The integration will help the company achieve economies of scale with higher cost synergies, better product portfolio and a stronger distribution network. 
  
  Godrej Household Products was initially a joint venture between Godrej Consumer Products and the US-based Sara Lee and Body Care. Recently, GCPL bought the 51% stake of Sara Lee and formed GHPL. 
  
  GHPL earns a major part of its revenue from home insecticides such as Good Knight and Hit. In FY10, GHPL had a total revenue of Rs 950 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 150 crore. Since GCPL earlier had only 49% stake in GHPL, it contributed a little less than 25% of the profits. 
  
  Post merger, the home insecticide business would roughly have a 40% share. Hence, the merger will help GCPL to reduce its dependence on soap products and also tackle high raw material cost caused by inflation in the soap segment.
  
  The timing of the acquisition, which took place in May-end just before the monsoons, may improve the topline of GCPL in the September quarter. According to a Tata Securities report, there is a very high correlation between monsoons and the insecticide industry. 
  
  Godrej Consumer’s net sales have more than doubled due to a series of acquisitions in the past. The company mainly operates in the personal wash, hair products and insecticides segments and aspires to grow big in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
  
  The recent acquisitions of Indonesia-based Megasarai, Africa-based Tura, and Latin America-based Issue and Argencos confirm the company’s ambition. In the past 3 months, GCPL’s stock price has increased by only 7.5% as against the 14.5% increase in the broader market Sensex. 
  
  At the current market price of Rs 401, the stock is trading at a consolidated price-earnings ratio of 33.2.

ET Now: The management of GCPL has just talked about a further improvement in the domestic market share. Is that the only trick available now?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: GCPL is not focused entirely on the domestic market.
 
 The FMCG company is insulated from the volume de-growth concerns that we have with other top FMCG companies.
 
 The company has taken a considerable time to establish itself in new geographies — the African and the South East Asian markets.
 
 It is placed second or at top slot in most of the segments that it is into. That is where you get pricing power. In such a scenario, a company like GCPL does not have to promote itself.
 
 Hence, the advertising and promotions (A&P) expenses come down significantly. In other words, selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) for the company is quite low.
 
 That is exactly what a higher market share helps you with. The cost of retaining market share should be too primitively high, which some of the domestic companies are dealing with. GCPL is surely one of the relatively undervalued stocks.
 
 You can anytime compare it with stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Britannia. That is why this stock attracts a lot of interest.

GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gail-to-benefit-most-from-rasgas-price-tweak/articleshow/49899602.cms,m.economictimes.com,GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,"ET Intelligence Group: Stocks of gas distributing companies including GAIL, Petronet LNG, Gujarat Gas, Indraprastha Gas and GSPL have risen by 13 per cent on average in a week now that renegotiation of gas prices with RasGas, a Qatar-based gas company, is turning from hope to reality. GAIL shot up 25 per cent making it the world’s best performing utility stock previous week since the company is expected to be a major beneficiary of such a renegotiation.
 
 There are three major changes in the renewed contract with RasGas, according to news reports. First, gas prices have been linked to three month average price of crude oil compared with a period of 12 months earlier. In addition to this, cap and floor have been removed from the gas pricing methodology. This means gas price will fall by half to $6-7/mmbtu from current level. Second, RasGas will postpone the recovery of liability of $1.5 billion of lesser offtake of 2015 and liability burden will be recovered in the next 13 years of remaining contract. The third factor is that the proportion of crude oil to compute gas price — in technical parlance known as slope — has been changed.
 
 Among Indian companies, GAIL will benefit on two counts. One, more gas will flow from its pipelines, which will accrue more transmission revenues. Second, lower raw material price for petrochemical division. Analysts reckon that every $1/mmbtu fall in gas price will lift GAIL’s Earning per share (EPS) for the next year by Re 1. This means price fall of $5/mmbtu will add another Rs 560 crore profitability for the GAIL.
 
 

 
 Petronet LNG will benefit since there will be no liability of $1.5 billion emerging from take or pay (ToP) clause and gradually longterm volume will move to normal level thus, lifting the utilisation of the Dahej terminal.
 
 Apart from these, gas distributors such as IGL, Gujarat Gas could also gain on the RasGas contract as this gas constitutes 10-15 per cent of their gas mix and cater to their industrial customers. Pure transporters like GSPL, while not direct beneficiaries, as they were not meaningfully impacted in the first place, could be indirect longer-term gainers as any renegotiation is a tacit acknowledgement of the LNG market having structurally changed, which should benefit importing countries like India.

Rajesh Subramaniam helped Firstsource execute a perfect turnaround,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rajesh-subramaniam-helped-firstsource-execute-a-perfect-turnaround/articleshow/28608376.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rajesh Subramaniam helped Firstsource execute a perfect turnaround,"Firstsource, one of the India's top three business process outsourcing companies, has been through hell and back. Investors, bondholders, lenders and even its employees had given up on the company in 2011: its stock had crashed to a mere Rs 10 in 2011 from Rs 70 in 2008, the company was grappling with rising debt, and facing an outstanding FCCB payment. It had no earnings to get out of this mess.

It was when Rajesh Subramaniam, who had resigned from Firstsource in 2008, was asked to come back and rescue the ship. In August 2012, Subramaniam was appointed the managing director and CEO, and since then, he has scripted an almost perfect turnaround story. Subramaniam helped the company repay debt and FCCB, consolidated facilities, broke operational silos, realigned sales functions, renegotiated unviable client agreements, and rationalise cost.

""Few months after I rejoined, we realised the magnitude of breakdown in internal governance. A lot of things had collapsed and all our stake holders had lost confidence,"" recalls Subramaniam.

""We reassessed all the assets and systems and came out with a viable option to bring Firstsource back on track,"" he said. This included realigning the processes, rationalising employee structure and renegotiating with all the clients.

Twelve months down the line, Firstsource had a new life - and a new promoter: RPG Group's Sanjiv Goenka acquired Firstsource in 2012. There were others who were interested. Vedanta Group CFO Tarun Jain and Rakesh Jhunjunwala, known as India's Warren Buffett, put in money.

Using the cash from preference allotment to promoters and other internal accruals, the company was able to pay back $237 million, or Rs 1,300 crore, FCCB in 2012. Then the company undertook various restructuring exercises: it weeded out non-profitable customers - mostly Indian clients with low margins - and identified areas of growth, especially the healthcare industry in the US.

Under the new leadership, Firstsource's profit after tax more than doubled to Rs 146 crore in FY13 from Rs 62 crore a year ago, and the stock has more than trebled to Rs 24 at present from its low of Rs 8 in 2011. The debt has also halved to Rs 1,000 crore.

But the best is yet to come, according to the new chief. ""Last year we emerged, this year we will consolidate, and next year we will start growing,"" said Subramaniam.

	 
""In the current fiscal, the company is expecting a profit after tax of over Rs 180 crore. In the next fiscal, we will grow by at least 12-15%, our operating margins will also increase by another 200 basis points and our net debt will be less than $80 million, or Rs 500 crore,"" he said.

This seems feasible given the company's focus on healthcare and insurance sectors, which account for almost 35-40% of its revenues. ObamaCare, as it is popularly known, mandates that its citizens buy health insurance in 2014 or else face penalty. This could bring 30 million Americans into the insurance net, and implies incremental volumes for both hospitals and insurers. ""We are very excited about this and are expecting a growth of over 15% in our healthcare business process outsourcing,"" said Subramaniam.

Although the company's stock has run up by over 100% in the past year, it is still trading at an attractive valuation. It is trading at FY14 price-to-earnings multiple of 9 and FY15 P/E multiple of 6.5, which is quite cheap compared with other IT peers which are trading at multiples of over 10.

""FSL continues to be an attractive story for value investors given the debt repayment roadmap, which itself could translate into market-cap gains,"" said Abhishek Shindadkar, IT analyst with ICICI Direct. ""Going by the current rate, the company will end FY16 with a net cash of at least Rs 300 crore,"" he added.

Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/facebook-rally-has-analysts-gasping-for-breath/articleshow/31859756.cms,m.economictimes.com,Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,"By Sarah Frier
 
 SAN FRANCISCO: Wall Street analysts are racing to keep up with Facebook’s stock rally. Shares of the world’s biggest social network have jumped 32% so far this year, compared with a 1.6% gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The surge has left the 49 analysts who cover Facebook in a bind -- while 38 of them recommend the company with the equivalent of a buy rating, 21 of the total now have share-price targets below where Facebook is trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That translates into an average 12-month price target of $72.46 for Facebook, less than 1% above the company’s closing price of $72.03 on Monday. 

 With the stock advancing more rapidly than anticipated, the price targets -- many of which were calculated in 2014, with several dating back to last year - - would suggest that analysts on average see little upside to the stock. That may force some of the bulls to adjust their projections, with two analysts boosting their price forecasts on Monday. 

 “Facebook stock has just ripped past expectations,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG in New York, who in October recommended buying the shares with a $68 target over the next 12 months. At the time, Facebook was trading at $49. “We’re very happy with our rating upgrade to buy, but it has all happened super fast,” he said. 

 
FACEBOOK’S TURNABOUT 

 In Germantrading on Tuesday, the stock rose less than 1% to the equivalent of $72.52 at 10:58 a.m. in Frankfurt. Facebook’s stock surge underscores how the company’s prospects have improved following its rocky stock-market debut in May 2012. 

 Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg weathered a 50% drop in the company’s stock price in the months after its initial public offering at $38, as investors questioned whether Facebook could come up with a mobile strategy with users increasingly accessing the social network from smartphones and tablets. Since then, Facebook has pushedinto mobile advertising. In January, it reported quarterly results that beat estimates, with more than half of ad revenue coming from mobile devices. Last month, Facebook ramped up its mobile business by agreeing to purchase WhatsApp for as much as $19 billion in cash and stock, betting on the mobile-messaging startup’s large international user base to accelerate growth. 

 
UNANIMOUS ANALYSIS 

 While it isn’t unheard of for a company to trade above its average analyst price target Facebook stands out because of how analysts almost unanimously agree their clients should buy the stock.

 The stock rose 12.72 per cent to hit a high of Rs 4.43 on the BSE.

ET Now: What do you make about the buzz surrounding Dish TV?  

 
Mayuresh Joshi: Their numbers are more or less in line with what the street was expecting. A couple of points that probably worked in favour of Dish was that the content costs were probably contained at around 90 to 100 odd crores and again looking at the kind of digitisation processes that are probably going through, though they have probably got extended for this fiscal, the take probably is that with MSOs probably hiking rates, players like Dish have some amount of leverage at least in terms of subscription additions and they have done a pretty good job. Whether that probably translates into ARPUs on an existing scale going forward and compounding as was the quarters go by, is something that time will decide. So our probable take is that if you are looking within this space, DTH, media, print media, we still prefer to go with the guys in the print media space.

 As per the deal details, India will set up an insurance pool led by General Insurance Co and four other insurance companies of a total amount of Rs 750 crore to indemnify companies that build reactors in the country against liabilities in case of a nuclear accident.
 
 The remaining Rs 750 crore of the total Rs 1,500 crore to offset liabilities will be provided by the government of India. This will address US concerns over clause 17 of the Indian liability Act.
 
 ""We are happy to know that an agreement has been announced between the Indian & US governments on the contentious issue of Civil Nuclear Liability. Although details would need to be studied, I feel confident that, given the strong emphasis placed by our government on ""Make in India"", the interests of all stakeholders, including domestic industries which have been steadfastly supporting India's own nuclear program, will be adequately addressed,” said MV Kotwal, Whole Time Director & President Heavy Engineering, Larsen & Toubro.
 
 The two countries will also kickstart joint production on four defense products that will be beneficial for Indian companies, say reports.
 
 According to Rajiv Memani, CEO, Ernst & Young, it is a breakthrough moment and a positive development.
 
 “Joint production of defence deals group promotes the theme of Made in India, speed up decision making process,” he told ET Now.
 
 It took six years for a breakthrough after a bilateral agreement was signed between the two countries.
 
 “We are moving towards commercial cooperation, consistent with our laws (and) international legal obligations,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the press conference.
 
 The Indian and the US companies are yet study finer details of the deal.
 
 “The details remained vague, and it was unclear whether the understanding would convince American companies, such as General Electric Co. and Westinghouse, to invest in India's civilian nuclear development,” reported Peter Baker and Ellen Barry of The New York Times.

Deepak Fertilisers bets on chemicals to deliver growth,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/deepak-fertilisers-bets-on-chemicals-to-deliver-growth/articleshow/30300794.cms,m.economictimes.com,Deepak Fertilisers bets on chemicals to deliver growth,"Deepak Fertilisers & Petrochemicals (DFPCL), a leading manufacturer of ammonium nitrate - an industrial explosive as well as a fertiliser used in agriculture - is set to benefit from the government's regulations on production, trade and imports of the chemical. The company more than doubled its capacity of ammonium nitrate in FY14, and is expanding other businesses as well.
 
 In 2012, the government had introduced ammonium nitrate rules to regulate production, transportation and warehousing of this material, when it became apparent that some people were using it for harmful purposes. The regulations became applicable from January 2014, mandating KYC norms for customers as well as transporters, numbered bagging and GPS-enabled transportation, among other things.
 
 ""The new rules are expected to increase the cost of import since ammonium nitrate is required to be imported in bagged condition,"" said Shailesh Mehta, the company's chairman and managing director. It commissioned 300,000-tonne capacity in FY14 to take its total capacity to 470,000 tonne, when India's annual consumption of technical ammonium nitrate (TAN) stands at around 700,000 tonne, growing at 7-8%.
 
 

 
 The company recorded a 33% jump in its TAN volumes in the first nine months of FY14, which emerged as the single-largest revenue earner for the company at nearly 25% of total revenues.
 
 ""Our TAN capacity utilisation stands at around 60% at present, which will go up to 80-90% in FY15,"" said Somnath Patil, president and chief financial officer of the company.
 
 The company's other specialty chemical Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), a solvent used in pharma and paint industries, has also come up well contributing 20% to the company's total turnover. This unit is already working at 100% capacity utilisation at its 70,000-tonne plant.
 
 ""The IPA requirement in the domestic market is increasing by around 6-7% from the present level of 1,10,000 tonne. Therefore, another similar plant will be needed to serve domestic requirement. We are evaluating various options for increasing capacity,"" said Mehta.
 
 Thanks to these two chemicals, in addition to nitric acid and methanol, the company's industrial chemicals segment has emerged a faster growing business with better margins, compared with the fertiliser.
 
 The company is also investing in agri-inputs business. ""We are expanding fertiliser capacity at Taloja from the existing 2.29 lakh tonne to 6-lakh tonne. This will also allow us to produce different grades of complex fertilisers as well as fortified fertilisers,"" said Mehta.
 
 There are two main concerns ahead for the company. First, the likely increase in natural gas prices from April ’14 will need raising retail prices of the fertilisers it sells, which may hamper volume growth in the short term. Second, its real estate project — a specialty mall in Pune named Ishanya — is losing money. The company is working on its turnaround, but with little success so far.
 
 Notwithstanding these worries, the company’s FY15 numbers will be significantly better than the current year. This visibility on recovery and inexpensive valuations are making the company attractive to investors. Six out of eight brokerage houses tracking the company hold a ‘Buy’ recommendation, according to Bloomberg data.
 
 “Deepak is currently trading at 4.7 times its expected FY15 earnings, which is at a discount of 30% to its long-term average,” said a report from brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher. “Dividend yield of 5% prevents further downside risk,” it added. Investors will do well to stay with the company.

  ""We will introduce more products in Africa as we look to expand our presence in the overseas market,"" Duggal said, without specifying the kind of products it plans to launch in the region. 
  
  Dabur, which sells personal care and healthcare products under brands like Dabur and Vatika, had a sales of Rs 4,110 crore. Around 22 per cent of the company's sales come from international operations. 
  
  ""In the current year we expect 28 per cent of sales coming from the overseas as the benefit of our recent acquisitions will start kicking in,"" Duggal said. 
  
  In September, 2010, the company had completed acquisition of Turkish personal care firm Hobi Kozmetik Group for USD 69 million (about Rs 324 crore) to strengthen its presence in West Asia and North Africa.

  MUMBAI: Corporation Bank has posted a 20% rise in net profit in the second quarter of this fiscal year. “The main drivers of profit growth have been net interest margin and healthy credit growth,” pointed out Corporation Bank CMD RN Pradeep, who recently took charge of the bank in September. The net profit stood at Rs 352 crore. 
  
  He said the bank has decided to focus on improving the share of low-cost deposits, which is now one-fourth of their total deposits. Low-cost deposits , include current and savings account, or CASA, wherein banks pay only 3.5% interest. “ 
  
  We have told all our corporate customers that you must give me my share of CASA by opening salary account of your employees in my bank,” said Mr Pradeep. “We are only saying that employees of at least one division or one unit of the company should have salary account with us. We have gained some share on account of this,” the bank’s share of CASA on a yearon-year basis has improved by 100 basis points from 24% to 25%.

Gross NPAs stood at Rs 740 crore against Rs 626 crore a year ago while net NPAs rose to Rs 269 crore against Rs 153 crore in the comparable period. The rise in bad loans was attributed to one account in the real estatecum-engineering sector turning bad. 
  
  “We had an exposure of Rs 54 crore and we decided to fully provide for it,” Said Mr Pradeep. Sources form the bank said the loan account was of Zoom Developers where a number of banks have cumulative exposure of Rs 2,000 crore.

  No, in fact we had been liking stocks like Coromandel and Chambal for a while. I would like to just point out that this year the agri growth should be much better than what we have seen in the last couple of years and because of which clearly the demand for fertilisers is going to move up so.

Organically, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and the consolidation of Euriware, the company reported revenue growth of 1.4%. Capgemini’s acquisition of Igate closed on July 1, and is not included in the results.

 There was a time when anything which had software in its name did very well 1999-2000 and then in 2003-2004 where anything which had infrastructure in its name did extremely well - whether or not they had something to do with infrastructure. 

 “This is the age of Bharat and everything that appears to have Bharat in its name is doing extremely well and chances are that they will keep on doing well,” said Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com. 

 “There is one investing principle that investors could use - anything that doubles once chances are that it will double again and again and again that is the power of compounding,” he added. 

 Most of the stocks which have 'Bharat' in their name are government-owned companies which are already trading way below their respective peak valuations. 

 However, most of these stocks have doubled in the last three months on the prospects of pro-growth reforms from the new government to kick start investment cycle and boost growth in Asia’s third largest economy. 

 Another reason highlighted by analysts is that most of these companies have fallen out of favour in the last decade due to unfavourable government policies. 

 PSUs mcap has shrunk to 20 per cent of BSE 100 at present compared with 32 per cent in March 2005. Lower proportion of mcap offers significant room to investors to increase exposure and secure risk-reward ratio, ET reported. 

 “If government can take hard decisions, then the Indian growth story is here to stay and most stocks under the name Bharat may very well outperform benchmark indices,” said A K Prabhakar, Independent Market Expert. 

 “Most of the Bharat stocks are PSUs other than BHARAT FORGE and have the potential to become multibaggers from current levels,” he added.

  KOLKATA: Riding on the retail boom, shoe major Bata India has clocked a 35.39% rise in net profit in Q4 of calendar 2010. The net profit soared to Rs 34.39 crore in Q4 of CY10 as compared to Rs 25.40 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The net sales of the company has shown a 23.5% growth to Rs 355.85 crore as compared to Rs 288.09 crore in Q4 of CY09. 
  
  At 9:45 am, shares of the company were trading 1.03% up at Rs 352.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The profit-before-tax (PBT) of the company in Q4 of CY10 has gone up by 42.6% to Rs 142.99 crore against Rs 100.26 crore in the same period last year. 
  
  For the entire CY10, Bata India’s net profit has soared to Rs 95.35 crore — growth of 41.84% over the previous year. The net sales of the company in CY10 went up by 14.41% to Rs 1,256.85 crore from Rs 1,090.17 crore in CY09. 
  
  Bata India attributes this growth to the new retail strategy adopted by the company. Bata India Group Managing Director Marcelo Villagran said: “During 2010, we opened 108 stores, each with an area of more than 3,000 sq ft. With separate defined sections, offering hundreds of designs for men, ladies, children and youth, the new Bata stores offer a whole new experience to consumers. Made as per Bata's global design, the new stores use the latest retail designs and best quality furniture that enhance the store's layout and provide for an attractive product display.”

Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/restructuring-helps-bata-india-stay-a-step-ahead/articleshow/7566695.cms,m.economictimes.com,Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,"
  Bata India's business-model restructuring appears to be paying off well. For the year 2010, the company clocked a growth of 42% in its standalone earnings while net sales grew by 15%. 
  
  Brand repositioning and operational restructuring were the two key areas at the heart of the revamping exercise. The company introduced and expanded high-margin premium brands such as Hush Puppies, North Star and Weinbrenner. It also optimised its chain of retail outlets by opening large-format stores, closing down the less profitable ones and renovating the rest. 
  
  On the operational front, the company began outsourcing the production of its low-cost merchandise. The key benefit of this move was a steady reduction in the overall raw material cost to 46.1% of net sales in 2010 from 48.1% three years ago. Besides, it also brought down staff costs to 13.9% of sales from 20.6% during the same period. The company is expanding its retail outlets network to enhance market reach. In 2010, it opened 108 stores, taking the total count to 1,300. It plans to open 50-60 stores in tier-II and tier-III cities annually to increase market penetration. It has also launched new complementary services such as online shopping and Bata Home Delivery service. 
  
  The benefits of these steps are already visible in the company's operating profit margins, which has improved from 8.6% in 2007 to 14% in 2010. The December quarter proved to be the best of the year, with the company clocking a year-on-year net sales growth of 23% compared with the average 11.3% year-on-year growth for the first three quarters. The operating margin for the quarter at 17.3% was also the highest; for the first three quarters, the average was 12.7%. 
  
  The company is also trying to become an approved supplier to the armed forces. It has acquired technology from its parent company to make shoes as required by the defence personnel. The demand from the domestic defence forces alone stands at 1.2 million pairs every year; if it is approved as a supplier, Bata's earnings would get a substantial boost. Another revenue booster will be development of its 260-acre land in Batanagar, near Kolkata, in a 50:50 joint venture with the Calcutta Metropolitan Group. Bata India has deployed around 73 crore since 2007 for setting up a township; the first phase is expected to be commissioned some time later in 2011. The township is expected to be completed by 2013. 
  
  Given the company's growth, the current price-to-earning multiple of 23 does not seem high.

  All these commodity related stories, steel, aluminium, copper, they are all running up this afternoon. How are you reading into the news, what do you make of it? 
  
  With China making the currency flexible, the sense that we are getting is that there would be more purchasing power and with the economy doing well, there would be more demand for base metal. So steel, copper, we will see these base metal prices going up. 
  
  If you look at Sesa Goa particularly, one of the Japanese steel manufactures have increased the purchase price by 23%, most of these companies now work on quarterly contracts. So that augurs well for Sesa Goa. Having said that with China making its currency flexible, we will see lot of liquidity flows happening in the emerging market and we expect the US dollar to depreciate between 3% to 5% in next 3 to 6 months’ time.

 People first started talking seriously about the potential for Apple to become a trillion dollar company in February when shares reached news highs.

 It's not just the launch of the Apple Watch that has White so bullish. He's also optimistic about Apple's iPhone portfolio in China, which he says is poised to benefit from a new upgrade cycle following the expanding 4G network, as well as potential new areas of interest such as an electric car.

Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/capacity-addition-to-help-apl-apollo/articleshow/6695006.cms,m.economictimes.com,Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,"
  Stock of APL Apollo Tubes, a Delhi-based steel tube manufacturer, has consistently outperformed the markets with yearly returns of 160% compared to a 20% rise in Sensex. The company’s recently commissioned capacities and the planned acquisition of Lloyds Line Pipes is set to give a booster to its earnings in the coming quarters.
  
  Incorporated in 1986, APL Apollo Tubes is a manufacturer and exporter of steel pipes and tubes. It produces a wide range of steel tubes including black tubes, galvanised tubes, pre-galvanised tubes and hollow sections.
  
  The company doubled its production capacity to 4 lakh tonnes per annum by adding a new plant in Hosur. The plant, which was under trial runs till July, will make its presence felt from the September quarter. The new plant will cater to the growing demand from South India.
  
  The company has also forged a strategic partnership with a leading distributor, Shankara Pipes, under which the company will allot around 2% of its equity shares on preferential basis to the latter at `176 each. This is at around 11% premium to its current market price. The relationship is expected to help in increasing the company’s presence in southern and western markets.
  
  At present, the exports account for only about 5% of APL Apollo’s revenue, which the copmany wants to increase going forward.
  
  The recently-announced acquisition of the Maharashtra-based manufacturer of steel tubes and pipes Lloyds Line Pipes for `40 crore, which will be completed later this year, will boost the capacity by 90,000 tonne per annum besides improving access to customers in the Western region.
  
  The company reported net sales growth of 19% y-o-y in the June 2010 quarter. The company, however, saw its profit declining 18% due to presence of other income in the last year’s profit. As the company operates with low operating margins, it depends on volume to boost its profits.
  
  At the current market price of `158 the stock is trading at 15 times to trailing 12-month EPS. This is to a premium to most of its peers. However, considering its recently doubled capacities, the premium appears justified.

  So that is looking pretty good for Alok Industries and Shoppers Stop has taken a sideways view now for about 6-7 months and it is pretty much there, 300 on the downside, 380-385 on the upside. It is still trending very much within that range, exactly in the middle of that range in fact. So one would say this is a stock that is going nowhere right now.

  MUMBAI: Allahabad Bank has reported a 21% rise in its net profit at Rs 403 crore for the quarter to September 2010, over Rs 334 crore in the corresponding period last year. Profits were driven by a rise in business, coupled with an improvement in margin. Bank chairman JP Dua attributed the rise to improvement in income from core business.
   
  The bank which saw its total business touch Rs 1.96 lakh crore, aims to cross Rs 2 lakh crore by December and Rs 2.20 lakh crore by March next year, Mr Dua said. The bank’s net interest margin increased to 3.34% for the September quarter compared with 3.10% in the previous quarter. At the start of the fiscal, we announced that we would like to keep NIM over 3%. So far, we have maintained this target, Mr Dua said. 
  
  The Kolkata-based bank’s operating profit for the period rose 20% at Rs 782 crore from Rs 650 crore in the corresponding period in 2009. Total income rose 22% to Rs 2,982 crore against Rs 2,452 crore. It made a provision of Rs 379 crore towards non-performing assets, income tax and others. 
  
  Mr Dua said the bank had to make a whopping Rs 220 crore of provision only towards NPAs on account of agriculture debt relief scheme. The scheme expired on June this year but a significant chunk of farmers did not avail of the benefit, making them defaulters of bank loans. 
  
  Gross NPA ratio deteriorated to 1.77% as on September 2010 from 1.5% three months ago. Net NPAs deteriorated to 0.56% from 0.41% due to rising incidents of defaults in the farm sector. The bank is adequately capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.49%. Yet, it has headroom of Rs 2,600 crore to raise capital.

Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/catch-up-game-bse-mid-cap-index-trails-bigger-peers/articleshow/32635789.cms,m.economictimes.com,Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,"The BSE mid-cap index, which rallied in tandem with the benchmark indices in 2007 to touch an all-time high, has under-performed over the last 18 months as projected earnings growth at the start of FY14 was much lower when calculated on an annualised basis. The projected earnings growth for the BSE mid-cap index in April 2013 was over 25%, which has now been lowered down to 16per cent. Though the benchmark indices are trading at an all-time high, the BSE mid-cap is trading 33per cent away from the lifetime peak it scaled in 2007.
 
 Over the last one year, the BSE mid-cap index has been under-performing the Nifty as most of its constituents have witnessed a gradual downward revision in earnings. The majority of constituents or companies which constitute the BSE mid-cap index have seen a downward revision, as most brokerages had pinned hopes of a recovery in growth from the third quarter of FY14. The brokerages have built in a profit contribution of over 55-60per cent in the second half of FY14, but with little changes in the macro environment and muted demand, they were bound to revise their earnings downward.
 
 According to Bloomberg, the mid-cap index EPS for FY14 has fallen by 20per cent to 485 since September last year. On the other hand, the Nifty’s EPS for FY14 has been upgraded by 9per cent to 452 during the same period. Of the 216 constituents of the BSE mid-cap, only 32 stocks have seen an upward revision of EPS since September 2013.
 
 On the valuation front, the BSE Mid-cap Index is trading at a lower valuation compared with the Nifty. The difference of P/E (price-earning) multiple of two indices, which is known as PE spread shows the amount of premium or discount an investor is willing to pay to buy for a higher risk mid-cap stock.
 
 If the PE spread is lower than the historical average, it indicates that investors are not overtly bullish about the mid-cap stocks compared to benchmark indices with limited prospects for a build-up in the stock. In 2007, on a historical basis, the BSE mid-cap PE (price-earnings) was trading at a premium valuation to the Nifty. The BSE Mid-cap was trading at 23 times in November 2007 when the Nifty traded at 21 times.
 
 Among the constituents of the BSE Midcap, companies whose EPS has been revised upwards, have seen a significant gain since the start of the year. Even the interest of institutional investors such as foreign institutional investors and also mutual funds had been largely concentrated on companies of the BSE midcap constituents where they perceive a fair amount of revenue visibility and see an upward revision in EPS. That is why midcap stocks that rallied recently were the ones whose EPS were upgraded by analysts.
 
 Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Bharat Forge and IPCA have seen a consistent increase in FII holding during the last three quarters. From the start of the year, the BSE mid-cap gained 434 points, of which 80per cent of the contribution came from stocks such as Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, MRF, IPCA, and TVS Motors. Among these, Aurobindo Pharma received the highest EPS upgradation of 23per cent due to which its stock appreciated by 36per cent. Besides this, Apollo Tyres’ stock gained 34per cent as its EPS was upgraded by 21per cent.

 New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, was up nine cents at $95.81 in mid-morning trade while Brent North Sea crude for March gained 26 cents at $106.95. 

 WTI sank 92 cents in New York trade Monday while Brent fell $1.19 in London, tracking heavy losses in global equity markets spurred by weak corporate earnings and uncertainty in emerging economies. 

 Financial markets have also been shaken by data last week indicating manufacturing activity in China -- the world's top energy consumer and a key driver of global growth -- had contracted in January. 

 ""Markets remain skittish and the mood is somewhat cautious as the focus remains on emerging market travails,"" French lender Credit Agricole said in a note. 

 ""The current bout of pressure may yet be contained but there is still some way to go before market stress is alleviated,"" it said. 

 Kelly Teoh, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said investors were also keenly awaiting the outcome of a two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled to end tomorrow. 

 The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to decide on a further $10 billion reduction in its monthly asset purchases, to $65 billion. 

 In December, the FOMC said it would begin tapering the stimulus by $10 billion to $75 billion a month in January. 

 The so-called tapering of the Fed's asset purchases would likely boost the greenback, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for countries using other currencies, dampening demand.

Mitesh Thacker: On the index, we still have not changed our stance. But given the fact that we are getting close to the upper end of the range which is around 8300, there is a good chance that we might see some momentum come. In that case we may close above levels of 8300. Lot of individual stocks, specific names are breaking out and giving nice movement. The breadth is about 2.5 is to 1. That is a very positive side. So the chances are that if not today, maybe in the next one-two days, we might get a breakout above 8300. That could possibly suggest further upside in the Nifty in the short term.

 NSE Nifty futures' open interest has been on a decline since March 3, but Bank Nifty futures' aggregate OI remained positive during the same period.Meanwhile, SGX Nifty futures' aggregate open interest remains near the year's peak touched February 26.
 
 Total F&O turnover in Indian exchanges continues to rise after March derivative series became active. Bulk of the action is witnessed in index call options, which are probably seeing unwinding after Nifty hit a peak on March 4. This reasoning is also supported by the rise in the PC ratio of index open interest. It has been on a rise lately, but is still below a year's average.
 PC ratio of stocks' OI is also below average, and there is hardly any stock active in the F&O segment with PC ratio above 1. It is possible that the recent price falls in stocks may have attracted more interest in calls, but such a bias increases the risk of magnifying falls if stocks were to slide further. 

 Meanwhile, FII net equity investment remained positive since February 16. However, the combined trade volume of cash segment in NSE & BSE has remained below a year's average for over two weeks now, suggesting that traders in the equity segment are looking for fresh cues after Budget announcement. 

 India VIX, an indicator of volatility based on the Nifty index option prices is at 17.38, and has been easing since February derivatives' expiry. Open interest distribution across the put-call spectrum of Nifty hints at 8600-9000 as the region that traders have estimated the price moves to be in, in the event of a rise in volatility.

Ltd. 

We saw a smart 2% upmove on the Bank Nifty and the IndusInd Bank counter was high by 4.5% yesterday. Kotak Bank was high by almost 3.5% in trade. Has the time for banks finally arrived? We are talking about the capex cycle which can also be played.I guess the time cannot be better than this, wherein it reassures us that the economy is progressing well. Banks are progressing as far as lending is concerned. Up till now, private banks have been concentrating on the retail side of the book, which they continue to do but in the last quarter and a little earlier, from January to March till now and from April to June quarter, systematically the corporate lending side of the book has started increasing.
 
The growth rate in that particular area has also increased. In my view, the corporate credit offtake is taking place at this point of time and no wonder because on one hand, the infrastructure-led spending is happening in the economy and PLI schemes are outside the interactive new investment into the economy. At the same time, most of the companies are getting ready for the next phase of growth – call it Brownfield or Greenfield expansion.
 
All in all, put together, the bank’s credit requirement is on the higher side. At the same time, with the rise in commodity prices, the requirement for working capital has started increasing for most of the corporates and they are again asking banks to fund them. As a result, we had seen the credit offtake. So maybe, the results should reflect into what you call companies earnings in subsequent quarters but the lending activity starts now, the sanctioning of the loans starts now and should this particular thing continue, we are going to see the next two to four quarters reflecting the earnings.
 
With a higher amount of growth, and that is where I would argue that some of the larger banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI, need to be considered for the portfolio largely because of the fact that the sheer size is slowing. At the same time, the business condition is improving and these banks remained very disciplined during the pandemic period and did not expand their book, Now they are getting an opportunity to expand their book size with the kind of alpha payment side, I think it is a better time to buy as far as the timing is concerned in the market.
 

Why do you enjoy this reputation that you are never bearish? It is very difficult to find a sell idea from Deven Choksey? We were definitely bullish in every condition because in my career span of more than three decades, at every stage, this market has seen higher amount of growth, whatever the situation in the economy has been. I have done some eight year cycle analysis and I think in every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money. 
 
So I remain bullish of course for the India economy and its growth. Also, we are now probably into the $5-trillion zone, sooner than later and in such a situation, we need to remain bullish because the market cap is likely to double from current levels. All in all, put together, if one wants to make money from the stock market, it is always good to remain an optimist. But things can go wrong even after remaining optimistic.

 

If I have to put a graphic which says Deven’s multibagger idea or ideas for this decade – stocks which can make a lot of wealth in five, six years – which will be those one, two, three names?There are a couple of stocks where I probably keep my focus on currently. I feel HDFC, HDFC Life as a combination is triggering a Rs 50 lakh- crore AUM company. In the next four and a half to five years, should they continue with a growth rate of around 20% odd in the housing finance portfolio, the possibility of continuing with this kind of a growth rate is very high.
 
In retail also, the growth rate on a larger base of AUM will continue to be very high. In the corporate sector, they would be more cautious but I would still think that around 15-16% kind of a growth rate is definitely possible on a larger base. Should this particular portfolio of lending continue to grow at this pace, then on a Rs 50 lakh crore size balance sheet, somewhere in 4.5-5 years time from now, I think this combination could give a nice reward. Even if you compound the return at 25%, you will get a reasonably good amount of appreciation in a four to five years’ time frame. So this is one company which is probably right to buy into. 
 
The second stock where we believe the opportunity is emerging stronger is going to be L&T Technology Services. I would think that beyond the kind of engineering services that they have, coupled with IT and the way the economy is growing and the investment space, would demand higher IT usage after even 5G comes in. This is going to be more of a trusted space. This company is a niche player like Tata Elxsi in the engineering-based IT solutions and that is where I believe that staying with this company for four, five years could give multi bagger returns, something that we have experienced in the case of Tata Elxsi.

Nine banks keen on Hind Copper FPO mandate,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/nine-banks-keen-on-hind-copper-fpo-mandate/articleshow/6091097.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nine banks keen on Hind Copper FPO mandate,"
  BANGALORE: Hindustan Copper’s chairman and managing director Shakeel Ahmed said on Thursday that nine investment banks have shown interest in managing the firm’s follow-on public offer (FPO). He added that the company will finalise the names before the end of the month. “We are planning our FPO in September or October this year.” 
  
  “Nine banks, including DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak, ICICI Securities, SBI Capital Markets, IDBI, UBS, IDFC-SSKI besides Avendus Capital and Enam, are keen to participate in our fund-raising exercise,” he said. Mr Ahmed clarified that while the FPO will see the company dilute only 20% of its equity, the balance 5-6% will be done subsequently to meet the new minimum public shareholding norm of 25%. Currently a minuscule 0.41% of the company’s equity is traded on the bourses. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said the company was planning to raise funds to partially finance its Rs 4,580- crore capex plans. This investment, which will be done over the next 5-6 years, will see close to 70% funds being raised through equity dilution, the balance being debt and internal accruals. 
  
  The capex will see HCL hiking production capacity at its Khetri (Rajasthan) plant to 3.1 mt from 1 mt. Similarly, the Malanjikhand (Jharkhand) plant’s capacity will rise to 5 mt from the current 2 mt. The Ghatsila (Jharkhand) unit’s new capacity will be 3.9 mt from 0.4-0.6 mt. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said that HCL will expand copper exploration and mining activity as copper consumption has risen due to rapid economic growth. “India’s current consumption is only 5.5 lakh tonne and we lag behind China and the US, which consume 61 lakh tonne and 19 lakh tonne respectively,” he added. He said that the Rajasthan government had recommended the firm’s name for copper mining at Bannivaliki Dhani. HCL was scouting for mines in Chile and Namibia. 
  
  “These are still at a nascent stage. There are a lot of regulatory issues like ownership pattern of the venture, mining rights and the like,” he added. Mr Ahmed said that the company had begun a dialogue with Karnataka’s Hutti Gold Mines to revive the copper mines at Chitradurga. 
  
  “HCL could look at a joint-venture or outright purchase or a supply contract from this mine, which has reserves of nearly 2 mt, and closed in 2001 as global copper prices fell to $ 2,500 per tonne,” he added. HCL shares inched up 0.49% to Rs 495.3 on Thursday.

Gaurang Shah: We have recently come out with overall view on the banking and NBFC segment and wherein we have upgraded the targets for most of the private sector banks and HDFC is one of them.  A target stand at about close to 800-820 and our belief is that the performance that we have seen over the last couple of quarters has been quite consistent though there has been a slight bit of deterioration.  Given the way both HDFC and HDFC Bank has created value for an individual portfolio, my understanding is that notwithstanding what happens in the short term, if you look at the long term then definitely both these stocks they add value to an individual’s portfolio. so I would say hold on to it."
"FDI, discom policies show reform momentum intact: Fitch",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fdi-discom-policies-show-reform-momentum-intact-fitch/articleshow/49756732.cms,m.economictimes.com,"FDI, discom policies show reform momentum intact: Fitch","NEW DELHI: Fitch Ratings has said liberalisation of foreign investment rules announced earlier this week is a significant structural macroeconomic reform and the recent proposal to de-stress power distribution sector indicates that India's reform momentum remains intact. 

 There has been worry that after the setback suffered by the ruling NDA in the Bihar elections reforms momentum may slow down. 

 “The FDI and disco (distribution companies) announcements highlight how the government can make reform progress using its regulatory and executive powers,” Fitch said in a statement adding that reforms indicate India’s reforms momentum remains intact. 
 

 On Tuesday, in a significant reform of its foreign direct investment policy, the government had opened up as many as 15 sectors more, lifting caps for many sectors, putting others on automatic routed and easing other conditions for others, notably brand retail. 

 The power sector package announced on November 5, seeks to reboot the burdened distribution sector by transferring three-fourth of their debt to respective state government and archiving the rest 25% through long term bonds. 

 “These changes align with the government's broad-based reform agenda, and should support investment and real GDP growth over the long term,” said Fitch, said adding that the two measures suggest government can press ahead with reforms. 

 There is fear that the government will find it difficult to push through legislative reforms after the Bihar setback with emboldened opposition raising the pitch on some of the contentious measures, a point noted by Fitch. 

 It said: “However, other big reforms such as the implementation of a national value added tax, will require a two-thirds approval in the legislature and face stiffer political obstacles.” 

 The government wants to roll out GST from April 1, 2016 but the legislation needed to do so is stuck in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling coalition does not have a majority. 

 The ratings agency has forecast 7.5% growth in the current financial year and 8% each in the next two years. 

 Fitch noted that power package could raise general government debt up to 2% of GDP, but added this was not likely to impact India's ratings because of the positive impact of other reforms. 

 “Importantly, the reforms create an incentive structure for state governments to reduce losses at discos by requiring the state governments to assume a certain share of losses at these entities,” it said.

Broader markets valuations look attractive: Ambit Capital,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/broader-markets-valuations-look-attractive-ambit-capital/articleshow/21000783.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Broader markets valuations look attractive: Ambit Capital,"MUMBAI: The midcaps and smallcaps have been underperforming the Sensex on Y-o-Y basis. The recent volatility in the Indian markets due to rupee depreciation has also put pressure on the broader markets. 

 Gaurav Mehta, Technical Analyst, Ambit Capital is of the view that while the Nifty is at the beginning of a bull run, the valuations of broader markets look attractive as compared to largecaps. 

 ""Relative valuations of small caps to large caps (as measured by a P/B ratio of BSE Small Cap Index to BSE Sensex are at multi-year lows; historically these cheap valuations have been followed by market rallies. A similar picture can be painted for the relative valuations of mid caps to large caps suggesting broader markets offer good value, both absolutely and more so on a relative basis,"" he said. 

 According to him, a long run bullish phase is around the corner for Indian equities. He sees the Nifty testing 6,350 over the next few weeks and successfully breach it on the upside. 

 ""Nifty on log, weekly charts has carved out an ascending triangle over the last few years. Such patterns are usually resolved to the upside implying a breakout from the 6,300-6,400 resistance range is a high likelihood over the next few weeks. More importantly the major uptrend that we embarked upon in 2003 is still intact as well. On the flip side, 5,650-5,700 should be a region of strong long term support for the index,"" he added. 

 The ""Real"" or inflation adjusted Nifty suggests that the secular uptrend that started in 2003 is still intact for Indian equities, he says. 

 ""While downsides should be limited to the lower trendline (we are there already currently), a resolution of this pattern to the upside would imply massive upsides in the months ahead- this implies risk reward is favorable for buying Indian equities,"" he said. 

 At 12:40 p.m.; the S&P BSE Sensex was at 19,446.42, up 6.94 points or 0.04 per cent. The index has gained 10.23 per cent in one-year period.

After a gap of two years, jewellery exporters are witnessing orders coming from the US for jewellery and the units operating in Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) in Mumbai are flooded with enquiries. 

 The US jobs data for June has also sparked a fresh hope among jewellers. The US economy added a net 195,000 new jobs in June, official figures show. The figure is well above economists’ expectations of 165,000. 

 “Jewellers are expecting a 25%-30% growth in the US market in the current fiscal. The US is gradually coming out of recession and this is reflected in the enquiries that are coming from the country. We are seeing this sort of a demand after a gap of almost two years,” said Vipul Shah, chairman of Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council. 

 An increase in exports of gem and jewellery is a good news for the government which is trying hard to control the rising current account deficit (CAD) by curbing gold imports through a slew of measures. But for jewellery exporters, the government is ready to walk an extra mile. 

 Shah said Union commerce minister Anand Sharma has held a meeting with jewellery exporters and assured them of a steady supply of gold for exports. “He said that if any nominated agencies fail to supply gold, he would take action against them,” Shah said. 

 The jewellery units operating in SEEPZ are receiving a good flow of orders. Rajeev S Pandya, past president, SEEPZ Gems & Jewellery Manufacturers Association, said: “There has been an improvement in order position from June end. The industry had organised a jewellery show in Las Vegas in early June. The samples shown there have been well accepted by customers and they have started placing orders. 

 These are orders for the Christmas season. Some of the units in SEEPZ have their hands full while some have started receiving orders from the US. The US is compensating for the loss in Europe.” The Europe market is still reeling under a crisis and jewellers do not see an immediate recovery in that market. 

 “However, the West Asia and China markets are showing a good growth,” said Shah.

 The stocks market came under selling pressure this week due to profit booking at higher levels. A set of good corporate quarterly numbers was discounted quickly. Stocks of companies that reported numbers in line or above estimates maintained status quo in prices, but companies whose Q2 numbers were below expectations got hammered. 

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have slowed down their buying spree and have gone into a wait and watch mode, awaiting the Bihar poll results. The market will remain subdued till the first week of November. 

 
Events of the week:  

 The US Federal Reserve in its bimonthly meeting for the first time gave a reasonable indication that US interest rates are likely to increase before the yearend, causing a flurry in global financial markets. 

 Domestic stock exchanges this week revised the contract value to minimum Rs 5 lakh in the derivatives segment, potentially impacting the liquidity in market. 

 The IPO of IndiGo although got over-subscribed six times, the retail investors quota went partially unsubscribed, indicating that market sentiments are bearish for the short term. At the same time, it also clearly showed that a huge bull market wrapped by frenzied activities of retail investors is yet to come. 

 
Technical outlook:  

 The Nifty50 has moved into profit-taking mode after rising 10 per cent since last month. The 8,100-8,000 levels are crucial for Nifty50 for medium-term strength. However, a close below 8,000 would indicate a reversal of the medium-term uptrend, which may potentially correct the entire rally since the beginning of September. 

 If the trend weakens and key levels are breached than Nifty50 can go down all the way to 7,800 level. The probability of continued weakness is high as the market is awaiting the important outcome of Bihar elections. 

 
Expectations for the coming week: 

 The mood of the market should remain mildly bearish with bouts of selling in stocks of companies that have reported earnings below expectations. Foreign investors have started hedging their long positions and have shifted to a wait-and-watch mode. 

 Corporate results have been good so far with fewer negative surprises, although majority of them have managed to keep the past momentum but the acceleration was clearly missing. The market can go into sideways consolidation with a negative bias for want of fresh triggers. 

 The market will most likely wait for Bihar election results before any substantial move. Nifty50 ended the week down by 2.70 per cent to close at 8,065.80.

This even as total rainfall so far this season is 10% above normal.“The steady progress of monsoon has already resulted in many commodities coming off their highs but we are still keeping a watch on the market,” Ramesh Abhishek, chairman, FMC told ET. 

 Chana, castorseed, coriander and jeera have witnessed significant volatility in recent times, especially after fears of a deficient monsoon cropped up. To tackle ‘abnormal’ volatility, exchanges at FMC’s instance have advanced the delivery period in the likes of castor, chana and coriander and even introduced additional margins on longs and shorts. As a result of these regulatory actions, entities attempting to squeeze sellers by cornering stocks in the physical markets and simultaneously mounting bullish bets in the futures market were forced out of the market. This reduced excessive volatility in counters like castor which saw historic delivery worth Rs 948 crore in the January contract on NCDEX. 

 So far 29,369 tonnes of castor have been delivered in the June contract that expires on June 19, 8500 tonnes in chana and 100 tonnes in coriander. The FMC this month advanced the delivery period in chana and coriander from June 11 to June 4 which resulted in those trying to manipulate the counters moving out of the market at the risk of being forced to take delivery a broker said. Nine of the ten top clients were net long castor on Thursday, the same being the case in chana, NCDEX data shows.

The move is aimed at attracting bigger private equity and venture capital investment in the booming ecommerce sector and other emerging areas.
 
 The finance ministry is looking at allowing greater pricing flexibility for securities with an exit valuation clause at a rate set beforehand, technically known as a ‘call and put option.’ “There are issues with pricing of quasi-equity instruments... We are examining the norms,” a senior government official aware of the development told ET, confirming that the regulations were being reviewed.
 
 The ‘call and put option’ rules have undergone frequent changes, creating policy confusion and delays that undermine business sentiment, according to experts.
 
 It was this year’s finance Act that shifted control on equity capital flows to the finance ministry from the Reserve Bank of India, giving the government power to review these rules. However, the government has to administer these in consultation with the central bank.
 
 
 
TATA-DOCOMO CASE
 
 In January, the RBI had suggested allowing the transfer of shares by a nonresident investor at a price higher than their fair value in view of the Indian partner's contractual commitments in the Tata-DoCoMo case. The policy allowed for a fair valuation different from the exit valuation agreed between the two investors in the telecom venture. The RBI’s view was that the contractual agreement should be honoured and pitched for a change in policy. The finance ministry, wary of changing the existing policy in one instance, asked RBI to take a view on the case in line with the central bank's own guidelines. It subsequently took over jurisdiction of the policy in the February budget.
 
 
CASE FOR MORE FELXIBILITY
 
 The Narendra Modi-led government, which has launched the Make in India initiative among others to boost economic activity, is keen to attract foreign capital to spur the country's manufacturing sector.
 
 Last week, the union cabinet cleared a policy to allow fungibility of all forms of foreign capital within sectoral caps as part of its drive to make the country a more attractive destination for overseas investors. The review of the ‘call and put option’ pricing rules are part of the government's push to iron out difficulties they posed for investment of risk capital in emerging areas. The central bank had also written to the finance ministry on the issue of pricing norms governing exits and the need to re-examine the existing policy. Industry has sought changes as well. “The pricing norms should facilitate the execution of the real commercial understanding between the parties, especially concerning the put/call option pricing for the deal, irrespective of the fair market valuation of the shares,” said Punit Shah, partner, Dhruva Advisors.
 
 
TROUBLED PAST
 
 A ‘call’ option allows the holder to buy shares in an entity at an agreed price, while a ‘put’ option allows an investor to sell. Though popular, these instruments were not looked upon with too much favour by the RBI as it was worried that they would lead to foreign debt coming in disguised as equity. Put options, which give special rights to foreign investors to sell back equity if certain conditions such as timely listing are not fulfilled by Indian company, were seen largely as facilitating debt flows that would go out after a certain period.
 
 In 2011, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), taking its cue from the RBI, had even banned these instruments but soon retracted the policy measure over fears it could slow down foreign investment. In 2013 the RBI, finance ministry, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and DIPP reached an understanding on these instruments and agreed to allow them with a one-year lock-in period after adhering to pricing norms.
 
 In its rules, the RBI said exits could not be at a price higher than that arrived at on the basis of return on equity, a change from the earlier norm based on the discounted cash flow method it had specified. After representations against this condition, in July 2014, the RBI said any internationally recognised pricing methodology would be accepted.
 
 The RBI's views in the case of Tata NTT DoCoMo were thus seen as a complete reversal of its earlier stance against such instruments.
 
 
Let them plan their exit 

 The rules for pricing of ‘call and put option’ have rarely been objective, informed more often than not by the fear of debt entering in the guise of equity. Such fears do not sit well with India’s attempts to bring private equity and venture capital to fund avalanche of ideas by the internet generation. And India’s external account is no longer vulnerable to a few billion dollars flowing out. Investors putting up risk money to funds innovation need to be commensurately rewarded. Simpler rules are called for to govern how companies provide exit to foreign investors. Within a broad framework this needs to be left to the companies.

Helion co-founder Kanwaljit Singh moving out as VC firm names two new partners,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/helion-co-founder-kanwaljit-singh-moving-out-as-vc-firm-names-two-new-partners/articleshow/41813692.cms,m.economictimes.com,Helion co-founder Kanwaljit Singh moving out as VC firm names two new partners,"MUMBAI: Venture capital firm Helion is seeing top level management changes as co-founder and senior managing director Kanwaljit Singh is moving out of the firm to ""pursue his interests in the consumer space,"" according to a statement. The firm has also announced elevation of two of its directors, Ritesh Banglani and Rahul Chowdhri, as partners at the venture fund. 

 Singh had set up Helion in 2006 along with Ashish Gupta, Sanjeev Aggarwal and Rahul Chandra. While Gupta and Aggarwal are at the level of senior MD, Chandra is an MD at the venture capital firm which manages $600 million across funds. Singh will stay with Helion till March 2016 and effect a smooth transition. 

 ""This comes at a time when the fund has considerably increased the focus on technology investing,"" said the statement from Helion. 

 Former co-head of venture capital at Carlyle in India, Singh primarily focused on consumer sector investments at Helion Venture. He serves on boards of Fashionara, HummingBird, YLG Salons, Qwikcilver, Mast Kalandar, Yepme, Attano and LifeCell. 

 In his previous stints before venture capital, Singh worked as marketing head for Intel South Asia before which he was at Hindustan Unilever for a decade in functions like sales, marketing and product innovation. 

 Singh’s move coincides with Helion promoting two of its relatively younger team members. Chowdhri, former Microsoft executive, has been associated with Helion since inception and worked on investments like salon chain YLG and online test prep startup Toppr. Bangalani joined in 2010 from IDG Ventures and has worked on investments like cab aggregator TaxiForSure and realty classifieds portal Housing. 

 Helion Ventures, which has offices in Delhi and Bangalore, has been one of the most active investors in Indian startups over the last 7-8 years. Some of the firms well known investments include online travel portal MakeMyTrip and bus ticketing website RedBus, both of which it has exited.

Here why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/heres-why-devi-shetty-of-narayana-health-is-looking-to-hit-dalal-street/articleshow/48751746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Here's why Devi Shetty of Narayana Health is looking to hit Dalal Street,"One afternoon last month, Dr Devi Shetty, who usually speaks to journalists as a philosopher would to an acolyte, sat in his gleaming office in the Narayana Health (NH) campus looking rather uneasy.

“According to Sebi rules, my lawyers say I’m not supposed to talk about future plans or financials,” he said, the words not sitting as comfortably on his tongue as cryoprecipitate just had. He sat back self-consciously. “But I can talk about healthcare in general, or maybe not... I don’t know, let’s see.”

It’s the most inarticulate anyone might have seen the good doctor. The reason for this unusual reticence is that NH is planning to launch a public issue soon. The multispecialty hospital chain, valued at an estimated Rs 5,000 crore and currently financed by investors CDC and JP Morgan, hopes to raise Rs 1,200-1,500 crore from the market.

So, although Shetty had agreed to a conversation at this pivotal moment, it called for a certain guardedness and occasional disclaimers. The IPO his biggest expansion plan yet was like a flashing billboard we were desperately trying not to look at.

Dr Shetty was in loose blue scrubs, a surgical mask dangling at his neck. His hands were pink with just-washed germlessness and he exuded the distracted calm of surgeons. He had a bypass in a couple of hours. “Do you mind if I ate lunch while we talked?” Out came a steel lunch carrier from home: rotis, vegetables, curd and mangoes but he kept going for the Mangalorean fish fry.

As he ate, he evoked the elusive dream of shedding all administrative responsibilities to simply be a cardiac surgeon. “I had to set up a whole hospital chain to be able to come back to doing the work I love, the way I want to do it,” he said laughing and chewing.

“That’s the magic and pain of entrepreneurship.” But an IPO and public listing will add several responsibilities that will inevitably fight for attention with cardiac surgery, his first love. It will also test Shetty’s ability to balance his social agenda — affordable surgeries for the poor — with investors’ expectations of reasonable returns.

Why an IPO NH treats more than 2 lakh in-patients and around 15 lakh out-patients annually, most of them from rural and underprivileged backgrounds. This was Shetty’s vision when he established NH, then Narayana Hrudayalaya, in the year 2000 to create a space for accessible, affordable healthcare.

Still, many of his anecdotes betrayed a restiveness. Yes, NH was the world’s largest low-cost hospital. “But did you know that India needs 20 lakh heart surgeries a year, but is capable of doing only around 1.2 lakh?”

“Mothers ask how much a surgery for their child will cost. I quote an amount. If they don’t have that much, they won’t get the operation. That’s what I do – that’s what all Indian doctors do – every day: put a price on a child’s life,” he said. The IPO will help NH build more hospitals to do more such surgeries cheaper.

Shetty’s son and senior vice-president Viren Shetty puts it pithily: “The IPO will enable us to be more us.” But the IPO will also bring the added responsibility of earning reasonable financial returns for shareholders.

Being a publicly listed company will open the low-cost hospital to the cycle of quarterly results and shareholder expectations and financial pressures that might compete with Shetty’s social goals.

Shetty himself was uncomfortable with it in the past. In a speech in June 2012, he had explained why his family candidly.


	 


“We are in business because we want to help the underprivileged and the cost of healthcare to come down. For that, I need the freedom.” At that time, his eccentric enterprise was funded by private investors JP Morgan and AIG, from whom they raised `200 crore each. In January 2015, UK-based CDC invested Rs 300 crore.

Then, Shetty kept his freedom and his private investors through standardisation and scale — investor speak for rationalising expenses and treating large numbers of poor people with the quality they deserve.

Shetty’s famously soft voice searched for a new phrase for his frequently quoted goal of ‘Walmartising’ healthcare, which he is now weary of. “Size for social impact, size for sustainability,” he finally said.

NH pursues economies of scale with a vengeance: it performs among the world’s largest number of heart surgeries, aggressively reduces costs through centralised purchases of supplies and innovates processes from billing to intensive care. NH does this in its 31 hospitals in 19 cities in India, and one in the Cayman Islands off the coast of the USA.

Walking through any NH campus is like seeing the wide gap between a government and private multi-specialty hospital close. Two floors below Shetty’s quiet office in the Bengaluru campus, the emergency ward teems with patients, nurses holding IVs, and doctors running soundlessly through hallways. A reed thin woman from Manipur sits under a tree near the cancer centre, breastfeeding her daughter — her husband was having surgery later that day.

It would cost her Rs 80,000, half of how much other private Indian hospitals charged. Another elderly woman from a village in Belgaum said her son was recovering from a bypass, paid in full by the microhealth-insurance scheme NH had pioneered for poor cooperative farmers in 2003 with the Karnataka government.

The Bengaluru hospital performs 49 surgeries a day, using specialists, high volume and technology to drastically reduce the time and cost of treatments. “How do we stay low-cost?” asked Shetty. “Because we’re big. Because we’re big, we can roll out the innovation across the hospitals. We can dictate terms in our purchases, we can maximise the use of expensive clinical equipment.”

While most hospitals use their infrastructure for around 8 hours, NH claims to use it for 12-14 hours a day. The average number of CT scans per machine in India is a maximum seven while in NH, Shetty said it is about 30. Since NH implants the largest number of heart valves in the world, valve manufacturing companies can sell their products at a lower cost to the hospital.

NH’s revenue in the latest available data for 2013-14 was Rs 1,072.68 crore, roughly a fifth of the biggest healthcare player Apollo’s and fourth of Fortis’. In the five years leading up to March 2014, however, NH’s income grew at a rate of 35%, ahead of Apollo and Fortis that grew at 18.7% and 29% respectively in the same period.

Volumes, cost cuts and tiered pricing have enabled NH to manage a net profit growth rate of 3.5% in the last five years kept a majority stake in the company. “We are eccentric people,” he had said (see Narayana Health vs...). “We make only a small margin compared to other big hospitals, but we are staying afloat treating a majority of poor patients for half the price,” said Shetty.

It’s All for the Mission A doctor from Manipal Hospital called NH “a temple for Devi Shetty”. Dozens of patients waited outside Shetty’s Bengaluru office, and an elderly man treated by NH’s senior oncologist used the word “darshan” when he said he wanted to catch a glimpse of Shetty before returning to his village. In Shetty’s defence, Vasuki, who has worked with Shetty for more than a decade, puts it down to “gratitude”.


	 


A few of Shetty’s detractors imply that it is the personal charm, not the hospital’s model that has opened doors for NH and smoothened expansion. In a blog post on June 9, 2012, Mumbai-based Dr Aniruddha Malpani, a popular infertility specialist, disparaged Shetty as “healthcare’s blue-eyed boy… unlikely to ever be critically analysed”. He also writes that Shetty has “political clout”.

Indeed, the doctor is friendly with Karnataka’s senior Congress leaders, the most well-known relationship being that with SM Krishna, who was chief minister when NH opened its first hospital off Bengaluru and set up the micro-health insurance scheme with the Karnataka government.

NH has also provided free primary health services since 2005 in 15 blocks of Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli and Amethi, constituencies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. In 2012 in Ahmedabad, the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi provided land for and inaugurated NH’s multispecialty hospital.

Now, Shetty continues to meet prime minister Modi as the secretary of the Association of Health Providers India. The connections give NH access to cheap land, trimming a large component of building a hospital.

It has helped NH grow not only in Karnataka and Gujarat, but also Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Assam.

Public-private partnerships like microhealth insurance and low-cost care centres also help displace the cost by getting the state, instead of the patient or NH, to foot part of the bill. While the harshest critics imply favouritism, no one suggests foul play.

Shetty’s healthcare visionary persona also seems to attract young, passionate healthcare professionals to the hospital. Like Dr Arvind Ranganathan in the first floor cardiac ICU, who is setting up iKare, a point-of-care app created by NH and IT Services firm Cognizant to centrally record and monitor patient vitals.

Or the Bengali-speaking young office manager Rajeev Yadav, who helped When Dr Ranganathan spoke of coming to NH after spending years in the US with healthcare startups, and Yadav of growing up poor in Kolkata wondering if he could ever afford to do social work, they glowed with the same sense of purpose.

Both seemed to believe Shetty had picked them personally for the job. Undeniably, Shetty’s surgical-outfit wearing, kindly, always accessible image has swayed private investors, suppliers, governments and healthcare professionals to back his unconventional ideas.

The public shareholder is the new frontier. The global praise for NH’s business model, and its ever-expanding existence has encouraged many small healthcare ventures across the country to scale up.

Low-cost care, smarter diagnosis, and India-proof medical technology are now funded by a growing cluster of impact investors – those who invest in companies with social goals. “In the last 10 years, the availability for funding in healthcare has exploded, and many are not charitybased, but for-profit models,” said Ashwin Naik, founder of Vaatsalya Healthcare, which sets up low-cost hospitals in small towns.

A PwC report said the average investment size by private equity funds in healthcare had increased from US$5-15 million to US$ 20-30 million, most of it in diagnostic centres and hospital chains. It is significant why NH chose an IPO at this juncture.

“The immediate reasons are that Narayana’s current investors are looking for an exit,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Dr Shetty’s friend, co-promoter, neighbour and Biocon founder, who runs the cancer centre in NH. “Some of the capital raised will be used to pay off debts to them. The rest will help Devi’s model reach even more people.”

Viren described it as a moment to tackle “the new problem of scale”. “We have solved the problem of cost. Now it’s about more land, more buildings, more technology, more doctors, more patients.” Today, NH has 6655 beds in all, but Shetty has always said his dream was 30,000 beds by 2020.

“To achieve that kind of size, you can’t but go to the market,” Shaw said. Size can be the reason for the IPO, but could the IPO shake the social-commercial balance of NH? Public investors might demand a greater returns, challenging NH’s working equation of social good and financial returns.

In recent years, for instance, the company has not paid any dividends, even if, with a majority stake, Shetty’s family would have stood to gain the most. It is a testament to the model’s intention of funnelling all gains into the social goal, but such a decision might not be as easy when public shareholders are involved.

Roopa Kudva, managing director of impact investor Omidyar Network, disagrees. Financial pressures are “constructive” for social businesses, said Kudva, also the former MD and CEO of ratings agency Crisil. “From businesses with social goals, investors would expect discipline, not unreasonable profit.”

Amit Bhatia, CEO of Impact Investors Council believes the NH IPO will be “a path-breaking one”, providing evidence that “businesses can do good and still be responsible in terms of economics.”

Viren Shetty argues that the vision was never constrained by having forprofit investors in the past, and the challenges with going public could be no less than before. “NH has never been flush with profits. Investors, private or public, know what we stand for when they put their money in it,” he says.

The senior Shetty is less direct. A few times in the interview, he asked this one question, in different ways: “Who says a for-profit hospital cannot achieve social impact, and do it for 20, 30, 40 years?”

Now he has to convince investors.

"HUL needs to up the game to sustain growth, emerge favourite among investors",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hul-needs-to-up-the-game-to-sustain-growth-emerge-favourite-among-investors/articleshow/8212914.cms,m.economictimes.com,"HUL needs to up the game to sustain growth, emerge favourite among investors","
  A third consecutive quarter of a double-digit growth in revenues, driven largely by volume growth indicates a turnaround for HUL, which has had a stunted growth from 2009 till mid-2010. Efforts mounted by the company over the past few quarters now appear to be bearing fruit for the FMCG company. More than 50% of its product portfolio has either been relaunched or rebranded. 
  
  It has increased its coverage to 5,000 more stores — most of them in rural areas. A volume growth of 13.5%, in spite of past year’s high base in the face of an intense competition, looks impressive. Operating profit, which rose 9%, was largely impacted due to high input cost. 
  
  Selective product price increases and a calibrated adspend could not help the company boost operating profit margins. While the MNC consumer giant has successfully managed to defend its leadership across categories, the moot point is how much of this is sustainable in a high inflation scenario and growing competition from national and regional players as well as other multinational companies. In 2010, the company was seeking to push up volumes through price cuts and discounts on products. 
  
  This year, it has changed the tack and is taking price increases on products back to year-ago levels. The company has indicated that the mix of price and volume growth is likely to change since increase in prices may put pressure on volume growth. Investments in brands given competition and higher input cost inflation are two cost heads for FMCG firms. 
  
  For HUL, addressing this ought not be tough, considering its deep pockets. It will need to adjust adspends and brand equity to pass on input costs to consumers. However, soaps and detergents , the largest revenue-earner segment for HUL, continues to be a sore point for the company. This category is marked by competition, rising raw material prices and a slowdown in consumer demand. HUL appears to have adopted a wait and watch approach to gauge consumer behaviour in this category. 
  
  One of the few FMCG stocks to have declined since the start of 2011, HUL’s stock has now fallen 9%. With its performance back on track, the company’s stock, which is now trading at a price to earnings multiple of 27 and a dividend yield of 2.3%, looks attractive among FMCG stocks. 
  
  The markets appear to have recognised that with the stock surging 3.5% on Monday after the results. However, given the current macro economic scenario, HUL will have to up its game to sustain this performance, if it has to emerge as a favourite among investors again.

Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) is said to be launching its tax-free bond issue worth Rs 4,532 crore on December 8. 

 It is about 6.5 times the size of earlier issues of tax free bonds from NTPC, PFC and REC, which were of Rs700 crore each. Retail investors got meagre allotment in the earlier issuances due to the smaller size though 40% of the issue size was reserved for them .Typically those who applied for Rs1 lakh, got allotment worth Rs 12,000-15,000 due to heavy subscription. 

 Being a big issue, the chances of allotment in IRFC are higher. Distributors are urging investors to apply for a slightly higher amount to get their quota. “The issue size from IRFC is six times more than that of the earlier issues. 

 Interest rates on offer are also marginally higher,” says Jyotheesh Kumar, Senior Vice-President, HDFC Securities. These tax-free bonds will have three tenures — 10 years, 15 years and 20 years. The 10-year bonds for retail investors will carry 7.32%, 15-year bonds will offer 7.53%, while the 20-year bonds will offer 7.5%. 

 “If investors, want an allotment of Rs 5 lakh, they would do well to apply for about Rs8 lakh as we expect a 50-60% oversubscription in this issue as well,” says Rupesh Bhansali, Head (Distribution), GEPL Capital. High networth individuals, who typically make applications for over Rs10 lakh, could also look at splitting applications. 

 Investors, who want allotment of up to Rs40 lakh, could consider splitting applications across family members of Rs10 lakh each for their applications to be considered in the retail category. This also helps in getting a higher interest as the retail category carries a 0.25% higher interest as compared to the HNI category.

 ET Now: Is it a good time now to revisit some of those exporters because it is highly unlikely that Reserve Bank of India will allow rupee to appreciate quite dramatically? Because if the rupee appreciates, it will automatically challenge all the economic recovery. CAD problems will come to the fore and exporters will rendered extremely uncompetitive. What is your take on this?
 
 Prateek Agarwal: Yes, I would agree with you completely. The rupee has really appreciated to a level higher than was warranted. Policymakers themselves have been saying so. I thought they were comfortable when the rupee was at 60-61 kind of a band.
 
 It is vital for the economy that rupee stabilises at whatever level it touches. That alone can help people plan and export and grow. Extreme high degree of volatility in the rupee on the stronger side helps the market, but may not be good for the economy.
 
 We have seen what happened in the past when the rupee appreciated very sharply to 40. For some time, we had run a current account surplus but after that, the deficit became extremely huge. So, I am of the view that the rupee needs to stabilise. It should stabilise at current levels.
 
 After the sharp run-up in other parts of the market, exporters have been doing well. Markets have given them a miss. Perhaps it is time in terms of even sector rotation that the market looked at that pack.

Manoj Vaish new CEO of MCX; bourse to trim stake by January 18,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/manoj-vaish-new-ceo-of-mcx-bourse-to-trim-stake-by-january-18/articleshow/28299050.cms,m.economictimes.com,Manoj Vaish new CEO of MCX; bourse to trim stake by January 18,"MUMBAI: The bankers-dominated selection committee of the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) today elected Manoj Vaish as the new managing director and CEO of the exchange that is under the regulatory glare following troubles at the promoter group. 

 The regulator FMC had late last month said the promoter Jignesh Shah and the promoter group Financial Technologies were not ""fit and proper"" to run not only the crippled NSEL but also MCX and any other exchange in the country. 

 After a marathon board meet that lasted over six hours today, the new MCX board, comprising representatives of various banks, selected Manoj Vaish, who at present is the managing director of NSDL Database Management. 

 Vaish was an executive director of the BSE between 1998 and 2004 and CEO of financial services research firm Dun & Bradsheet. 

 The board interviewed seven candidates and three were shortlisted -- Dilip Bhatia, CEO of Ace Commodities Exchange; Anil Mishra, managing director and CEO of National Multi-Commodity Exchange and Manoj Vaish, sources said. 

 The interviews were conducted after Shreekant Javalgekar stepped down as the MD and CEO of MCX following the Rs 5,600-crore scam at its sister concern the National Spot Exchange (NSEL), co-promoted by MCX promoter Financial Technologies, in late July. 

 More than 70 people had applied for the top job at MCX, including two exchange insiders, a former National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) chief and officials of Reliance Commodities, IFCI, Central Depository Services and NSDL Database Management, sources said. 

 While Satyanand Mishra was appointed MCX chairman late last year, the selection of the new MD was important as FTIL promoter has already been declared as not fit and proper to run the exchange. 

 The board was also expected to consider FTIL and MCX stake dilution in MCX-SX, as per Sebi order. But nothing could be confirmed regarding this. 

 FTIL holds 26 per cent stake in MCX, which FMC had asked them to be brought down to 2 per cent. The board meeting however, decided to trim the promoters' stake to 5 per cent by January 18, according to sources.

"Metal stocks shine after price hike, but experts are giving a dull outlook",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/steel-and-metal-stocks-are-a-sell-on-rise-for-me-dhananjay-sinha/articleshow/94470217.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steel and metal stocks are a sell-on-rise for me: Dhananjay Sinha,"“The metal space actually did very well last year, from an Indian player standpoint they benefited a lot through a large amount of exports and stuff. Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel,” says Dhananjay Sinha, Director & Head of Strategy Research and Chief Economist, Systematix Shares and Stock

What is your view on the long-term trajectory for IT? The IT pack has undergone a considerable correction. Over the last year, the IT sector has been the worst performing after a very good run. So the IT sector has come down quite a bit and it has absorbed a lot of negative news. The key concern out here is with respect to the impending recession and the slowdown in the US and Europe. 
 
People have raised concern about their sales growth, etc. As of now, the IT companies, be it largecaps or midcaps, have not really sounded alarm with respect to their outlook. They appear to be fairly resilient. But the market is concerned about the outlook with respect to revenue growth. Of course, there is an issue with respect to margins. which is largely a factor of the boom that we saw last year.
 
That is broadly in the price but on a relative basis, the valuations have come down quite a bit. Large names have corrected from a PE valuation with a forward standpoint from something like 30-34 levels to currently about 24-23 levels. It has come down. There is still some amount of downside in valuation that is there. So maybe a 5-10% downside is possible but it is approaching a value zone as far as the IT sector is concerned. One should look at the largecaps.
 

How would you approach metals now given that on one side, there is a demand challenge and on the other side, there is a recession fear?With respect to metals, I have been an underweight for the last one year. We are looking at deceleration in the manufacturing sector across the world. If you look at the PMIs in developed markets, in Europe, the US and China, there has been significant deceleration and a marked contraction as well in major countries.
 
So the demand for metal is likely to be under pressure. If you look at various markets, there has been almost like a 40-50% correction in steel prices. Also with respect to aluminium, zinc, etc, there has been a considerable contraction. So I think metal space actually did very well last year, from an Indian player standpoint they benefited a lot through a large amount of exports and stuff. Right now what is happening is that since the prices have corrected we have imposed a 15% export duty on steel. There is a glut in the domestic market and we are seeing that steel imports are also happening from China. 
 
There is intense competition and I have been a sell on steel and metal companies. I would continue to be so going forward because when central banks the world over are fighting inflation, commodities would not do well. For me, commodities in general and metals are underweight. So on any rise in steel and other metal stocks, I would sell.


The big macro concern, what is happening to the pound? How is the UK economy becoming topsy-turvy? What happens to companies which are dependent on the UK like Mastek, HCL Tech, TCS, Tata Motors?What we have to really put into context is that post Covid, Indian manufacturers actually enjoyed quite a bit of export exposure, especially given the context that there were fairly tight supply issues in the US, Europe and UK. There was a huge amount of fiscal stimulus. The volume growth for Indian manufacturers actually went up disproportionately.
 
ET Now: How would you view a business like Paytm? Purely the business, forget where the stock is headed?
Dhananjay Sinha: I think the Paytm business may do well. The best of volume growth is behind us, given the digitisation theme that was evident post Covid. A lot of that was being valued. Going forward, is this going to repeat the kind of buoyancy that we have seen earlier? I do not think so. Increasingly, the business model will have to be a function of what it does through the transactions, the buffer that it creates through transactions etc.
 
There are limitations with respect to what it can do. There are financial regulations that it will be subject to. So value creation from here on can be very limited.


What do you want to buy in a market decline?The risk of the market being on the downside is definitely there. We are looking at earnings cuts. In the first quarter, we have seen a 3.5% cut for Nifty earnings. We are looking at something like a 15% odd cut for the full year. So there is a downside as far as the market is concerned.
 
Secondly, given the context that the risk free rate is actually rising and more rate hikes will happen, the valuations might also be a challenge. Overall it would be relevant to be more defensive as far as the market is concerned. High beta sector such as metals, capital goods, industrials, mid and smallcaps are the things that will be relatively lower in my pecking order. 
 
I have been somewhat positive on urban consumption themes in autos, discretionary. Staples has done well, ITC continues to be a good value stock and continues to do well. Autos have done phenomenally well. Over the last year, I have reduced some overweight there. 
 
I would say that I am looking at pharma stocks at this juncture. There is a reasonable amount of visibility as far as the earnings are concerned and there are certain stocks which are available at good value and the sector has not done much over the last one year it comes at a good value. Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr Reddy, Ajanta and Indoco Remedies are some of the stocks that have come from our sort of pick. That is broadly the profile of things that we have in our portfolio.
 

Would you bet into oil consumers like Indigo?One should be looking at something like Asian Paints or Berger Paints because they have oil intermediates as inputs. They have a monopolistic market presence and pricing power etc. One should really look at such things. Asian Paints is something that I like in terms of valuations. Also, if you look at the market cap to sales ratio, what I look for has come down quite a bit over the last six odd months. 
 
So one would rarely get a chance in 20-30 years when we may see a sharp correction in such stocks. Any correction out here should be bought I would say so that is what you know I would play this oil with actually.

Kothari replaces SAIL chief C S Verma, who held the additional charge of CMD NMDC. 

 Earlier, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) has chosen Narendra Kothari, CEO of SAIL's Burnpur plant for the post of NMDC's CMD. NMDC, the country's largest iron ore miner, had been without a full-time chairman after retirement of its regular head Rana Som on December 31, 2011. 

 ""The Government of India has appointed Shri Narendra Kothari, CEO, SAIL as CMD on the Board of NMDC for a period of five years with effect from the date of assumption of charge of the post or till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier,"" NMDC said in a filing to the BSE. 

 In terms of the government order, Kothari has ""assumed charge of the post of CMD of NMDC on April 21, 2014,"" the miner said. It added that consequent to the development, Verma ceases to be CMD and Director of the Company with effect from April 21, 2014. 

 The Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had in July 2011 suggested the name of M S Rana, CMD, Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India, for the post. But, the Steel Ministry was not in concurrence with the PESB's recommendation and instead gave company's Technical Director N K Nanda additional charge. 

 Following some issues that cropped up, SAIL Chief C S Verma was given the additional task and he continued at the helm of affairs of the country's top iron ore producer. Later, a panel headed by Planning Commission Member Arun Maira, recommended two candidates for the top job - Narendra Kothari and T K Lahiry, CMD of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd in May last year. NMDC produced 30.18 million tonnes (MT) iron ore in last fiscal and sold 30.50 MT of the key steel-making raw material.

  Paras Adenwala, MD & Principal Portfolio Manager, Capital Portfolio Advisors in a chat with ET Now talks about telecom stocks.
  
  
  Do you really sense that perhaps on a long-term basis while right now fair enough the telecom balance sheets are looking overstretched but with 3G because that has higher efficiency than the current 2G? Your BWA can be used for WiMAX as well and be used for 4G. On a long-term basis, do you see a whole lot of value accretion? 
  
  Yes, absolutely. Now the telecom companies would have to really focus on the value-added services as opposed to pure volume gain that they have been used to in the past and, therefore, there is tremendous amount of innovation that these people can do and keep on improving the margins, so once this competitive pressure eases out, it has already begun to ease out. 
  
  Once it settles down and the balance sheet also starts improving, that would be a time to really get back into some of the leading names and stay invested for the long term.

ET Now: Do you think the secular rally in cyclicals is now coming to an end, and cyclicals in general are getting slightly exhausted? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: This has been our long-held view. I can give you some numbers for your convenience. Take two of the most expensive stocks in, let us say, a sector like FMCG, which most commentators will say is a very expensive sector. Take two of the very high-quality MNC names in the capital goods space. Have an optimistic projection for capital goods by which I mean 15% plus kind of sales growth, margins which are way higher than the current margins and average margins. Then look at what kind of profits are arrived at and what kind of valuation they trade versus FMCG. 

 So, if you compare the two you would find the FMCG story to be much more compelling. I am in no way saying that it is cheap. Actually the so called defensive part of the market today trades cheaper than the cyclical part of the market. Pharmaceuticals are valued very nicely, IT is cheap while growth there may be an issue. Sectors like capital goods and public sector banks are trading at valuations which will probably make these sectors — in the best case scenario — move sideways for some length of time.

ET Now: What do you do with infra, stocks like IDFC and couple of other infra finances have corrected a quite a bit, still stay away from them? 

 
Sonam Udasi: No, it really depends on what is your perspective on the market. Our perspective is that in the near term despite what we have seen today, there is not much scope for you to rally further, you can do a 100 points here or there that said with the currency where it is and you are heading into an election year, despite the trade deficit coming where it is, it is likely that it will be perking up in July and August as well and as investors realise that if dollar is to stay here, they will look at gold positively. 

 If you cannot do dollar then gold is a natural hedge against the dollar in that sense so I suspect that with that view in mind in the near term the pressure will continue on IDFC. You will see bouts of buying and selling. But if you have a longer view, say 1-1/2 year kind of view, these valuations on IDFC and some of the stocks like BOB, PNB, you will only find when they are under stress and once that starts to clear out which I suspect will happen over six to eight months from now. Then that is real investment. But for now, you could probably buy IDFC after seven days again at the similar price which was yesterday.

UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/upa-takes-sheen-off-psu-stocks-since-it-came-to-power-in-2004/articleshow/29540056.cms,m.economictimes.com,UPA takes sheen off PSU stocks since it came to power in 2004,"The government’s family jewels have lost some of their sheen in the past 10 years. Shares of state-run companies have underperformed the broader market since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power in 2004, an ET Intelligence Group analysts shows. That comes after the PSU index outpaced the BSE Sensex by a huge margin during 1999-2004, when the BJP was heading the ruling coalition.
 
 The PSU index rose 60 per cent in the first term of the UPA, whereas the Sensex rose at double that pace during those five years starting 2004. Under UPA-II, the PSU index lost 6 per cent so far, compared with a 73 per cent gain in the benchmark.
 
 During the NDA rule, the PSU index that exists since February 1999 jumped more than 300 per cent, compared with a 70 per cent gain in the benchmark index. Base effect played a part in these comparisons, but there were other reasons as well that influenced the performance of PSU stocks during the UPA and NDA rules, an analyst said.
 
 ""The outperformance of PSUs starting 1999 was on the background of a severe industrial slowdown that had led a large number of companies into distress,"" said Phani Sekhar, fund manager of portfolio management services at Angel Broking.
 
 For instance, he said, the shares of Steel Authority of India were trading below their face value and banks were grappling with very high non-performing assets at that time, so ""a part of their subsequent out-performance was on a lower base"". However, he said, the NDA government also had a stated privatisation policy and it carried out privatisations of companies such as Hindustan Zinc and Maruti Suzuki, making PSUs lucrative for investors.
 
 ""This, along with improving GDP growth, helped PSUs to outperform."" Under the UPA’s first term, the department of disinvestment was closed down, he said. ""Environmental issues and policy flip-flops impacted investor perception towards PSUs, which were already richly priced.
 
 In the last couple of years, FPO (follow-up public offer) announcements destroyed valuations due to lack of buying appetite,"" Sekhar added. The BSE PSU index currently comprises 59 shares with Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Coal India , State Bank of India, NTPC and NMDC representing the top five constituents.
 
 Unlike other indices, which consider free-float market capitalisation of the constituents, the BSE-PSU index is based on full market capitalisation of its constituents and consists of PSUs from the BSE500 group. The data analysed by ETIG exclude those of banks due to their different reporting structure, and companies such as Coal India, Oil India and NHPC, which got listed mid way.
 
 
 As the data suggest, the last five years under the UPA-2 have been particularly bad for PSUs, although the government kept selling more shares in these companies in a bid to tide over a burgeoning fiscal deficit. The financials of these PSUs have also shown a steady decline in the second term of the UPA.
 
 Total return on equity and return on capital have shown a steady year-on-year decline from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2013. ""This is because the government did not create a regulatory environment suitable for doing business,"" blamed Sankaran Naren, chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential.
 
 Currently, they are a good value buy, but there is always the government risk existing in these stocks, he added. The return on equity and return on capital employed are important ratios that capture the amount of profits generated by a corporate per unit of investment made in it. Higher the ratio, the better. The price-to-book value of these companies has fallen to 1.2 now from 2 in 2009.
 
 In fact, the market values of a few companies such as SAIL, Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil and Nalco have dropped below their book value. Book value is the total net worth of a company and is calculated by adding reserves and surplus to the share capital. PSUs’ growing debt levels were another key factor making investors nervous.
 
 The debt of 53 listed PSUs — net of cash and bank balance — jumped over three-fold to Rs 2.64 lakh crore at the end of March 2013 from Rs 85,000 crore at the end of fiscal 2009. The biggest debt amassers were from two important industries — petroleum and power — which have seen policy-led impediments.
 
 Indian Oil, BPCL, HPCL, Power Grid and NTPC together held Rs 2.82 lakh crore net debt at end-March , more than doubled since fiscal 2009. On the other extreme, the top five cash-rich PSUs witnessed 80 per cent growth in their idle cash position between FY09 and FY13. It were the remaining 43 PSUs that witnessed a spurt in indebtedness, from less than Rs 1,500 crore in FY09 to Rs 86,000 crore in FY13.
 
 The most notable names turning from cashrich to highly indebted in this period include SAIL, Shipping Corporation and MTNL. This doesn’t mean the lot will continue to under-perform. ""Health-wise , the PSUs are much better placed today compared with 1998-99 ,"" said Angel’s Sekhar. ""It is regrettable that they are underperforming their potential. Given some policy clarity, they have the potential to out-perform once again.""

Five reasons why you should wait and watch,"NEW DELHI: The appointment of Vishal Sikka as the CEO and MD of India’s second largest software exporter has come as a fresh ray of light for the investors of Infosys as it clears the underlying uncertainty, but it will be a long haul before any meaningful recovery can be seen in the stock.

Infosys, which wore the tag of IT bellwether some time back, is now struggling to regain confidence of its investors. India’s second largest IT exporting company has been witnessing a tepid growth in sales and profits since the past four years.

The stock has plunged a little over 18 per cent from its peak of Rs 3847.20 recorded on 3 March 2014, marred by a series of senior level exits and slowdown in sales. On YTD basis, Infosys is down a little over 9 per cent, as of data collected on 11 June.

""Vishal Sikka will be the next CEO of Infosys. This could likely be a long haul even if he’s the right man for the jog,"" said JP Morgan in a report. Even if he is the right man for the CEO job at Infosys, time will only say so. We believe this might be a really long haul for both Dr. Sikka and Infosys, added the report.

Vishal Sikka, a former SAP AG executive board member, was on Thursday appointed as Infosys’ Chief Executive Officer and MD. With his appointment, Sikka becomes the first non-founder CEO of Infosys.

The company also announced that Executive Chairman NR Narayana Murthy and Executive Vice Chairman S Gopalakrishnan would step down on June 14. Rohan Murty will also leave the company on June 14.

We have collated five possible reasons why Infosys will remain subdued in the short term, but remains a good long-term bet:

Building the right team: The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock at least for the time being and building the right team will be most important task in light of the recent senior-level exits. Infosys is a more of service-led company and Vishal Sikka comes from a product background, which is very different from the services business.

""Rebuilding the team will be a major challenge for him since the core team has left the company. Vishal has to build his own team and that is very important because one person cannot change a large company like Infosys,"" said Former Infosys Board Member V Balakrishnan.

""He also has to quickly connect with the clients and give them comfort, because clients have been worried since the leadership transition took a long time,"" he added.

Balakrishnan is of the view that Vishal, with his pedigree, looks like the right person for this role, but the jury is still not out on whether he will be able to perform to his full potential.

In light of the recent top-level exits, Mr. Sikka’s first job would be to comfort the people and tell them that the company has faith in them despite the bad stretch. The challenge is to get the people believe in themselves and that they are for keeps.


	 

""This is the turning point for the company and calls for re-rating of the stock. However, the board also needs to get reconstituted in a manner that it has more independent ‘directors’ than what it has had at this point of time,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Consulting.

""The same board is not going to fix the problem, even if the CEO is different. Once you get the ghost out of the closet completely, you will find this company flying again,"" he added.



Brokerages are positive despite near-term concerns: 

Despite recent exits, most brokerage firms are positive on the stock and have a target price of Rs 3500-4000 for a period of the next 12 months.

Earlier in the month of June, Prasad Thrikutam, the global head for sales and marketing at Infosys, resigned from the company. Thrikutam’s exit came a week after Infosys President and CEO-hopeful BG Srinivas resigned and was the 12th senior-level exit after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to the company as the executive chairman last June.



				


JP Morgan has an ‘overweight’ rating on the stock and a target price of Rs 4000 by March 2015. Infosys appears to have more realistic targets in the current environment, which we believe is positive.

Their price target is based on a one-year forward P/E of 16.5x, at a modest (15%) discount to TCS’ target multiple of 19.0x. They believe that the discount is justified as TCS’ revenue growth and margin profile are better than that of Infosys.

IndiaNivesh is of the view that the stock is trading at 14.8x FY15E and 12.9x FY16E earnings estimates. Given the stable global environment, they are of the view that Infosys FY15 guidance is a bit on the conservative side. Hence they expect the upward revision in the guidance going ahead.

The brokerage firm has a 'BUY' rating on the stock with a target price to Rs.3,952 (valuing at 16.4x FY16E EPS).

May lead to more senior-level exits:

Infosys had been evaluating internal candidates for the CEO position as well and appointment of Dr. Sikka might drive another wave of resignation from the internal CEO hopefuls. So, the biggest challenge for Infosys will be of retaining talent.

However, the organization will likely stabilize after that, say experts. JP Morgan is of the view that Mr. Murthy’s stepping down should provide significant freedom to Dr. Sikka to rebuild the organization as per his vision.

Ankit Pandey of Quant Broking is of the view that there is still some uncertainty that will remain over the next three to four months. More people may decide to leave, he added.

""But there needs to be more hiring as well, especially because they have lost so many people at the top,"" added Pandey. So over the next six to nine months, there will be a lot of travelling, a lot of meeting with the clients and getting to know the company as a whole,"" he explained.


	 

Slowdown in growth likely to continue:

The announcement of the new CEO could lead to restoration of investor confidence into the stock for the time being, but revival in growth will take its time.

Although Dr. Sikka would bring in fresh thinking to the organization as a technology visionary, but being an outsider he would likely take time to figure out Infosys’ issues, culture, ways of working, politics, competitive landscape, onerous task of rebuilding a team - all of which will take time to show results. JpMorgan believes that Infosys’ expected recovery to industry-level revenue growth by FY16E will likely get pushed out further (maybe to FY17E or even beyond). All in all, they believe the company will take a longer-than-earlier expected time to get back to the respectable growth trajectory.

Apart from his valuable experience at SAP, Mr. Sikka will bring along his entrepreneur like visibility and proven success in tough global markets to the company.

""Although under his helm, Infosys may witness an improvement in performance through transition of activities, we believe that it may take time for the company to return to its growth trajectory,"" Microsec Capital said in a report.

""For the stock, the development is expected to remain positive in the near to medium term. However, the long term movement of the stock will continue to be determined by Infosys performance and improvement checkpoints in the quarters to come,"" added the report.

Sikka will be instrumental in boosting sales:

The appointment of Dr. Vishal Sikka's as the CEO and MD (designate) of Infosys is a positive development for the company and being a former SAP AG board member, analysts and industry experts expect him help the company win business from his former customers at SAP.

He will bring an innovation focus to the former IT industry bellwether, at a time when the industry is undergoing fundamental changes, ET reported.

In addition, his strong client relationships can help Infosys win business with new and old customers and improve revenue growth, Deutsche Bank said in a report. However, with his products background, we are concerned about Mr. Sikka’s ability to run a services company, it said.

Investors will now seek direction and clarifications from the new management on addressing issues of (a) high attrition, especially in sales, (b) loss of business and strategic vendor status from existing customers impacting revenue growth and (c) below par presence and acceptance in key growth market continental Europe, added the Deutsche Bank report.

"AirAsia offers 2 mn cheap tickets, fly from Kolkata to Bangkok for Rs 3,300",neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/airasia-offers-two-million-cheap-tickets-to-south-east-asian-cities/articleshow/19325703.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,AirAsia offers two million cheap tickets to South East Asian cities,"NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of its India entry, Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia has opened bookings for two million seats between April 2 and 7, 2013 offering air tickets as cheap as Rs 3,300 to South East Asian destinations for travel next year.

One can fly from Kolkata to Bangkok for all-in-fare of Rs 3,300, Chennai to Bangkok for Rs 3,500, Bangalore to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 5,500 , Kolkata to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 5000, Kochi or Chennai to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 4500 and from Tiruchirapalli to Kuala Lumpur for Rs 4000, a statement by the budget carrier on Monday said.

“We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns in such a scale. It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” Siegtraund Teh, Group Chief Commercial Officer of AirAsia said.

“Free seats to domestic Malaysia destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru, Terengganu and more are also available from Kuala Lumpur . Only taxes and fees apply to these free seats, which will be available from INR 0 one way,” the statement added.

These tickets can be booked for a travel period of January 1–April 30, 2014, which, according to AirAsia officials is in line with the airline’s standard practise of encouraging advance bookings.

“This is a standard promotion offer all over the world for all routes and nothing to do with India entry as we may enter even before January next,” a company official said, declining to be named.


				

	
	The official also said that their offer was different from the one recently offered by Tiger Airways.
	
	In March, Singapore-based Tiger Airways opened a promotional offer for tickets to Singapore from Chennai, Kochi, Bangalore, Hyderabad Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchirapalli at $50 (Rs 2700) for travel between May 1st and December 15th. The tickets will be on offer until March 13.
	
	The scheme, which offered 10 seats on each flight, was one to celebrate five years of its Indian operations.
	
	In an earlier story, ET had reported that AirAsia’s standard practise is to open seat bookings a few months in advance at a nominal price, going up to ten times that sum near the flight day.

	 

	The idea is to stimulate the market with low fares till a certain percentage of seats are filled and then go to the highest levels. This is standard AirAsia practise across its network in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Japan arms, which would be later replicated in India.
	
	AirAsia flies 186 routes, covering 85 destinations throughout 18 countries.
	
	“We have predicted a fare war in the next 12 months. This is a precursor. AirAsia is stimulating the market in the backdrop of their India entry. Even if they sell 1 million seats at say Rs 4,000, we are looking at an upfront cash collection of Rs400 crore, which can help fund their India plans.

	
	This may force other Indian carriers to follow suit since the January-April period typically sees limited tourism traffic,” said Amber Dubey, partner and head (aviation) at global consultancy KPMG. Jet Airways, India’s secondlargest airline by market share, and Air India did not respond to ET’s queries. 


	Last Wednesday, the government cleared AirAsia’s proposal to start a passenger airline in India in partnership with the Tata Group and Telstra Tradeplace’s Arun Bhatia, whose son is married to the daughter of NRI billionaire Lakshmi Mittal. AirAsia will hold 49% stake, Tata Sons 30% and Bhatia 21% in the new venture.
	
	Rajan Mehra, a former India head for Qatar Airways and the managing director (India) for Universal Aviation — a business aviation services provider, said most airlines float such offers when they enter a new market. 


	“Such an offer is the best bet to make people aware that a customer-friendly airline is coming to town. So, in a way, it is a backhanded way of advertising their product. This could cause a cascading effect (in terms of response from other airlines),” Mehra said.
	
	Himanshu Singh, managing director of online travel portal Travelocity, concurred with Mehra’s views on AirAsia’s seat sale, but doubted whether Indian airlines would respond to the offer. “Indian carriers are mature enough not to react to such discounts. 
	 

	Given that AirAsia is entering India with a long-term plan, they will sooner or later look to tap passengers through a hub & spoke model, like Spice-Jet, and would want to fly Indians out. This scheme may well be the groundwork for that,” Singh surmised. “We are the only airline in the region to constantly keep our fares low and offer free seats campaigns at such a scale. 


	It has now become an anticipated global virtual event and we will continue to stay true to our promise of ‘Now Everyone Can Fly’,” said Siegtraund Teh, group chief commercial officer of AirAsia. “Free seats to domestic Malaysian destinations such as Penang, Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru and Terengganu are also available from Kuala Lumpur.

ET Now: IT sector has disappointed a bit with results from IT biggies Wipro and HCL Technologies coming in a tad below market expectations. Now, it's Infosys, which is lined up for results on Friday. Do you think that the whole of IT pocket is now approaching the oversold territory? Will IT stocks see more downside or is the sector a structural short for some more months to come?
 
 
Ajay Bagga: IT firms may clock a growth of 12-15 per cent on the topline front; expect them to report a similar growth on the bottom line front. As far as margins are concerned, it seems that they do not have much scope for improvement at least in the next 12 months.
 
 Overall, the sector is getting rerated from a high-growth sector to a sector more like utility. Having said that, IT stocks will give you decent returns. There will be no negative surprises; IT firms have managements that are pro-minority shareholders. Looking at these factor , I would recommend investors to look at IT as a global play.
 
 An advisor to the RBI has recently said that rupee is overvalued. He said he would be happy if rupee drops to to 64-65 levels against the greenback.
 
 If this happens, then IT could be a good hedge for Indian investors. Consumers will lose purchasing power once rupee starts falling. Hence, keeping IT in your portfolio will help you.
 
 It is a natural hedge and it is a global growth story. So own IT stocks with that perspective, especially when domestic consumption is getting constraint the way it is. With the poor monsoon, the consumption space could be hurt even more. IT will give you some balance in the portfolio. Having said that, I do not expect them to be top performers.
 
 IT managements are clearly lacking inspirational wisdom. If you look at the US market, they give back $600 billion to shareholders every year via share buybacks. They pay $400 billion in dividends.
 
 If you are doing nothing and keeping surplus cash in fixed deposits or liquid funds at 8 per cent rate, then it is better give it back to the shareholders at least. Here, I am talking about domestic IT companies.

If one goes by the enthusiasm with which Rakesh Jhunjhunwala participated in the company's earnings conference call, it could well be his next Titan Industries.
 
 ""Sir, congratulations to you and your team on unbelievable results,'' said Jhunjhunwala. ""Is your better margins also reflecting the fact that you were utilising the same plants for higher production. Because, I've not seen any analyst report which highlights this, or no realisation of the fact that higher utilisation will give you much higher margins.""
 
 Jhunjhunwala, known as the Indian Buffett, follows some of the fundamentals of investing of Buffett, renowned for value-based investing. Buffett, the world's fourth richest man, stunned investors when he bought the rail company Burlington Santa Fe at the peak of 2008 credit crisis, when economies were contracting. But his bet proved talismanic with a boom in shale gas exploration making Burlington a money machine.
 
 Something similar could be in the making with Tata Motors, which is riding high on its pre-crisis acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover. The company though has been squeezed in the domestic economic slowdown, has been reporting record profits due to Jaguar Land Rover.
 
 Jhunjhunwala, who made a strong impression as a value investor with his ownership of Titan Industries and Crisil, has been favouring Tata Motors even as others were sceptical about the company’s ability to manage the JLR acquisition. Tata Steel, a group company, is still struggling after it acquired Corus Group in 2007.
 
 But it is altogether a different story at Tata Motors. The company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 4,805 crore, up 195%, as against a net profit of Rs 1,628 crore in the yearago period.
 
 A Jhunjhunwala questions also reflects his worry.
 
 “Are you not afraid that you’re going into too many segments, and your brand may be affected.” But the comforting management words were that both Jaguar and Range Rover vehicles will maintain their product appeal and the brand and the value they stand for.

 His role will be taken over by fund managers Harrish Zaveri, Rohit Singhania and Vinit Sambre. Shah went through a rough patch in 2013, when funds managed by him underperformed as he bet on an early economic recovery. Early bets on a recovery in sectors such as metals, oil and gas, infrastructure hurt performance. 

 Though the schemes bounced back in late-2014 and outperformed their benchmark indices, distributors were unhappy with the performance compared to the peers.Shah was criticised for aggressive churning of stocks in fund portfolios. A DSP Blackrock spokesperson declined to comment.

ET Now: What is the first stock on your radar? Why is it that you like this stock?
 
 
G Chokkalingam: We like Moil. The stock has been underperforming the market for more than four years. The reason for selecting the stock is that I believe that manganese ore prices have bottomed out post the recent correction. The company has got huge cash as well. The cash itself is 80 per cent of the market cap. With Rs 20 EPS for the current year, if profit grows at that rate - which are very likely - the core assets of the company would be free in the next 1-2 years.
 
 The current market mcap would be equivalent to the free cash itself. In addition, we saw some forecast coming in from Chinese Steel Association last week. It said the Chinese capacity is going to be shut for at least 20 per cent of the total capacity. So I believe that in next six months, the metal outlook particularly for steel industry would start improving. This would be positive for Moil. Aalso this company has increased its capacity in the last two years. It has got new mines in Maharashtra. All these point towards a robust outlook for Moil.

 In an official statement, NSPOT said the FCI witnessed a rapid increase in off-take of wheat within first three e-auctions conducted at its platform. 

 ""There has been a 76 per cent jump in the quantity of wheat sold to millers between August 7 and 21. The total quantity of wheat sold till now is 1.54 lakh tonnes,"" the company said. 

 Millers have bought wheat at prices ranging between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,836 per quintal, it said.

However, that is far from the case as the performance of the New York Stock Exchange-listed HDFC Bank ADR during this period shows. 

 Foreign investors have not been able to purchase the India-listed HDFC Bank’s stock as it has hit the limit of 49% for foreign institutional investors or FIIs. But while HDFC Bank’s stock closed at Rs 835.50 on Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday, its ADR closed with a premium of more than 17% at about Rs 981 (after conversion). As the accompanying chart shows, the gap has widened consistently over the past six months. 

 At the same time, foreign investors have also been buying HDFC Bank’s stock in the futures market that can be converted into cash position if the FII limit in the bank is raised. Average monthly open interest for HDFC Bank in the futures market has been consistently increasing month after month. It has tripled in the past six months, compared with an increase of 35% for ICICI Bank and 74% for Axis Bank. 

 “If the FII limit is hiked, all these positions will be converted into cash positions, which can result in huge buying in the stock,” said Viraj Gandhi, senior analyst with ICICI Direct. 

 The average open interest in HDFC Bank’s stock for July was 3.4 crore, compared to 1.1 crore in January, while the cash volume in July was just about 60 lakh.
 
 
 “The stock is very attractively priced and is consolidating due to technical reasons. Nobody is willing to wait for the final approval on the limit as this price may not be available then, hence the huge position built up in the derivatives market and in ADR,” said a US-based hedge fund manager, who did not wish to be identified. “If the limit is hiked the HDFC bank’s stock price and HDFC Bank’s ADR price should converge somewhere in between.” 

 HDFC Bank has proposed to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India for an increase in the FII limit to 74% from 49% currently. It is not clear, though, whether the parent HDFC’s 22% stake in the bank will be included in the overall holding of FIIs, who already own 77% of HDFC’s shares. A decision in favour of the bank, as many traders and analysts expect by September, will raise the limit for foreign investors. 

 HDFC Bank’s stock has remained range-bound in the past three months even as the benchmark BSE Sensex has gained 16% while its peers Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have given 30% and 17% returns respectively. 

 Analysts say that this trend could reverse in the coming months, with a possible increase in limit for FII holding, equity issuance and talks of merger with HDFC.

 The Forward Markets Commission (FMC), under the Finance Ministry, is functioning with less than 100 officers and staff against a sanctioned strength of 135. Vacant posts have not been filled due to poor responses to job advertisements. 

 To augment its manpower position for the discharge of regulatory functions, the FMC has posted an advertisement inviting applications for the engagement of 20 experts or professionals on contract basis. 

 FMC wants to hire six candidates each in the legal and inspection departments, two staffers in investigation and one each in monitoring and surveillance, cyber forensic, company secretary, statistician, human resources and information and communication technology, it said. 

 Experts and professionals would be recruited at various levels in Mumbai and Delhi. Initially, they would be recruited for one year, which can be extended as per requirements. The applicants should be below 60 years of age. 

 The government has received lukewarm responses to job advertisements posted regularly since 2005. Now that the workload has increased in the wake of the NSEL payment crisis, FMC has taken the contract route to recruit officers. 

 The regulator oversees the functioning of six national and 11 regional bourses in the country.

""We certainly see a turnaround time in 2013-14 fiscal subject to business condition,"" GMR Group Chief Financial Officer Amarthaluru Subbarao said. ""We expect fund raising to be completed over the next six to nine months,"" he said.

The Bangalore-based conglomerate has also embarked on an 'asset light and right strategy' for the future after having piled up net debt of Rs 33,600 crore.

It plans to raise around Rs 4,000 crore through stake sales by the end of current fiscal. This, along with higher earning from airport division after recent tariff revision, is expected to help GMR Infrastructure report profits next fiscal.

GMR Infrastructure, which operates India's largest airport in New Delhi, posted a consolidated net loss of 94 crore for the quarter ended June 2012, up from Rs 67 crore a year ago, due to higher tax paid by the company and losses incurred by Delhi airport and power divisions. The group plans to divest up to 21 per cent stake in GMR Infrastructure, which will bring down the promoter holding to 51 per cent. ""We do not have any specific target but we do not intend to go below 51 per cent at any point of time,"" Subbarao said. ""If we get appropriate price we will seriously consider the option. However, stake dilution will happen in tranches,"" he added.

The company's energy segment, which posted 156 per cent jump in its net loss at Rs 27 crore last quarter, is also scouting for investors to meet equity requirement of the ongoing power project and let private equity investors exit. The company requires Rs 1,500 crore equity to fund ongoing power projects over the next two year.

""We have an option of divesting up to 26 per cent at energy vertical through strategic investment, or bring investor at project level. We may also look at exiting projects like Island Power if required,"" Subbarao said.

GMR is also willing to divest up to 15 per cent stake in its Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils to a strategic investor.

The company is also in talks with investors to sell up to 74 per cent stake in its toll-based projects. Currently, road division contributes one-tenth of GMR's annual revenues. GMR Highways business has six toll- and four annuity-based projects either completed or under construction.

""NHAI allows us to divest majority stake at project level, if investors want controlling stake and meet our objectives we are open to hit,"" Subbarao said. ""We expect to raise up to Rs 1,500 crore through stake sale and will use it to meet equity requirement of Kishangarh-Udaipur-Ahmedabad road project,"" he added.

	 
Subbarao said the company is looking at asset light and right strategy for future projects. It now plans to pick up minority stake in infrastructure projects, run these for two-three years and exit with a premium. It may also look at owning majority stake in projects that have enough cash flow and do not require equity infusion.

GMR's debt has increased to Rs 32,900 crore in 2011-12 from Rs 3,700 crore five years earlier, according to a recent report by global financial service firm Credit Suisse.

Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gold-schemes-by-pm-modi-right-in-time-to-celebrate-dhanteras-d-k-aggarwal/articleshow/49697871.cms,m.economictimes.com,Gold schemes by PM Modi right in time to celebrate 'Dhanteras': D K Aggarwal,"By D K Aggarwal
 
 Apart from physical gold, this Dhanteras – the gold and silver buying festival – one can also avail the benefit of investing into the recently-launched three gold-related schemes, including India gold coin bearing the Ashok Chakra (available in denominations of 5 gm and 10 gm), gold monetisation, and sovereign gold bond.
 
 Importantly, instead of buying gold in physical form, investors can now park their money in bonds that are backed by gold. The idea behind launching gold monetisation schemes (GMS) is to tap household gold, which has been estimated to be of around 22,000 tonnes.
 
 Moreover, the recently-launched sovereign bond scheme would offer the same benefits as physical gold and can be used as collateral for loans and can also be traded on stock exchanges.
 
 At the time of selling, customers can earn returns as per the current price of gold. This scheme would help shift part of the estimated 300 tonnes of physical gold, which is purchased every year (in the form of gold bars and coins) in the country for investment.
 
 At the same time, it will relieve investors of the need to check the quality of gold and with valuation. Gold monetisation would help individual to earn up to 2.50 per cent interest rate on their idle gold. Investors can invest for medium term (between 5 and 7 years) as well as long term (12-15 years tenure).
 
 This initiative is likely to increase the productivity of the commercial banks as well as of the NBFCs. NBFCs are authorised to collect the application form and submit in banks and post offices.
 
 It is expected that with the launch of these schemes, India would be able to check its current account deficit (CAD). Actually, Indians are obsessed with the physical gold and India has suppressed China in case of its appetite for it. To note, India’s current account deficit stood a record $190 billion in 2013.
 
 This has prompted the then UPA government to hike import duty on it to a record 10 per cent. The efforts of government have helped India to import an estimated $34 billion of gold during the year 2014-15 much lesser then the previously imported.
 
 To note, India is the world’s top gold consumer. It is in 10th position among the top 10 countries that hold the most gold in their central banks; the Reserve Bank of India holds 557.7 tonnes of the precious metal.

Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/income-tax-department-lens-on-rs-5-lakh-crore-share-sales-by-india-inc/articleshow/34394326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Income tax department lens on Rs 5 lakh crore share sales by India Inc,"MUMBAI: More than 5,000 closely held companies will come under the glare of the income tax department for transferring funds through suspicious share-sale deals. According to information compiled by the tax office, about Rs 5 lakh crore changed hands in past six years as 26,000-odd unlisted firms belonging to large and mid-sized corporate houses transferred funds by issuing equity and preference shares at high premiums.
 
 Tax officers believe that as much as 25% of these transactions may not be genuine. They have come across deals where equity shares having a face value of Rs 1 were sold to another entity at a premium of Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 10 shares were issued at a premium of Rs 49 lakh, said a source aware of the ongoing I-T investigation.
 
 
Many share sale deals defy logic
 
 In two cases, involving the same corporate group, three shares of Rs 10 each were offered at a premium of more than Rs 100 crore a share. “There are many such deals that defy logic and it will be difficult for companies with little activity and capital of few lakhs to justify the premium,” said a government official.
 
 On April 25, ET had reported that the tax department, in a directive issued a day before the fiscal closing, questioned hundreds of companies on the premium collected against the sale of shares. The companies have been told to justify the premiums, failing which the amount would be treated as income and therefore taxed. The 26,000 cases relate to companies based in Maharashtra. More firms will be covered with the department’s offices in some of the northern states initiating similar procedures.
 

 Corporate groups often use their unlisted arms to enter into such transactions either to generate cash or convert unexplained cash into income. Say, entity A needs Rs 5 crore cash for a property deal or to arrange a payoff. While it has the money, it fears withdrawing the amount from bank would alert tax authorities. Instead, it strikes a deal with B, which has cash and is looking for a way to legitimise it. B issues shares to A, receives Rs 5 crore through official banking channels and pays A the amount in cash. Such deals are also used to
 
 bring back funds that may have earlier been siphoned out from a company. But three senior tax professionals ET spoke to said that such cases are unlikely to exceed 5% of total transactions. The department, according to them, has rattled many companies by putting a question mark on bona fide transactions such as issuance of shares to joint venture partners, promoters and financial investors.
 
 “Fewer shares with higher premium are also issued to keep the authorised capital low and reduce fees paid to the Registrar of Companies,” said one of the tax practitioners. The particular section in the law that empowers the department to demand taxes on unjustified premiums came into effect on April 1, 2013. But based on the Bombay High Court ruling in the case Major Metals Ltd versus Union of India, the department maintains that it has the power to tax cases related to unjustified premiums even prior to this date.
 
 According to the department, in a case where the share premium charged is in excess of their intrinsic valuation, there is ground for invoking the provisions of Section 68 of the Income-Tax Act, which requires the assessee to explain not only the ‘source’ of the credit entry but also its ‘nature’. The assessments that have been reopened pertain to those in 2008-09, which would have become time-barred after March 31, 2014. But the department is collecting data for subsequent years as well.

Infusion of additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders: Barclays,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/an-extra-1-trillion-to-indias-gdp-by-2020-makes-midcaps-hot-say-experts/articleshow/50090410.cms,m.economictimes.com,"An extra $1 trillion to India's GDP by 2020 makes midcaps hot, say experts","NEW DELHI: Consumption might become one of the biggest themes to track in the next 4-5 years, thanks to the government's reform push, feel experts. A renewed thrust to capital spending, they say, could add up to $1 trillion to India's GDP in the next 4-5 years.  	According to a report by Barclays, urban spending, reforms such as GST and government capital expenditure are all set to boost consumption.  	Midcaps are likely to benefit more out of the spending push.  	""The pay panel hike and One Rank One Pay (OROP) will aid consumer spend going forward, which could lead to infusion of an additional $1 trillion to India's GDP to create new midcap leaders,"" Barclays said.  	For minute-by-minute market/stock updates, follow our Twitter handle @ETMarkets  	The S&P BSE Midcap index rose over 4 per cent so far in 2015 compared to an over 7 per cent fall in the S&P BSE Sensex. Most of the midcaps stocks have pared gains but are still trading with gains of up to 70 per cent recorded in the last one year.  	Some of the midcaps that outperformed both Sensex, and BSE Midcap index include names such as Ashok Leyland (up 75%), Bajaj Finance (up 70%), 3M India (up 69%), Wockhardt (up 63%), and Britannia Industries (up 60%).  	""There are lot many opportunities in mid-cap space in various sectors, I am not denying that and these are completely bottom up opportunities in terms of sectors or in terms of companies themselves,"" said Parag Thakkar, Head-Institutional Sales, HDFC Securities.  	A large part of the success in the rally of midcap stocks can be attributed to domestic mutual funds that have poured in close to Rs 90,000 crore so far in the year 2015.  	According to the report, inflows in equity MFs in November stood at Rs 6,300 crore with AUM in the category rising by 1.5 per cent to a new high of Rs 4,03,000 crore.  	""If the trend continues of money coming into domestic funds, which have seen for the last 15 months or so then I suspect the mid-caps will continue to do well, because many of the mutual funds are quite adapt at finding the right ideas and putting money in mid-caps,"" said Sanjeev Prasad, Kotak Institutional Equities.  	""FPI investors typically look at large caps and as of now the indications are that you would not see too much of fresh money coming into emerging market funds but these things can always reverse,"" he added.  	While choosing which midcap stocks to invest, Prasad is of the view that investors should look buying stocks based on bottom-up analysis, and whether the stock price justifies the fundamentals at given point of time.  	Midcaps stocks usually perform well when economy is growing, and when public as well as private spending increases. But, additional funds up to $1trillion will certainly be beneficial for some of midcap names.  	Although, it is difficult to put a timeline as to when this amount of money will be come into India's GDP, but experts see it happening by the year 2020.  	""It will be difficult to precisely know when $1trillion will be added in the economy because of various developmental initiatives taken by the government, but by 2020 addition of $1 trillion looks achievable,"" said Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities.   	""Though, we believe pay commission effects will be just incremental as the payout this time will be staggered, but GST will bring in break through and cause far reaching changes in the economy.

ET Now: If the coal blocks are de-allocated, that will change the fortunes of JSPL. It became a power company only after 1992 when it got coal blocks for free. What are your thoughts on JSPL?  

 
Deven Choksey: It is possible that the de-allocation of JSPL could create disruption in their business. However, there is a possibility that instead of completely de-allocating and making the company suffer on the business front, they may probably go for the revised policy which may be an auction route in which the company may end up paying a little higher price but not asked to completely surrender the coal blocks. 

 Since we do not have clarity on this subject as yet, I would refrain from making any further comments on it. If the situation I mentioned earlier permits their economic value, it should not affect JSPL beyond a point.

At lower levels, maybe a 6400-6420 is the support and you can say broadly 6600 is the resistance so you could do this 200-point range for a bit and meanwhile individual stocks will do their thing so the idea here should be to look at the sector of the day and play stocks and the index may not do a whole lot.
 
 Meanwhile, on declines Bank Nifty should be bought, on rallies CNX IT should be sold so that is a broad idea you should have for trading but overall I do not see the market moving a whole lot in the next say 8-10 sessions.

Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/meera-sanyal-to-quit-royal-bank-of-scotland-for-a-full-time-career-in-politics/articleshow/19467763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Meera Sanyal to quit Royal Bank of Scotland for a full-time career in politics,"
	MUMBAI: Meera Sanyal, the 51-year old banker who stunned political observers and bankers alike by contesting the South Mumbai constituency against Milind Deora in 2009, is hanging up her boots to plunge into political life ahead of the forthcoming general elections.
	
	The daughter of late Vice Admiral G Hiranandani, a gallantry award winner and author of works on Indian naval history, will quit as the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, India, to involve in socio-political life full time, said two people familiar with the matter. It is not known whether Sanyal, a member of the Indian Liberal Group, would join any political party.
	
	Sanyal, a fan of Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, shot into fame when she filed nomination papers to contest against Deora, son of Congress politician and former minister of Petroleum Murli Deora. She lost the elections in 2009, but not the spirit. She got 10,157 votes, or about 1.6 per cent of the total polled. Deora won. She chose to contest elections following dismay at the response of the authorities to the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 which killed 164 people and set the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi on fire.
	
	Sanyal, who had said that she had given a quarter century of her life to banking, will give the next quarter century to political life, could not be reached for comment.
	
	“Meera H Sanyal is relinquishing her executive responsibilities as Country Executive, to devote herself more fully to the social, economic and political causes in India, that she is passionate about,” a statement from RBS said. “We are in the process of finalising an external successor for this role and will announce that person in due course.” Meera will continue to chair the India Services Executive Committee and the RBS India Foundation.
	
	Some in the industry welcome her decision to jump to political life. “It’s terrific,"" said said Jamal Mecklai, CEO, Mecklai Financial Services. “The truth is India will not get anywhere unless educated people enter politics. A governance revolution has been ignited in India and she’s put her hat in the ring. I hope this inspires other people as well.""
	
	Born on October 15, 1961, Sanyal had her school education in Mumbai and New Delhi. Unlike many management aspirants who head to the US, she travelled to France to complete her management education from Insead. When she nearly gave up on job hunt and was about to return to the West, she had an offer from Grindlays Bank which led to a near three decade of banking career.

	 

	
	
	In 1992 she joined ABN Amro, that was acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland, and served in many departments including administration when she introduced hiring people with different abilities and weaker sections, though on merit. “She is cerebral, articulate and a sharp person,"" says a former colleague now with a rival who did not want to be identified. “Meera was always responsible for the administrative function. People who work under have good things to say.""
	Although she has not shared her political thought in public, given her background and her tweets, she may be closer to the liberal economic philosophy, than a welfare state approach.
	
	The Thatcher era comes to an end! Rest in peace Maggie - you reformed & liberalised politics & economics for an entire generation,'' Sanyal tweeted after the Britain's Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher died on Monday.
	
	Sanyal was also convenor of the Indian Liberal Group, an association of people with liberal thoughts, founded by Minoo Masani, especially when it comes to economic policies opposing Congress party's statist policies.
	
	Her commitment to policies may be strong, but to be politically successful in the poor dominated system, she may have to change her ways if she has to succeed.
	
	She'll have to lose those pearls first,'' said writer Shobha De before the 2009 elections. And switch to earthy, home spun salwar kameezes before that. But how on earth will she communicate her objectives to a constituency that has been spoilt and nurtured over decades by politicos with pockets as deep as the ocean?''

A week ago, it had mobilised Rs 1,500 crore by offering the same securities.
 
 “We have got approval for Rs 3,769 crore collectively this year, and are raising it in two tranches as we did not collect the full amount in the first issue,” a senior company official told ET, confirming the second tranche of fund raising.
 
 The bonds will open for bidding on Wednesday as the coupon rate is expected to be fixed above 10-15 basis points higher than the benchmark government bonds.
 
 
 “The fixed spread finalised in the bidding process will be added to the average of two weeks' benchmark sovereign bonds estimated at 8.19%,” said an investment banker familiar with the matter, but didn't wish to be named.
 
 This means, the annualised yield could be at 8.50-8.51% compared with 8.41% in the earlier issue. MTNL securities are rated triple-A (Structured Obligation) by rating companies Crisil and Care.
 
 Structured Obligation signifies the government guarantee, which can be invoked when the issuer defaults in interest repayments.
 
 “The spread between the sovereign and government-guaranteed corporate bonds has contracted significantly to 10-20 bps from about 60 bps last year. This has helped issuers in terms of cost of borrowings,” said Ajay Manglunia, head -fixed income, Edelweiss Securities.
 
 “FIIs, which almost exhausted their investment limit in the G-Secs, are now investing in these securities.”
 
 Last week, FCI bonds slipped two bps below the similar government bonds on higher demand from overseas investors but later corrected a bit. Bond yields and prices move in opposite direction.
 
 MTNL, Food Corporation of India and Air India are three bond issuers who are in the same league, with all of them enjoying a sovereign guarantee status.
 
 Despite not being in the best of financial health, overseas investors rush to lap up these securities as they treat them as quasi-government securities.
 
 Earlier, big investors like HSBC, JPMorgan were seen investing in such issues.

OVL to raise up to $1 billion via dollar issue to fund Azerbaijan buy,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ovl-to-raise-up-to-1-billion-via-dollar-issue-to-fund-azerbaijan-buy/articleshow/19353229.cms,m.economictimes.com,OVL to raise up to $1 billion via dollar issue to fund Azerbaijan buy,"NEW DELHI: ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), on Tuesday said it aims to raise up to $1 billion through a dollar issue this month to fund its recent acquisition in Azerbaijan. 

 OVL last week concluded a $1.001 billion deal to buy US energy major Hess Corp's 2.7% stake in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oilfields in Azerbaijan, and 2.4% of the associated BTC pipeline. 

 ""It makes sense to raise cheaper debt through overseas bond issuance,"" OVL Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event here. The company had initially planned to issue its maiden overseas bond between January and March, but delayed it to complete the acquisition. 

 He said refinancing was easier since all of OVL's assets and liabilities are denominated in dollars. 

 The company, which gets most of its funds from its parent firm, has already appointed merchant bankers for raising the debt, a source said. ""There is no doubt that dollar debt is cheaper than rupee borrowings,"" he said. 

 The Azerbaijan acquisition was OVL's biggest since 2009 when it bought UK-listed, Russia-focused Imperial Energy for $2.1 billion. 

 ACG, which is located in the south Caspian Sea, about 95 km off the coast of Azerbaijan, is the largest oil and gas field complex in Azerbaijan and one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/quick-heal-may-be-indias-first-pure-software-co-to-take-the-ipo-route/articleshow/31860061.cms,m.economictimes.com,Quick Heal may be India's first pure software co to take the IPO route,"MUMBAI: A decade ago, it took Quick Heal time and hard work to convince software giant Microsoft that the small Indian outfit was serious about the business of building anti-virus software.
 
 Since then, Quick Heal, which started out as a gadget repair shop, has risen to become an IPO prospect, travelling a path that was far from easy. When they file their draft red herring prospectus in December, they might well be the first pure software products company from India to list, although others such as Mumbai-listed Persistent Systems build software for global customers.
 
 In 1990, Kailash Katkar, who says he barely passed his matriculation, started a calculator and computer repair shop with 15,000 from his savings. His younger brother Sanjay Katkar was studying computer science at an engineering college, and was working on an anti-virus project and often came to practice on the shop's computer.
 
 ""We noticed that every time Sanjay came, the computer would work properly and if he had not come for sometime there would be lots of problems. So, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just running these programmes he had created to clean out the viruses,"" said Kailash Katkar.
 
 That was how Quick Heal was born. The company initially sold the software along with annual maintenance contracts, a business that Katkar kept active until 1999 to fund the anti-virus business. ""When we started we couldn't get any money from banks. No one wanted to trust us. Now, they keep chasing us and we have to tell them that we don't need money,"" said Kailash, who is the CEO of the company, with his brother Sanjay taking on the role of chief technology officer.
 
 Quick Heal started at a time when there was no software product from India and little if any venture capital activity. The company received its first venture capital funding in 2010 from Sequoia, the same firm that recently boasted of nearly $3-billion payday from its investment in mobile messaging service, WhatsApp. Sequoia put in Rs 60 crore into Quick Heal, valuing the Pune-based company at Rs 600 crore at the time. That valuation has only grown in the last two years.
 
 
 

 
 ""The minimum they could expect is a Rs 1,200-crore valuation. It could be much more, depending on their actual numbers,"" said an investment banker, who declined to be identified. ""Product firms are rare but they are typically given a valuation of some multiples of revenue, but there is currently no benchmark for a company like Quick Heal in India,"" the banker said.
 
 The lack of a benchmark worries the Katkars, who are currently in the process of appointing independent directors and consultants to determine a valuation for the company. However, other IPOs such as the one for Just Dial have increased Quick Heal's confidence in its plans.

Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/reserve-bank-of-india-changes-in-gilt-auctions-seen-as-sign-of-stable-rates/articleshow/39221348.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Reserve Bank of India changes in gilt auctions seen as sign of stable rates,"A couple of moves by the RBI while announcing Friday's auction for government securities (G-secs) has surprised the bond market.
 
 But dealers and analysts said that the indications, taken together, signify that the central bank is expecting a stable interest rate, at least over the next 12-18 months.
 
 On Monday , RBI announced that it will auction another lot of the new 10year paper, 8.40% GS 2024, worth Rs 9,000 crore, making it the second consecutive week of auctioning the same paper. This is probably the first time RBI has decided to auction the same paper over two successive weeks. The central bank has also moved from an uniform price auction to multiple price auction method for this Friday .
 
 Dealers said that the current yield on the new 10-year, which will be the new benchmark rate for the market, is at 8.43% per annum. In contrast, the old 10-year, which was the benchmark till last Friday , is trading at a yield of 8.71%. Ideally , the two benchmarks should not have such a large variation which at present is nearly 30 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point). “With more supply of the new 10-year in Friday's auction, this distortion will be corrected soon,“ a top dealer with a domestic bond house said.
 
 The RBI decision is also expected to increase the lifecycle of the new 10-year gilt and also the current 14-year.
 
 In all likelihood, the next 10year will be introduced only after eight-nine months, dealers said. Usually , RBI introduces two 10-year papers every year to indicate the benchmark rate that it is comfortable with. “If the RBI is extending the lifecycle of a 10-year, it is probably (another) indication that rates will be stable and hence it will not tweak with the benchmark paper,“ the dealer said.
 
 During auctions, usually the central bank also uses the uniform price method which ensures bond buyers get the gilts in the auction at an uniform yield. On the other hand, in multiple price auctions, while bidding bond houses should be more careful about the price they are willing to pay . By changing the bidding method, RBI is indicating bond players to be very careful about rates going forward, bond market players said.

Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/retail-investors-should-assign-60-weightage-to-large-cap-stocks-in-their-portfolio-experts/articleshow/45759550.cms,m.economictimes.com,Retail investors should assign 60% weightage to large cap stocks in their portfolio: Experts,"NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex, which rose 30 per cent in the calendar year 2014, looks all set to touch fresh record highs in the year 2015 and large cap stocks are likely to lead the rally, say experts.

For the year 2014, the Sensex outperformed with annual return of 30 per cent, whereas FD rates were 9 per cent and gold gave negative returns. There are typically five asset classes to choose from for retail investors, namely - equities, gold, fixed income, currency and commodities.

Equities as an asset class is likely to outperform other asset classes in the year 2015 and retail investors should look at buying quality stocks on every dip.

""For retail investors our advice is to invest wisely in equities, in 60:40 ratio - with 60% of portfolio to be assigned for large caps and 40% for mid-caps,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.

""In the year 2015 we are expecting good returns in the mid cap sector, but as risk is high, we cannot put high stakes on it. It is best to concentrate on solid stocks with great long-term growth potential and use the strategy of buying in dips,"" adds Gupta.

He further adds that mutual funds can also be a great option if direct market participation is not feasible or in case there is less risk appetite.

Considering the fact that equities are likely to outperform other asset classes, investors should remain cautious while picking stocks for their portfolio. One can look for a company that offers unique products or has a foothold in a niche market.

Consider stocks that are fundamentally solid - a strong cash position, little or no long-term debt, growing revenues, ongoing profitability, and a good growth strategy, say experts. It is also good to look for stocks that return income to investors in the form of a share repurchase program and dividends.

""Equities as an asset class are much more likely to outperform the other asset classes. Fixed income investments are being peddled by many on the basis that the RBI will cut interest rates and hence one should invest in them to capture the one-time upside to the principal,"" says Dr Vikas V Gupta, Executive Vice President at ArthVeda Fund Management Pvt. Ltd.

""However, go into equities with a consciousness of your own risk appetite and allocate a portion for the long-term. Start with a reasonable lump-sum of about 10-20 per cent of your financial corpus and then add SIPs so that in 6 months you have about 30% of the financial corpus,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that one should stick to index-oriented funds and safer large cap strategies. Small and midcaps also have a role in investors’ portfolio, but to a lesser extent.


	 

Experts across Dalal Street advise investors that they should not chase past returns; i.e. since BSE Small Cap has given 100% returns in the last one year, so one should not get enticed that that will continue in the future.

It is expected that 30 per cent CAGR in EPS is possible over the next 5 years, according to our market analysis, says Gupta. This is likely to provide very high returns over the next 5 years.

However, retail investors should develop their own understanding of equities and read up Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor before jumping lock-stock-and-barrel into equities, advise experts.

""As far as retail investors are concerned, the current set-up of Indian equity markets is unprecedented. The next three-five years look very good from the corporate growth and return perspective,"" says Vikas Khemani, Edelweiss Financial Services.

""People have to invest in equities. You can have a systematic investment plan. Obviously, one has to look at one’s own risk-reward profile. But in my opinion, for every retail investor, equity exposure has to be a significant part of their savings pool,"" he adds.

Khemani is of the view that at least 15% to 20% return over the next four-five years will come from equities. And the best part is that it is also tax free. So, equities are definitely a great asset class for any retail investor, he concludes.

Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: The dollar strength going past 89. What is your view on the rupee? 

 
Manoj Rane: The rupee is one of the few currencies which has held up during this bout of dollar strengthening. We have seen about a 3 per cent depreciation from a 60 level. It is nothing compared to what where the Yen is today. It is almost 120 and the euro is 1.23. So you have seen 10 to 15 per cent depreciation against the dollar for other currencies. In fact INR is one of the currencies which would have strengthened against most other currencies other than USD.
 
 We are so USD focus that we do react a lot to whatever weakness we see even on an intraday basis on the currency side. The good news is that 62 continues to be supported. I am not sure when I say that whether it is really good news or bad news because a certain weakness or slight weakness in the currency is in my mind good for the country, trade and our current account deficit. So to that extent I do think this level will possibly hold the currency on an around 62. I do not expect significant depreciation from here.

ET Now: From a sectoral point of view, what would you bet big on keeping the budget in mind? Do you think there is going to be any sector-impacting news, because a lot has already come in, such as the extension of duty cuts on autos till December? 

 
Anish Damania: This budget is going to drive the roadmap for the next five years. I would really like to see how the budget pans out. I want to see what the Budget does about investment expenditure. It may go about it by raising tax revenue or cutting wasteful expenditure, and allocating the amount towards investment. 

 I also want to see what the budget does about fiscal deficits and how it proposes to prime the economy. 

 These are the various steps that I am looking at. I am not comfortable with the scenario where the government will expect a higher revenue growth than the 10-11% out of the taxes. It is not going to be that easy to increase tax revenues as much as expected. So I also want to see the divestment targets of this government. I want them to be very aggressive because there is liquidity. They need to harness this global liquidity in their favour. 

 Last year, it was about Rs 276 billion. I am expecting that this year they will target close to Rs 700 billion or so in terms of divestments. I want to see those kind of numbers in the Budget. I think the areas where divestment happens are going to be the ones that will become more attractive.

  Gajendra Nagpal, CEO, Unicon Financial Solutions in a chat with ET Now talks about IPOs and anchor investors.
  
  
  Three IPOs are lined up for today. Some of the anchor investors are pure hedge funds, who sell 10 days after they buy. So, should you look at anchor investors and when you look at them, should you rather prefer investors who do not buy and sell?
   
  Obviously, these funds have some kind of a legacy, some kind of a credibility in the market place. If there are better names on the side of anchor investors, then one tends to feel more comfortable. A similar case applies elsewhere also. If there is a great guy getting into a particular product, you do not mind getting into it because the great guy has got it but if the hedge funds are, the ones who are becoming anchor investors and at times we also hear that these are back-to-back arrangements from the promoter group within the fund, they are IAR, which are absolutely predetermined. There are all kinds of things that happen that we keep hearing about from time to time, so one has to be very careful. If the quality anchor investors are there, definitely it is more comforting from the retail investor’s standpoint.

 This includes how much the company is spending on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a percentage of its net profit, the number of stakeholders' complaints received and resolved, details of any pending case filed by stakeholder against any unfair trade practice, irresponsible advertising or anti-competitive behaviour adopted by the company. 

 This will enable the shareholders to have a better understanding of the manner in which their companies' function and adopt responsible business practices. 

 The circular dated August 13 exhorts the companies to follow the national voluntary guidelines on social, environmental and economic responsibility that have been formulated by ministry of corporate affairs in July 2011. 

 Companies are expected to share information like number of employees hired on temporary or contractual basis, any legal notices received from pollution control boards and number of consumer complaints pending at the end of the fiscal. 

 While most leading companies like L&T, HUL, Dr Reddy's Labs, Tata Motors, ITC and ICICI Bank are already publishing a separate sustainability report along with their annual reports, the circular will make it compulsory for all top 100 companies to report their responsibility initiatives and also bring in certain uniformity in their reporting. 

 ""It is a step in the right direction by the SEBI. However, it is not a surprise. The industry knew that something like this was coming,"" said the head of CSR division in a Nifty company. Most of the companies must be in the process of making themselves ready for such reporting. 

 If a company has to follow it, it has to start early as there has to be a system put in place and it is an initiative where the whole organization has to be involved, he added. 

 Under the structure that has been suggested, the companies also have to provide the details of the director responsible for implementation of the business responsibility policies. In case a company is not abiding by any of the principles to be reported, it has to explain the reasons of its failure to do so. 

 The Companies bill 2011, which is making it mandatory for certain companies to report their responsibility initiatives, is still pending approval from the parliament. Meanwhile SEBI through its circular has made business responsibility reporting mandatory for at least the large companies. 

 The circular shall be applicable with effect from fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2012. Sustainability experts expect the regulation to be progressively made applicable to all companies listed on the stock exchanges. The national voluntary guidelines are already applicable to all Indian companies including multinationals as well as small and medium enterprises. 

 The companies that already submit sustainability reports to their stakeholders based on internationally accepted reporting frameworks have to only map the principles contained in the national voluntary guidelines to their existing sustainability reports.

 The EBITDA for quarter stood at Rs 295.64 million and the EBITDA margin for Q1 FY 2013 was 10.4% as a percentage of total income even though the industry faced several challenges in the first quarter. TBZ maintained Net Profit margin at 5.74% for the quarter on account of a judicious sales mix of gold and diamond wherein diamond jewellery sales enhanced the margins.

We deployed an interesting sales mix of gold, diamond and fusion jewellery while unveiling exciting new collections such as Dohra collection to entice the customers and increase same store sales.

Air Indias insurance contract up for renewal on October 1 for an estimated $25 million,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/air-indias-insurance-contract-up-for-renewal-on-october-1-for-an-estimated-25-million/articleshow/43113261.cms,m.economictimes.com,Air India’s insurance contract up for renewal on October 1 for an estimated $25 million,"MUMBAI: The race for Air India’s insurance account is boiling down to a contest between the public and private sector. A consortium of state-owned insurers led, by New India Assurance, has emerged as the frontrunner for the national carrier’s business, while the private sector has rallied behind a group led by ICICI Lombard General Insurance. The insurance contract for the flag carrier’s 105-strong fleet comes up for renewal on October 1 at an estimated premium of about $25 million. 

 
Experts said the New India Assuranceled consortium has United India Insurance, Oriental Insurance and National Insurance as co-insurers. The other group has ICICI Lombard General Insurance as lead insurer and Reliance General and HDFC Ergo as co-insurers. 

 The insurance companies ET spoke with on the matter declined to comment. However, a senior executive at a staterun insurer said the New India Assurance-led consortium was ahead in the race. 

 According to industry executives, aviation premiums have increased following arise in mishaps, pushing up the bill for insurers. For instance, in 2013 when the market had softened, Air India paid a premium of $23 million. This was lower by over $1 million than the premium in 2010 when an Air India Express jet crashed in Mangalore killing 158 people. 

 General insurers led by Reliance General that had provided cover to Air India in 2010 had to pay Rs 350-400 crore in compensation claims. Most of the claim money came from international reinsurers who dictate rates depending on the state of the market. 

 Air India’s current insurance policy, issued by New India Assurance, includes a $9.5-billion hull cover and a combined single liability of $1.5 billion. 

 Hull all-risk insurance covers any damage to the body of the aircraft caused by an accident, while war risk, part of hull cover, insures against war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking. In addition, the insurance covers liability toward passengers and covers legal protection against suits. 

 A series of aviation disasters this year—the disappearance of a Malaysian Airlines jetliner in March, the crash of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft in Ukraine in July and that of an Air Algeria plane in Mali in the same month—have turned aviation insurers wary.

 The Reserve Bank of India has on Wednesday released a market borrowing calendar stating that state governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, will sell about Rs 95,000-1,05,000 crore worth of bonds between January and March next year through central bank auction system. 

 With this higher-than-expected capital market fund mop-ups, investors including insurers, pension funds would be flooded with excess supply of securities. Markets were expecting state bond sales in the range of Rs 65,000-75,000 crore in the fourth quarter. 

 “The amount of proposed bond sales is higher than market expectations,” said Soumyajit Niyogi, analyst, interest rates, SBI DFHI Primary Dealers. “The excess supply along with other securities will help future investors to earn higher.” 

 “Issuers may have to fork out higher rates to woo investors as the yield curve would remain elevated,” he said. By March, markets could also see Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore worth of ‘discom’ bonds coming out of state-owned power distribution companies under the bailout scheme christened as “Uday”. Moreover, tax free bonds are already attracting retail investors with a cumulative Rs 40,000 crore issuances expected by financial yearend. The central government too will issue about Rs 80,000-85,000 crore routine sovereign bonds between January and February, dealers said. 

 Excess supply will lead to rise in bond yields pushing prices down in the existing bonds. 

 New tax free bonds may now have to offer higher rates as those are priced in link with the benchmark bond yield. State bonds are now yielding 8.25-8.27% half yearly, which about 50 basis points higher than the benchmark sovereign yield. 

 During October-December quarter such bond sales was in the range Rs 75,000-80,000. About six months ago, for the first time, the central bank had issued a tentative calendar for selling state securities in line with central government bonds. In the July-September quarter, 10 states and one of the union territories had sold Rs 45,000-50,000 crore bonds. State bonds are mostly of 10-year maturities while states like Gujarat and Karnataka have introduced five-year papers too.

 Aydogan Cakmaz, Head - R&D at DICV, will take over as Head - R&D for Trucks Asia and will based at the MFTBC Headquarters at Kawasaki, Japan, effective July 1, 2013, the company said in a statement. 

 Cakmaz will oversee all R&D operations of Daimler Trucks for Asia. He was instrumental in the development of the BharatBenz range of trucks building in them the reliability arising out of intense testing and engineering, it added. 

 Under the recently announced Daimler Trucks Asian business model involving integration of certain key areas, the first integration involves the R&D of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck & Bus Corporation (MFTBC) (a Daimler Company), Japan. 

 Hidekazo Kanno, Head - Product Lifecycle Management at MFTBC, Japan, will take over as Head - R&D for DICV, at Chennai, effective on Monday. He will now report to Cakmaz, the company added. 

 In an other change not related to the Asian Business Model, DICV said its CFO Sanjiv Khurana will take over as President - Remanufacturing Division, Daimler Trucks North America at Portland, Oregon, USA, effective July 1 2013. 

 Khurana has completed his term at DICV. He has been with DICV since its inception. As a key member of DICV's Executive Committee and several core teams, he has contributed immensely to DICV's establishment in India, it added.

Pankaj Pandey: Largely if you look at there are some segments which do well at a certain point in time and then there are certain segments which become a drag so similarly for example it looks like that metal as a pack might be a sort of a drag on the company.  	Earlier you had oil and gas which was posing challenges for the company, but largely if you look at what we are expecting is that in this particular quarter things would remain soft for the company and it is largely a soft quarter.  	But in terms of order inflows, it will be similar to what has happened in the last quarter so about 11500 odd crores that is what the company has disclosed, so we are expecting about 4 to 5% top line growth and a similar bottom line growth with same margins.  	The key takeaway going forward will be that over the next three to six months, we would expect a lot of announcements to happen on the ordering side which is where we would expect this company to do far better, which is why we would expect that probably the demand would continue to hold its guidance of 15% order growth and we are expecting a similar sort of top line growth and a shade below margin and a shade below profit growth.

Inox Wind’s IPO was oversubscribed 35 times. It closed at Rs 438 — 35% higher than its offer price on Thursday. Another example is of Marico Kaya, a subsidiary of Marico which was listed in July 2014. The stock has so far gained 750%. Intellect Design, a subsidiary of Polaris Consulting Services, has gained 70% since its listing in December 2014.
 
 Spinning off the less profitable business once it turns around and becomes self-sustainable not only creates value for the shareholders of the new listed entity but also for the shareholders of the parent company. ETIG has identified some of the companies that may see a potential separate listing of the smaller or less profitable businesses.
 
 
Eicher Motors
 
 For Eicher Motors, separate listing of its commercial vehicle business could be a game changer. The bike business may be around one-third of the top-line, but contributed 90% to the entire profit in CY14. According to analysts, the bike business will grow at least 60% for the next two years (it grew by 100% in CY14) and should get a P/E multiple of 25 on FY17 earnings.
 
 This means, the bike business on a standalone basis is valued at Rs 36,000 crore. Considering this, the commercial vehicle business is valued at only Rs 6,500 crore (the current market capitalisation of Rs 42,500 crore lessRs 36,000 crore of bike business valuation). The commercial vehicle business, which is a joint venture with Swedish auto giant Volvo, gives two-thirds of Eicher’s total sales and has already started to show a turnaround.
 
 

HSIL
 
 HSIL is the biggest player in the sanitary ware business with close to 60% market share and the highest margin in the industry. But, it has a market capitalisation less than its peer – Cera Sanitaryware. This is because HSIL also has a glass business which was loss-making till a few quarters ago with a debt of close to Rs 800 crore.
 
 In the glass packaging business it is one of the top two players in the country. It became loss-making two years ago after the industry capacity increased amid the demand slowdown. However, now the glass industry has consolidated with only few players and the demand is improving. HSIL’s glass business has shown a strong turnaround. The recent institutional placement will bring down the debt significantly. In the past, the management has mentioned about demerging the two businesses.
 
 
Tata Global Beverages
 
 Since the time Tata Global Beverages and Starbucks signed the joint venture in India, Tata Global Beverages’ market capitalisation has remained almost stagnant. Analysts are not giving the full valuation to the Starbucks business, which has already opened close to 70 stores and 70% of that in the last one year.
 
 The company is expected to have 400 Starbucks outlets by FY18 and achieve breakeven. Once that happens, there could be a separate listing of Starbucks. Jubilant FoodWorks with close to 800 stores is valued at over Rs 10,000 crore and Tata Global Beverages together with its tea, coffee and Starbucks businesses is valued at Rs 9,300 crore.

 Nasdaq’s entry into the India market comes at a time when the US-based stock exchange is looking to expand its footprint in emerging markets including India. Industry insiders believe that the exchange is hoping to cash-in on the optimism fueling the technology sector and get manystart-ups access capital by helping them get listed at the stock market. 

 ""We look forward to the long-term opportunities our presence in Bangalore will provide for us,"" said Robert Frojd, regional manager, Southeast Asia for NASDAQ OMX. 

 Details of the management at the India office were not mentioned in the press release. An email was sent to the Nasdaq this morning, before US working hours. 

 Nasdaq first opened its Bangalore office in 2001 and was present until the year 2009. However, in the eight years Nasdaq was present on the ground, the exchange could not get any Indian firm listed on its stock exchange, according to data from Dealogic and the Nasdaq’s website. 

 This was primarily because experts believed there very few incentives for the companies to get listed, with the problems getting exacerbated by the the many regulatory bottlenecks ahead of the India firms to get listed in the US. 

 However, this time many believe the exchange could find success and get firms access to capital as the exchange may have learnt from its mistakes during the first stint. 

 Kiran Karnik, a former president of India’s software industry association body Nasscom said the decision to set up an office in India, after having gone through a turmoil, is an optimistic step. 

 ""For startups in Bangalore, especially the one’s that are growing fast, this is a great opportunity to get to Nasdaq,"" he said. 

 Over the past few years, Nasdaq has been expanding its presence beyond the US and European markets by wooing listings from companies in Southeast Asia. It has listed 8 Indian companies, including pharmaceutical firm Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, ICICI Bank and Sify Technologies . 

 India’s second largest software firm Infosys had moved its listing from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext's New York Stock Exchange in 2012 to increase its access to European investors. Infosys was replaced by Facebook on the Nasdaq-100 index.

Investors have invited banks to pitch for the mandate this week, said two people close to the development. 

 On the back of growing investor demand for financial services companies, the promoters see an IPO as the best option to raise capital. If the company files for an IPO, it will become the first sizeable nonbanking financial company (NBFC) to list in the last four years. 

 Founded in 2010 by Everstone Capital, Indostar provides long term funding to Indian businesses and infrastructure projects. ""The presentations from bankers will be made this week. A few banks will be appointed soon,"" said one of the persons. 

 ""Apart from four global banks, a couple of domestic banks will be appointed. The issue is expected to be launched around June 2016,"" said the second person. 

 Everstone Capital managing partner Dhanpal Jhaveri declined to comment. 

 Last year, Ashmore Capital, one of the founding partners of Indostar, exited the business by selling its stake to Everstone Capital and ACPI. Apart from Everstone and Goldman Sachs, Indostar is owned by Beacon India Private Equity Fund, ACPI and China Development Finance's investment arm CDIB. 

 Indostar's loan portfolio stood at Rs 3,375 crore on 31 March, according to an October ratings release by Care India. The company's net worth is more than Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Having focused on wholesale lending, the company is now increasingly looking at small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to diversify its loan portfolio. On March 31, around 30 per cent of loans were to the real estate sector, 66.5 per cent to corporate financing and 2.9 per cent was given out against shares. The company's vehicle finance portfolio was 0.2 per cent of the total. This is one reason why Indostar is able to maintain a healthy portfolio with gross nonperforming assets at 0.77 per cent and net non-performing assets at 0.064 per cent of total loans, experts said. 

 Indostar clocked around Rs 149 crore in post-tax profit in FY15, up from Rs 112 crore in the previous year. This growth was achieved on the back of total income of Rs 528 crore.

ET Now: What is your take on the auto stocks? How are you dissecting the game between four-wheelers and two-wheelers? Between four-wheelers too, it is a divide between CVs and passenger vehicles. Your thoughts? 

 
Rajat Rajgarhia: The top stocks in auto right now are very clear. They are Maruti and Tata Motors. As of Maruti — while the stock is at its all-time high — the volumes have been almost flat for the last four years. We think that over the next three-four years when the volume moves from the current 1.2 million to close to 2 million, the operating leverage along with a stable currency can do wonders to its earnings, and similarly, to the stock. 

 Same is the case with Tata Motors. JLR continues to hold on well, but the domestic business has been a drag. It will return with a big bang over the years to come. It means not just a higher earnings, but also a higher valuation for the stock. 

 M&M has also reported the July month volumes, with both UVs and tractors showing a decline. At this point of time, it would definitely not be on the priority list, because we will have to see how, at what point of time, both of their businesses start doing well. Generally the stock will only do well when you will see both these units growing into double digits. But that is not happening anytime in the near future. 

 To me, both Tata Motors and Maruti will keep on dragging for some more time.

"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-move-on-fast-track-rights-fpos-to-help-government-in-disinvestment-of-state-owned-companies/articleshow/42843402.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi's move on Fast Track rights, FPOs to help government in disinvestment of state-owned companies","MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi is planning to allow more listed companies to raise funds through ‘fast track’ follow-on public offers (FPOs) and rights issues, provided issuers fulfil certain conditions. The proposed move could also make it easier for the government to divest stake in some of the state-owned companies.
 
 Companies having a free-float market capitalisation above Rs 250 crore will be able take this route, according to a regulatory official. This will make more than 300 listed companies eligible for the fast track fundraising option. Apart from meeting existing criteria, companies will also have to fulfil additional conditions – like, promoters will have to compulsorily subscribe to rights entitlement, the stock should not have been suspended from trading in the past three years due to regulatory violations, no conflict of interest should prevail between lead manager and issuer and promoters, and the company should not have settled any violation of securities law through consent mechanism.
 
 The regulator is keen to further reduce the time for processing offer documents for companies with good track record. At present, compliant listed companies satisfying certain specific conditions and having a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore are allowed to access the primary market in a time effective manner. Such companies can proceed with FPOs and rights issue by filing a copy of prospectus with stock exchanges and Sebi. They are not required to file draft offer document for Sebi comments.
 
 What is now being proposed is making rules simpler for a larger number of companies. “The fast track route will significantly shorten the fund-raising process for companies,” said Praveen Chakarvarty, a member of Sebi’s primary market advisory committee and former managing director of BNP Paribas.
 
 “Typically, for a company wishing to raise money through an FPO or rights issue (with Sebi review), the timeline is about 5-7 months, which is very long in the current environment,” said Sudhir Bassi, executive director-capital markets of the law firm Khaitan & Co. “In order to make FPO and rights issue more popular modes of raising funds by corporates, it would be useful if Sebi relaxes the eligibility requirements for fast track issuers.”
 
 The new rule on fast track issuances is expected to cover all PSUs, irrespective of their market capitalisation – a step that could facilitate the government's divestment programme. On the proposal on making it incumbent on promoters to subscribe to their rights entitlement, Chakarvarty said, “This is in line with international investing practices.”
 
 In 2012, the regulator had reduced the threshold of free-float market capitalisation for issuers accessing the market through fast-track FPOs and rights issues to Rs 3,000 crore from Rs 5,000 crore. Sebi had introduced the concept of fast track issues in 2007. The regulator is not in favour of making the fast track route available to all companies as the process involves restricted due diligence.
 
 But some experts feel all publicly traded companies should be able to avail this facility. “All listed companies should be allowed to use the fast track route. However, to be on the conservative side, the current threshold of market cap should definitely be lowered,” said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database. “If a company is already listed and trading is taking place on a daily basis, then there is enough information available in the public domain… why, then, should an FPO or rights issue require a detailed offer document and a Sebi approval?”

Sandeep Wagle: I would say the Nifty is in a corrective mode in the short term. By short term, I mean the next day or two. A move towards 7400-7430, which is a very strong support area, cannot be ruled out. We are playing for that. 

 In case it does not happen, we will cut off the short position on Monday morning. But the weekly view is quite positive. The pattern till now suggests at most a small correction of 100 points. At those levels we would want to go long. 

 I would want to be stock-specific. So if the Nifty finds support at 7430-7400 levels, then I would look at covering a short position and going long, stressing on playing stock-specific.

ET Now: You are positive on Britannia Industries and, in the past, you have liked the stock at Rs 3,100 level. Is Britannia price to perfection?  Mayuresh Joshi: Britannia Industries' valuations are close to 36-odd times FY17 earnings. We believe that it should continue to remain a part of portfolio on few counts. The return on capital (ROC) has showed tremendous improvement from lower levels to around 54 per cent.
 
 The return on equity (ROE) too is at a very decent level at 50 per cent-odd. If you look at the cash convergence cycle, the company is sitting on decent cash at the current juncture. In addition, the cost optimisation efforts that the company is probably taking to margin expansion, I am not of the opinion that the margins would stay at 14-14.5 per cent.
 
 The numbers have been aided by too many factors in the June quarter results. So, low raw material, freight and fuel costs have probably propped up margins. But decent margin expansion has to happen with the cost optimisation plan and premiumisation story — the cookie market — that will still play out. So, in my opinion, investors who have bought the stock at lower levels should continue holding on to it for 10 years though valuations at the current juncture do not warrant a fresh buy at the current level.

Mitesh Thacker: So on the market, you have probably defined the range. The broader range is still about 8,050-8,100 on the upside to about 7,700. Today morning, I talked about the possibility of bounce back happening given the fact that Nifty was on the hourly closing charts, closer to about 7,700-7,690 which was the earlier swing low. The Bank Nifty was at important weekly pivot levels of around 16,200. The bounceback has started. I was expecting it to be choppy bounce back but this appears to be slightly stronger than what my initial expectation was.
 
 You might see a subdued move in the coming one or two days around 7,850 but, overall the next level on the upside should be around 7,925 to about 7,950. With some choppiness in the next two-three sessions or four sessions we might be trading around 7,950-odd levels.

ET Now: What are your thoughts on real estate sector?  N Jayakumar: Everything is a function of the price at which it is trading and real estate has come off quite dramatically. Most of these stocks are quoting very close to what is the equivalent of book. Three months ago there was no off take in the same real-estate. To a large extent that has changed and things are happening at least in metros. In places like Mumbai, South Delhi and Gurgaon there is a fair amount of activity happening which has allowed the real-estate companies to monetise some of their assets.  So, as companies like DLF and Unitech continues to monetise their land banks and keep reducing their debt then there will be a scenario where some of these companies regardless of the external environment will find a base at current levels and could surprise on the upside as liquidity and interest rates ease off in April-May.  ET Now: Would banks be a good bet to put your money in?  N Jayakumar: Banks are the first space that get affected by interest rates. Evaluations and the bond yields are indicating that somewhere along the line the markets are sensing a cut in interest rates and that might be a force cut in interest rates but it will need to have an impact that brings in further rate cuts.  We are far far aggressively placed in terms of interest rates right now which is only hurting growth. Somewhere along the line the RBI will have to cut rates and the banks therefore will bounce-off their lows pretty aggressively indicating further rate cuts. My own sense is that the downside is limited but there could be upsides evolving even from here. Private sectors banks like Yes Bank given their lower propensity to have NPAs will actually be much bigger beneficiaries than the public sector banks.

  MUMBAI: In a long-awaited top management succession planning exercise, corporate giant Larsen and Toubro on Friday appointed K Venkataraman as its CEO and Managing Director, while its current chief A M Naik would remain Executive Chairman for the next five years.
  
  Naik currently holds the position of Chairman and MD at the group, a major player in engineering, manufacturing, construction and a host of other businesses including technology and financial services.
  
  The L&T's board of directors has decided to bifurcate the roles of Chairman and Managing Director in a major top management rejig, which would become effective from April 1.
  
  As per the new structure, Venkataraman would assume the position of Chief Executive Officer and MD, while Naik would assume the post of Executive Chairman.
  
  Krishnamurthi Venkataramanan is currently Whole-time Director and President (Hydrocarbon) and had joined L&T as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in 1969. He was elevated to L&T Board in the year 1995.
  
  ""I am pleased that the board has appointed K Venkataraman as CEO & MD. I have full confidence that under Venkataraman's leadership, L&T will continue on its growth path,"" Naik said. MORE PTI SP BJ SA 03091117 NNNN
  
  While Venkataramanan would be responsible for the businesses of L&T, Naik would focus on completing the portfolio restructuring, institutionalising the IC (Independent Company) structure, mentoring and developing the leadership team and future leaders, the group said.
  
  Naik, a towering corporate leader of the country, had joined L&T as a Junior Engineer in 1965 and rapidly rose to senior positions -- moving from General Manager to Managing Director and CEO, culminating in his appointment as Chairman in December 2003.
  
  L&T said it has undertaken an exercise, named 'Lakshya', to simplify its portfolio and has created 10 independent companies and seven subsidiaries in order to bring focus, autonomy and accountability. It had also engaged services of global strategy firms for the same.
  
  However, changes in the economic environment has led to L&T undertaking a mid-term review of strategic plan, which is now under finalisation, it said in a statement after today's board meeting.
  
  ""In line with the vision of the company to become an Indian Multinational as also looking at the current global competitive environment, it needs to develop leaders who will manage the company, going forward,"" it added.
  
  Accordingly, the board decided that there was a need for continuity and requested Naik to continue for a period of five years as Executive Chairman of the Group.
  
  ""I am honoured with the responsibility that the board has placed on me. I am also happy that A M Naik's guidance will continue to be available,"" Venkataraman said.
  
  The company said its board was confident that its decision was in the best interest of all stakeholders.
  
  L&T shares rose 4.7 per cent to Rs 1,294.75 in early morning trade.

ET Now: We may have hit a fresh high on the Nifty, but somehow market internals do not inspire too much of confidence. Your view?
 
 
Mayuresh Joshi: In view of what has transpired over the past few weeks and months, and given the exuberance that we have seen in the market, our take is that the markets have done more or less enough from a short- to medium-term perspective.
 
 In the post-budget speech, the exchequer was very clear in terms of policy implementation when he said that it will take at least a quarter or more to frame policies and implement them. So, keeping this in mind, if the markets are assuming that a lot of policy action will happen over the next few months, they would be wrong because it is unlikely to happen.
 
 Secondly, the inherent risk that the markets face is the monsoons. The next two months will be critical as to how the monsoons pan out. In case there is some shortage in terms of the overall spread of rains across the country, you might have your inflationary pressures peaking out.
 
 Thirdly, a lot will depend on how the global scenario plays out. Also crucial is what the FED does over the next two to three months. These are something that world markets are watching out for.
 
 So, if one considers all these factors, one would see that the only thing that is left for the markets from short- to medium-term perspective is the corporate earnings. Corporate earnings are going to be a little bit subdued for this quarter and for two-three quarters to come. You are not going to see an exponential rise both in top line and bottom line for most companies.
 
 There would hardly be any exponential growth and even if there is, it would be very stock-specific.
 
 Markets will trade in a range. Even in terms of valuations from an FY15 perspective, we are trading at a fair valuation. So, our take is that the Nifty will find it very difficult to breach the 7900-mark. It might possibly stay in a range of 7250-7900 over the next two to three months.

ET Now: Unfortunately it is wobbly market scenario. Otherwise, we would have seen positive banking reaction maybe? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: What the SEBI has announced is positive for the banking sector. Even the conversion from debt to equity, because the apex body has tinkered with the pricing formula, is quote positive for the sector. We have seen the infamous case of Kingfisher where banks had to finally convert their debt into equity. But, the price they got was meaningless as the ruling market price was significantly lower. It was based on the earlier formula. 

 So, this will give banks tremendous leeway in getting prices which should be more realistic. 

 Now, as we have also realised that the domestic stock market especially from midcaps is very narrow, therefore, taking the six-month average price tends to be misleading at times. 

 But one thing has to be keep in mind that banks cannot hold more than 30 per cent in any company at present. Hence, that needs to be changed. Banks must be given maximum leeway to stakes in in companies and change the managements. 

 Changing managements is critical especially in times when asset quality is such a huge issue and when there are many cases in which managements really have siphoned out money. They do not really deserve to be managing the businesses. Therefore, it is critical that banks get an appropriate price when they convert their debt into equity and they are able to remove existing managements to get new persons on board. It would thus raise some hopes of preserving the asset quality of the underlying loan. 

 ET Now: You may get assets at equity valuations; you may even get it at an attractive price, but that will not change the complexion of the business. A bad asset is a bad asset; the way a bad asset could be revived is that you need to restructure the whole process and you need to really infuse some cash flows. This new formula does not take care of the revival plan. Am I right? 

 

 Hemindra Hazari: True, but that problem can be fixed only by improvement in macro-economy. I really do not, I am not at all optimistic that especially after this Budget that we are going to see any significant revival. Having said that, what is critical is that if banks hold a significant chunk of equity, they can leverage that position to remove the existing management. It is because in a lot of cases, it is the management which remain responsible the poor asset quality. 

 Either they have taken commercial decisions, which were not all viable or they have siphoned out huge amounts of cash from the projects. 

 A lot of the infrastructure projects are highly inflate the cost and banks anyway have to take a hit. Therefore, it is better that they take a hit and remove the management and replace a more stable, confident and reputable management than to have the existing management still in place. Then you are just throwing good money after bad.

 ""We are yet to conclude on the final issuance deal,"" M S Raghavan, chairman and managing director, IDBI Bank, told ET, confirming the move. The bank may do away with the issuance if it doesn’t get the right pricing. ""We have already received bids,"" the CMD added. 

 The interest rate is apparently set at 8.74%, but the bank chairman has not yet approved it. SBI Capital Market is the sole arranger of the issuance, three people familiar with the matter said. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is likely to be the largest investor in the issuance. 

 Ratings agency Crisil has assigned an AA+/Stable rating to the bond issuance. 

 The central provident fund body receives interest payment in a wide range of about Rs 5,000-8,000 crore on Special Deposit Scheme, launched by the government in July 1975, on the first day of every calendar year. 

 Earlier, in September last year, IDBI Bank mopped up Rs 1,000 crore by issuing infrastructure bonds. The coupon or interest rate was at 9.5% with similar maturity. This time, the bank would be better-off with cheaper rates as the benchmark 10-year government bond yield is now hovering 64-68 basis points lower compared to September. 

 About a month ago, country’s third-largest private sector lender, Axis Bank, collectedRs 5,705 crore by selling infrastructure bonds offering 8.85% rate. Those were rated as triple-A by CRISIL & ICRA. India’s largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank, too sold infra bonds for about Rs 3,900 crore in early September. Last year, RBI facilitated long-term lending in infrastructure and affordable or low cost housing.

  In his long and chequered career as a politician and administrator, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is unlikely to have faced a more daunting task than finalising this Budget. The competing pressures on him were intense. Fiscal deficit was way over the numbers projected in last Budget. Inflation, which had cooled in the early months of 2012, was again raising its head. Investment and consequently growth had slowed down to about 7%. Clearly, what was needed was a budget that attempted a fiscal course correction while giving an impetus to growth - itself an onerous task.

  Complicating the scenario further were the setbacks in the recent assembly elections and growing dissonance between the Congress and its allies on various policies. This meant that the political room for big bang reforms was clearly limited. Given these constraints, the finance minister has managed to perform a minor miracle. He has admirably balanced the various pulls and pressures and yet delivered a budget for growth by maintaining consumption, reviving investment, boosting capital markets and widening the tax net. 
  
  The FM is looking at capping the fiscal deficit at 5.1% for FY13. This seems realistic. His positive steps include putting FRBM implementation back on the agenda, capping the subsidy at 2% of the GDP, with the promise of reducing it to 1.7%. Also, if the government is able to deliver on the FM's promise to direct cash transfers using the UID mechanism, it would help plug leakages. All the moves on the infrastructure sector - from doubling the amount that can be raised through tax-free infrastructure bonds to 60,000 to customs duty relief for import of fuels like coal - could restart the much-needed investments in this sector. 
  
  The proposals on the capital markets side - the cut in Securities Transaction Tax, incentives under the Rajiv Gandhi equity scheme for first-time investors, and making electronic format mandatory for 10% of IPOs worth over 10 crore - are again small but directionally important steps. The raising of service tax rate to 12% was a bit of surprise, but perhaps unavoidable given the need to raise resources. But the move to a negative list will go a long way towards simplifying the process. His proposals on avoidance of tax evasion are very significant and could have long-term positive implications for the economy. 
  
  Admittedly, there were no 'big bang', headline grabbing reforms in the Budget. But the FM has done enough to rekindle growth and, more importantly, he has done it in an understated, credible manner that is unlikely to raise any political hackles and thus has a greater chance of success.

Founded in 2005 by Dr G Ganga Raju, son of Gokaraju Ranga Raju, the former chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam Party in Andhra Pradesh, Laila Nutra had revenues of around Rs 80 crore in FY 2014. The company is being valued at around ten times its sales at around $150 million, or Rs 900 crore. 

 “The company will sell around 40 per cent stake to private equity funds. It is also open to a strategic partnership. However, the strategic interest of multinationals in Indian nutra makers is low at this point of time,” a senior PE fund manager said. Laila Nutra has its manufacturing facility in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, and supplies these ingredients to its overseas clients such as US-based PL Thomas Inc and Interhealth Nutraceuticals Inc.

"South Mumbai Zaveri bazaar may soon move to a new address, experts proposes to relocate to Panvel",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/south-mumbais-zaveri-bazaar-may-soon-move-to-a-new-address-experts-proposes-to-relocate-to-panvel/articleshow/47020938.cms,m.economictimes.com,"South Mumbai's Zaveri bazaar may soon move to a new address, experts proposes to relocate to Panvel","MUMBAI: Zaveri Bazaar, the hub of India’s gold and silver trade in south Mumbai, might soon get a new address, just like the diamond trade which has been gradually relocating from the city’s congested Charni Road area to the much larger Bharat Diamond Bourse in the Bandra-Kurla complex.  	Negotiations are on between leading industry body India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), the state’s nodal agency for industrial development, for allotment of land to the trade. IBJA, consisting of 1,100 members, is proposing to shift either lock stock and barrel from the crowded Zaveri Bazaar to the city of Panvel, close to the proposed new international airport, or two nearby locations.  	The discussions began after IBJA approached chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who, in turn, asked MIDC to consider allotment of land around Panvel. “We have requested for around 500 acres to be allotted in Panvel, and will take a call based on the amount of land which can be earmarked for setting up a jewellery park, knowledge centre and accompanying facilities,” said Ketan Shroff, spokesperson, IBJA.  	Bhushan Gagrani, CEO, MIDC, told ET that Pavel may be short of land. “The association has approached us a couple of times. It’s a good idea but we don’t have 500 acres available in Panvel. Therefore, we have suggested two alternatives to them (IBJA) – Roha Mangaon where we are currently acquiring land, and Khopoli.”  	Currently, scores of jewellery manufacturers, gold refiners and bullion traders, operate out of the highly congested market at Zaveri Bazaar, where an estimated 40% of India’s gold trade takes place each year. “It’s highly inconvenient in terms of logistics, security, well-being of workers and ease of doing business. This has made it imperative for us to consider a new location,” added Shroff.  	At Khopoli, MIDC has notified the site for acquisition and setting up of an industrial zone. However, it has not started the land acquisition process as yet. Apart from these locations, the association has also suggested a separate site, also in Khopoli, to MIDC for land allotment.  	“We are currently considering all three locations. If the association is fine with Roha Mangaon site, we can allot the land in the next six months; other places may take longer. And, this will be allotted to them at compensation as per our norms,” Gagrani added.  	Zaveri Bazar is the country’s oldest jewellery market. The oldest outlet, Narandas Manordas, is over 200 years old. It also houses showrooms of reputed jewellers like TBZ The Original, Dwarkadas Chandumal, UTZ, etc.  	Until six-seven years ago Zaveri Bazaar accounted for 65% of the country’s bullion trade. But traders moved to Ahmedabad, India’s bullion capital, when the Maharashtra state government imposed stamp duty of 0.1% on gold and silver in addition to an octroi of 0.1% on gold and 2% on silver, according to Shroff. Ahmedabad imposes neither octroi nor stamp duty.  	Making Panvel a possible hub will do away with octroi and help the Mumbai Metropolitan region to reclaim the status of bullion capital. "
Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear. Do you agree?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/warren-buffett-once-said-that-gold-is-a-way-of-going-long-on-fear-do-you-agree/articleshow/48260855.cms,m.economictimes.com,Warren Buffett once said that Gold is a way of going long on fear. Do you agree?,"By Sahil Kapoor
 
 The world market was awash with a swarm of gold bugs after the financial crisis of 2008. Gold bugs are advocates of investments in Gold as a safe haven and a guard against financial Armageddon, hyperinflation, currency collapses and geopolitical troubles.
 
 A few years ago, gold bugs argued the precious metal was a can't-miss investment given the ultra-loose monetary policies around the world and the prospect of higher inflation.
 
 However, you can't find many gold bugs as the metal prices have taken a big tumble. The cumulative returns since 2010 for gold HAS almost BEEN nil compared to a return of 70 per cent by Dow Jones Industrial Average and 57 per cent by BSE S&P Sensex.
 
 The current outlook on gold is reflected in this quote by the legendary investor Warren Buffett.
 
 ""Gold is a way of going long on fear, and it has been a pretty good way of going long on fear from time to time. But, you really have to hope people become more afraid in a year or two years than they are now. And if they become more afraid, you make money, if they become less afraid, you lose money, but the gold itself doesn't produce anything.""
 
 One of the principal arguments in favour of Gold at the turn of the decade was the impending hyperinflation which would follow the massive money printing done across the world. This world economy is struggling with continued threat of deflation in Eurozone, anemic growth in Japan, the US and most of the commodity producers, causing benign inflation scenario.
 
 The steep decline in oil prices has added to this fall in inflation and has reduced inflation expectations further. Gold has historically performed fairly well in period of excessive inflation. The period of 2001 to 2008 saw gold multiply about three times, largely led by inflationary outlook and a weakening US Dollar.
 
 Post the financial crisis of 2008, Gold bugs advocated in favour of the ""catastrophe metal"" as a hedge against the then probable collapse of the US Dollar as a reserve currency. The adoption of Euro as a secondary reserve currency gained prominence and supported the gold prices further.
 
 The emergence of Chinese central bank as a buyer of gold to prop up its gold reserves created further demand for the metal amid the sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone in 2011 to 2012. As we stand today, the dynamics supporting the gold price have changed. They changed a few years ago when as a directional bet, we expected gold prices to soften to $1,000.
 
 Hyperinflation, safe-haven and a reserve currency - all these arguments seems to have taken a back seat for now. We expect these factors to continue to weigh on gold prices. A strong dollar and bearishness across commodities are what's really driving gold prices.
 
 
Gold losing safe-haven appeal:
 
 Despite all the global economic uncertainty, ""Gold's safe heaven thesis"" is not really playing out. Gold prices have remained relatively muted in response to the Greek debt crisis, which is an indication that markets have priced in the risk of sovereign default. Over the years, Gold has proved itself to be a safe-haven. However, that appeal has always been short-lived and dependent on the long-term effect of each risk-aversion episode.
 
 
Dollar Strengthening: 
 
 US Dollar has strengthened, largely led by a deep devaluating of Euro, JPY and GBP. This is a product of fresh credit easing introduced by Eurozne, Abenomics in Japan and continued easing in the UK. Many commodity-producing currencies have declined along with oil prices, giving a further fillip to US Dollar.
 
 Gold is priced in US Dollar and has an inverted correlation to it. The effect can be seen on gold prices. US Dollar Index (a measure of the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies) has appreciated 35 per cent since 2011 and in the same time period, Gold prices have declined more than 50 per cent from their peak of $1900.
 
 
Largest Gold Short Position in the COT Report's History:
 
 Speculators are holding the smallest net-bullish bet on gold since the US government data begins in 2006. Latest COT Report shows speculative gold shorts rose to just under 99,000 contracts - the largest level in the report's history. Additionally, the percentage of speculative shorts rose above 45 per cent, which is another COT report record.
 
 
Chinese appetite for gold mellowing down:
 
 The central People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced last week that bullion holdings rose to 1,658 tonnes as of the end of June, from 1,054 tonnes in April 2009. Despite the tonnage increase, Gold now accounts for 1.65 per cent of China's total foreign exchange reserves, against 1.8 per cent in June 2009. The number was much less than the perception of China holding more than 3,000 tonnes, which shows Chinese appetite for Gold is mellowing down.
 
 
ETF Selling: 
 
 ETF holdings have dropped considerably from their 2012 record high of 2,900 tonnes - roughly falling by a third. Gold ETFs worldwide today hold approximately 1,730 tonnes of gold. Sentiment toward Gold is now ""excessively negative"" and we see potential for the yellow metal to recover only once higher US interest rates are priced into markets.
 
 The breakout to the downside of the trading range suggests a fresh leg-down in prices is coming, and that this week's low of $1,085 in gold is not likely to hold. The next longer-term downside price target for gold is a major psychological support at $1,000. At domestic front, similar 8-10 per cent downside could be seen and we could see Gold prices bottoming out around Rs 23,000/10 gm in India.

"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/a-25-fall-in-crude-is-like-a-10-billion-stimulus-for-indian-economy-say-experts-top-stock-bets/articleshow/45121185.cms,m.economictimes.com,"A $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for Indian economy, say experts; top stock bets","NEW DELHI: India imports around 80 per cent of its crude oil needs, and a fall in the prices of the commodity provides the much needed relief for the country's deficits as the same brings down the import bill.

Analysts say that a $25 fall in crude is like a notional $10 billion stimulus for the Indian economy.

""Falling crude oil prices led to the implementation of the alignment of diesel prices to market rates. This enabled the government to ease subsidy burden. The money saved can now be channeled to some efficient economic projects,"" says Soumyadip Raha, Research Executive - Oil & Gas at Microsec Capital Ltd.

""The government is now mulling over the idea of bringing some of the benefits of lower oil prices to the government exchequer by way of hiking duties,"" he adds.

Further, Raha says that falling crude prices result in better realisations for oil & gas firms as it increases the income of the government from taxes.

Brent crude has seen a sharp fall in 2014 so far, down nearly 30 per cent, on the back of strengthening dollar that suppresses demand for oil and other dollar-priced commodities.

Brent crude has come down sharply to below $81 a barel in a matter of just five months from around $115 recorded in mid-June. This has already reduced the country's import bill significantly.

India's oil import bill for the last financial year stood at $150 billion.

India's net imports of crude amounts to about a billion barrels a year, and with every dollar decrease in oil prices the bill slips by Rs 4,000 crore, as per media reports.

""The fall in prices (of crude oil) will also lead to lowering of inflation and support higher growth. In turn, lower inflation, improvement in fiscal and current account balances will result in higher GDP growth,"" says Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.

""Yes, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the economy as it creates three-way effect on the economy. A fall in crude oil prices results in a drop in crude oil import bills, and thus the total current account deficit is reduced. This strengthens the currency also,"" he adds.

Gupta is of the view that a drop in crude prices will reduce government's subsidy burden as well as prices of petroleum products in the country would be lowered leading to ease in inflation.

Ravi Dharamshi, CIO, ValueQuest Investment Advisors, is of the view that we are going to benefit in a big way with the fall in crude. As someone else was suggesting, a $25 fall in crude is like a $10-billion stimulus for the Indian economy, he adds.

Slowing global demand, especially from the European countries and China, is one of the reasons for this massive decline in the prices of crude, say experts.

The slide in oil had a significant impact on inflation as consumer price inflation has cooled off to its lowest level ever, at 6.46 per cent in September. It has even created room for the Reserve Bank to ease interest rates sooner than expected.


	 


""The fall in oil prices has also provided a commendable stability to the rupee despite a rally in dollar index, thus attracting more inflows into the economy. Overall, the outlook for economic growth has improved,"" says Sugandha Sachdeva, AVP & Incharge - Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Securities Ltd.

As per another estimate, Sachdeva is of the view that a $10 decline in brent implies country's annual import bill falls by around $17 billion.

""Prices are expected to find a strong floor around $80 a barrel and may even retreat towards $88. Having said that, any breach of $80 per barrel would accelerate the fall and lead to a drift towards $75,"" she adds.

Top bets in the oil & Gas space:

Vivek Gupta,CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited

Investors should go long in OMCs like BPCL, HPCL, IOC we also seen have seen decent long build up (rise in open interest & rise in stock price) in these stocks. Our Top Pick is IOC, which is forming a good consolidation on weekly chart; overall trend of stock is up, investors can further enter long around 380 for the target of 440 & 460 in near term.

Nandan Chakraborty, MD-Institutional Equity Research, Axis Capital

The first thing to do when oil prices dip is to buy interest rate sensitives, and not the ones which depend on oil. It is pretty straightforward because if you look at oil marketing companies, as long as LPG and kerosene remain subsidized, they would not have too much of a slack in terms of increase in their profits.

Krishna Kumar Karwa, MD & CFO, Emkay Global Financial Services

As far as the oil marketing and refining companies are concerned, they are the prime beneficiaries of the diesel deregulation. So, we continue to be bullish on HPCL and BPCL.

From a longer-term perspective, I believe that the government is very clear about its policies as far as oil exploration is concerned. These companies should be a key beneficiary of that. They should also benefit from an increase in gas prices. So all in all, I think that these companies should give you very good returns in times to come.

Rahul Singh, Head of Research, Standard Chartered Securities

In the PSU & oil marketing companies, we are positive on Coal India as well and somewhere down the line even ONGC should benefit from lowering of subsidies may be in FY16, although clarity on that is still to emerge. So while PSUs as an asset class have run up and some of them have doubled-tripled, there is still some juice left in some of these companies. But you cannot just generalize.

Bottom-up stock-picking will become more and more important even within the PSUs. So you will have to differentiate much more between the oil marketing companies versus upstream versus GAIL and so on.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: What is your current market view?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Markets will remain range bound in the short-term. They are waiting for an earnings trigger because we saw a significant downgrade in the last quarter. As we get into this first quarter, the trend does not seem to change because the exit rate in the last quarter was very weak, especially on the top line growth but we are pretty confident that you should see a recovery in growth in the second half.
 
 We have seen some early signs of government spending picking up in the first month of this fiscal year. That is going to be the key driver. Government spending this year is going to be key in terms of kick starting demand and we see an impact of that probably in the second half coming through. After the correction, we have seen valuations turning out to be reasonable and any further correction because of global developments could be a good time to increase and add investments into equities.
 
 
ET Now: Yesterday, we saw Tech Mahindra come out and say that the next quarter is not going to be as great. Now, this is something that we have seen played out even in the last quarter when it was almost a blanket profit warning signal from most IT majors. This time too do you sense that this could be more of a sectoral trend rather than just a company specific one? Would the IT sector better avoided for now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: There were cross currency movements in the last quarter, which impacted the dollar growth for most companies. That impact will not be so severe in this quarter because we see some mean reversion over there but in case of the specific company, which you mentioned, I do not think it is an issue across the sector. It is probably the telecom space, where it has a larger footprint, which will result in some slowdown. However, on a broader scale, things are not that bad. In terms of guidance, Cognizant has shown an improvement.
 
 
ET Now: So stick to large cap IT because Infosys, TCS, are sounding reasonably confident for FY16, but what about smaller companies such as KPIT or MindTree?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The IT industry is going through a transition phase where compared to earlier times and material contracts, they are getting more into digitalisation and companies able to do that transition into the digital world are the companies, which will be able to get such an increment because that is where this trend is headed and that is where the incremental orders are.
 
 
ET Now: If indeed the government is going to spend in the first two quarters of the current half of the current fiscal, would the markets start discounting?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: The government spending essentially would be in areas like infrastructure which will be in say roads, railways and agriculture etc. These are the areas where you will see not only the central government but the state government because there is a lot of allocation to the state governments this year in the budget and how the state spend also would be important.
 
 So, as we see order flows coming in especially in the road sector, that would lead to some indication. At least it might not reflect into traction down the line because this month is a monsoon month. Activities levels will be a bit low but slowly that money would start to trickle down, get in the hands of various people, consumers. Urban consumption Will start to pick up slowly.
 
 
ET Now: So when you say consumption, considering it is such a large umbrella, what are people going to consume more? More pizzas? Are they going to buy more shoes, more branded clothes or is it going to be cars and other such things?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Currently, what we are seeing is a transition. That is why overall growth is not looking that great. As that inflexion point happens and we are seeing some early signs of that, obviously the demand would be more on the discretionary side. Consumer staples is where the growth is still going to be bit sedate but as your job creation happens, as disposable income increases, as interest rates go down a bit, we do not expect much but at least another 50 bps. We should see demand for all these consumer discretionary products to pick up.
 
 
ET Now: Why do you think demand will pick up, why are you bullish on urban consumption?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: It is not just interest rates which are going to make a big difference. Obviously, interest rates coming down will mean that your EMIs on mortgages will come down. That will mean some amount of savings, which you can spend but more importantly it is going to be demand in terms of job creation. Secondly, because of lower inflation, your real wages are much stronger than what it was earlier so that will slowly lead to pick-up in consumption. We are not expecting any big pick-up but at the margin these are the trends, which we are observing.
 
 
ET Now: Do you sense a renewed vigour in Indian pharma, which is largely exposed to the United States? I am looking at your holding and you do not have too many pharma names. Have I got the holdings right or you genuinely do not have pharma name?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: No, we are neutral on pharma. We have got some of the leading top large cap pharma companies in this portfolio. The pharma companies have had a very good run. Lately, we have seen some kind of product approval delays in a few companies and some correction. The valuations of Indian pharma story continues to look great. They appear good from medium to long term perspective.
 
 The valuations in some of the companies had really gone up very high and there were some near term concerns in a few names. However, the broader long term trajectory in terms of growth in the Indian companies in the US generic space and lot of the companies are also now clearly getting into complex generics, which is slightly higher. So, we think that the growth in this sector should be around 15 per cent to 20 per cent, which is pretty good so we are not negative, we are neutral on that sector.
 
 
ET Now: So you expect the market to be range bound for the next few odd months, what could snap out of this range and what is the biggest risk for India right now?
 
 
Mahesh Patil: Clearly, monsoon was something, which we were looking at. It has come in pretty good at least for the month of June. One has to see how the onset is in the next few months or so. On the reform side, we have the next monsoon session beginning and expect some development regarding GST. We do not expect much to happen on the Land Acquisition Bill but GST is something, which we would like to get implemented in the next fiscal year because you require these kind of triggers for the market especially at this point in time when growth is still illusive. So these are some of the factors, which one would look at.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: Our most awaited reform which could have an impact on Indian economy is GST. Assuming that GST would be in place in next 12-15 months, markets would start buying into those sectors well ahead of time. With this assumption, which are the stocks one should buy?
 
 
Deven Choksey: In general, we believe that the GST roadmap will be spelled out in this particular budget. Whether it would get across the board implemented in all the states at one go remains to be seen. However, even if it is getting implemented, it is a process that wille take about one and a half to two years to fully materialise as far as the books of the companies are concerned from the point of view of bringing down the cost structure. The tax structure which will come down because of the rationalisation through GST should benefit most of the consumption oriented businesses before anybody else. Hence, to a greater extent, the focus should remain under the consumption space. Given the kind of possibility in the economy of growth coming back above 6 per cent in the next 12 to 15 months, we believe that automobile sector would probably lead the show at this point of time. Also, automobile sector could possibly have major benefits because of a likely possibility of the bank rate coming down and if interest rates starts coming down, then it would be a double benefit to many of the auto companies. Typically the commercial vehicle segment which have still not moved up as much as the other vehicles or passenger vehicles like Maruti and other companies, I would think that Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland kind of companies within the auto space should remain in the favourable list given this possibility along with the likes of Bajaj Auto which would also remain quite comfortably placed as far as the growth is concerned. This is also due to the export oriented perspective they have. Hence, within the auto space, we like these three. We believe that the consumption space would largely get favoured with the roll out of GST going forward.

Harsh Mariwala in no hurry to pass on the baton of Marico to his children Rishabh & Rajvi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/harsh-mariwala-in-no-hurry-to-pass-on-the-baton-of-marico-to-his-children-rishabh-rajvi/articleshow/32684847.cms,m.economictimes.com,Harsh Mariwala in no hurry to pass on the baton of Marico to his children Rishabh & Rajvi,"MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: Harsh Mariwala isn’t ready to pass on the baton of Marico, a Rs13,500-crore (market cap) consumer goods firm, to the next generation. Not that he isn’t keen, but he would rather wait for a few more years.
 
 Mariwala, who stepped down as Marico managing director on Tuesday, said it’s too early to say if his children Rishabh and Rajvi will eventually be at the helm of the company that he started some 40 years ago. “It’s still too early to come to any conclusion and we will wait and watch as to what pans out. You cannot predict everything in life,” he told ET.
 
 As ET reported in its Tuesday edition, Mariwala passed on the day-to-day operations of the company to CEO Saugata Gupta who has been elevated as MD. His son Rishabh, 33, had spent three years developing business at Marico’s beauty salon services arm Kaya Skin Clinic before starting a premium handmade soaps company in 2009. Almost around the same time, Mariwala’s daughter Rajvi, 34, too opted out of Marico — she was a part of its brand-building team — to focus on sociological research.
 
 
 
  Mariwala, 63, said the firm does not intend to deviate from its strategy of a having a professional management to run its operations and expand the breadth of its products and services. He said the move to promote Gupta was a natural process and not a sudden decision. “Saugata will be in complete control, in charge of managing the overall business,” Mariwala said, adding that all key division heads will now report to Gupta.
 
 Over 43 years ago, Mariwala quit the crowded traders lane on Masjid Bunder in Mumbai with an ambition to make his two highly commoditised products — edible and coconut oil — national brands. Today, Parachute and Saffola are among the biggest oil brands in India, and Marico has about 20 brands across 25 markets. That is what Gupta, 45, has got to manage and grow.
 
 Mariwala’s mandate to Gupta is clear — drive top line growth in existing and new value-added products and capitalise the combined international and domestic business to become far more profitable. But the market environment isn’t very favourable. Copra prices are at all-time high, with 76 per cent increase since last year.
 
 Also, Marico has been underperforming the market by posting less than 5 per cent volume growth for Parachute and single-digit growth for Saffola since the last few quarters. The company admits that short-term pressures will always be there and the key challenge in the long term is to move beyond oil and succeed in value-added portfolio. Gupta said the firm is trying to shift portfolios in favour of new categories such as oats, personal care and hair colour that contribute 20 per cent of its total sales.
 
 At the same time, there will be crosspollination between its international and domestic brands that will perhaps help the firm enter adjacent categories. According to analysts, while Marico maintains its market shares, sharp price increases in hair oils could keep volume growth under pressure in the future. “The company seems cognizant of poor returns in its past acquisitions and sub optimal return ratios and is looking at sustaining 30 per cent plus dividend payout,” Amnish Aggarwal, analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, wrote in an investor note.

"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/shreejit-mishra-two-others-quit-hul-stock-up/articleshow/8659741.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Shreejit Mishra, two others quit HUL; stock up","
  MUMBAI: Four senior-level executives at Hindustan Unilever have quit over the past few months after spending almost two decades with the country's largest consumer goods company. Among those who have put in their papers are Shreejit Mishra, executive director (Foods), N Rajaram, VP (Haircare & Lakme), Srikanth Srinivasamadhavan, general manager (Media Services) for South Asia, and Jayakumar Krishnaswamy, general manager for Supply Chain Excellence. Mishra was not available for comment, while Srinivasamadhavan declined to speak to ET. HUL neither denied nor confirmed the senior-level departures. 
  
  At 9:55 am, shares of Hindustan Unilever were trading 0.40 per cent up at Rs 304 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  Rajaram joined Bharti Airtel in March as its chief marketing officer, while Krishnaswamy joined Akzo Nobel as Director SCM, late last year after spending over 15 years at HUL in two separate stints.Replying to a detailed questionnaire sent by ET, an HUL spokesperson said, ""The attrition rate in HUL is significantly below industry level, at 5% per annum for the last four years. What we have is natural attrition, which is essential and healthy for all organisations in terms of both talent management and development."" Top officials in the know about these developments said a changing work culture at HUL and increasing job opportunities for HUL managers outside have triggered the exits. 
  
  ""Many of these managers have been in the same role and designation for over three years now. HUL is on top of Polman's list, and his directive that managers will have to spend longer tenures in their existing roles to ensure consistent business strategy, may have also triggered the move. The internal target of around 20% sales growth every quarter is adding to the pressure on HUL managers,"" said another senior HUL official. When Paul Polman took over as Unilever CEO in January 2009, the company was under pressure as customer spend on branded products had slowed down. Polman, the first outsider to head Unilever, injected some aggression into the group - including at its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever - and put in place a performance culture across companies globally, linking rewards to results. 
  
  Brand managers were also asked to report on 30-day schedules, adding to the pressure to perform consistently every quarter. 
  
  The results are now visible at HUL, which has been witnessing 13% volume growth for the fiscal ending March - the highest in over a decade, despite a large base of nearly Rs20,000 crore in sales 
  
  Mishra, who is HUL CEO Nitin Paranjpe's batchmate, is the most high-profile exit. He joined HUL in 1987 as a management trainee and moved up the ladder to become a member of the core management committee. Four years ago Mishra, then VP Activation-Asia AMET, Unilever and based in Singapore, was made Executive Director (Foods). During his tenure, the processed foods division has grown 67%, from Rs 538 crore in 2007 to Rs 900 crore today. 
  
  Watchers say HUL's managers are much sought after in the corporate world. ""It's good to see HUL managers becoming ambitious. The company has always been a good training ground for managers to perform well in other companies across sectors,"" said Kannan Sitaram, operating partner at India Equity Partners, who spent over two decades with Unilever. ""In the last few years, HUL's pyramid was getting narrower at the top, influencing some managers to take up top jobs at other companies"".

Emcure Pharmaceuticals withdraws proposed IPO,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/emcure-pharmaceuticals-withdraws-proposed-ipo/articleshow/36353156.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Emcure Pharmaceuticals withdraws proposed IPO,"NEW DELHI: Emcure Pharmaceuticals has withdrawn its proposed initial public offer, which was looking to raise up to Rs 500 crore, making it fourth withdrawal this year. 

 The Pune-based pharma company had filed draft offer documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the proposed IPO in June last year. 

 The proposed issue comprised of fresh issue of up to Rs 300 crore and an offer for sale of up to 25,13,057 equity share. 

 However, the company through its lead merchant banker IDFC Capital withdrew its offer documents on June 6 this year, as per the latest update available with Sebi. 

 The pharma company intends to utilise the net proceeds for setting up of new manufacturing facilities and expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, research and development and general corporate purposes. 

 The company is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing a broad range of pharmaceutical products globally. 

 Emcure Pharmaceuticals operates nine manufacturing facilities, eight of which are located in India and one in the US. 

 Prior to Emcure Pharmaceuticals, three firms --Trimax IT Infrastructure and Services, BSCPL Infrastructure and GMR Energy-- had withdrawn their respective public offer plans this year so far.

Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-it-will-be-a-tough-task-for-vishal-sikka-to-revive-infosys-back-to-its-glory/articleshow/36430060.cms,m.economictimes.com,Why it will be a tough task for Vishal Sikka to revive Infosys back to its glory,"The mood on bourses appears to be not so encouraging after the announcement of Infosys to appoint Vishal Sikka as CEO and MD. After a firm opening on Thursday, the stock came under selling pressure. It had lost 2% on NSE by 11am. The big worry for investors is whether it’s too late for Sikka to be at the helm and whether the current issues facing the erstwhile industry bellwether can be surmountable.
 
 Sikka has to wade through following major challenges and that would be easier said than done:
 
 1. 
The growth conundrum- Infosys has added a significant number of new clients, 238 to be precise at the gross level, in the four quarters to March 2014. This is higher compared to its peers. However, this did not culminate into higher revenue growth. Infy’s sequential revenue growth lagged that of its close peers including TCS and Cognizant and a smaller peer, HCL Technologies.
 
 2. 
The changing nature of deliverables- The global IT outsourcing industry has shifted from traditional wage arbitrage to multi-year, deals that are capable of transforming the business. This includes remote infrastructure management (RIM) services. At present, Infosys derives over 7% revenue from RIM compared with peers who earn 12-34% revenue from this segment. RIM has shown a higher growth over the past few years compared with the traditional services. This makes it necessary for Sikka to focus on improving Infy’s exposure to this segment.
 
 3. 
Higher employee attrition rate- Infosys has not been able to tame the rate of attrition in the past few quarters. Attrition was 18.7% during the March 2014 quarter compared with 16.3% a year ago. This is also higher than 11.3% for TCS and 16.9% for HCL Tech. Talent management and retention will be a tough task for Sikka.
 
 4. 
Sliding profitability- Infosys has long been following what it coined as quality growth in the form of industry-best margin profile. But this has changed over the past few quarters as the company reported a sharp fall in operating margin. In the March’14 quarter, it reported operating margin was 25.5% compared with over 30% in the March’10 quarter. During the said period, both TCS and HCL Tech improved their profitability. Sikka will have to strike a fine balance between growth and profitability as he scouts to bring the company back to its glory days.

Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/association-of-mutual-funds-in-india-warns-members-to-stay-away-from-suspicious-ready-forward-certificate-of-deposits/articleshow/32817251.cms,m.economictimes.com,Association of Mutual Funds in India warns members to stay away from suspicious ready forward certificate of deposits,"The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has asked its members to desist from suspicious ready forward deals in certificate of deposits (CDs). In an e-mail to fund houses a few days ago, AMFI chief executive HN Sinor also warned that the market regulator wants to end this practice as it leads to asset management companies risking investor money. 

 “Also, desist from entering into undesirable trades/transactions, which are not in conformity with regulation,” Sinor said in the e-mail, reviewed by ET. Sinor asked the fund houses to furnish daily transaction date to CRISIL/ICRA, the rating companies that provide daily CD quotes. ET had on March 12 reported that some asset management companies were doing CD trades at a pre-fixed rate, which were perceived to be violating norms while increasing the risk for investors. The financial mechanism, known as “parking” or “river crossing” or “holding period return”, is generally seen towards the end of a financial year and involves four parties — the issuer of CDs, the ultimate subscribers, cashrich entities such as banks and companies that provide parking space, and the intermediaries. 

 The latest AMFI communiqué came after the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) sought clarification on such practices in an e-mail dated March 21. “Some fund houses complained to Sebi to stop recurrence of this unhealthy practice. The regulator spoke to AMFI on this and later, official e-mails were exchanged,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. 

 In its reply to Sebi, AMFI assured of maintaining “best practices” among fund houses. It wrote, “The parking phenomenon……. leads to funds buying assets at yields higher than the then prevailing yields in April.” 

 Mutual funds, the biggest buyers of CDs, face redemption pressure in their liquid funds from lenders that need money to expand credit. At this point, some intermediaries or brokers connect some cash-rich entities, be it banks or corporates, which extend funding support to MFs by temporarily buying the three-month CDs at typically 9.60% to 9.90% range at the fag end of March quarter from issuers.

Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/infibeam-mulls-filing-draft-red-herring-prospectus-by-december-as-it-gears-up-for-its-ipo-next-year/articleshow/44953953.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infibeam mulls filing draft red herring prospectus by December as it gears up for its IPO next year,"NEW DELHI: Ahmedabad-based e-commerce company Infibeam plans to file its draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by December as it seeks to make its market debut next fiscal amid increased inflows into the country's consumer internet businesses.
 
 Infibeam, which owns and operates e-commerce venture Infibeam.com and B2B e-commerce platform BuildABazaar, is looking to raise about Rs 500 crore -Rs 1,000 crore through its initial public offering (IPO), while targeting a market capitalisation of Rs 3,000 crore-Rs 4,000 crore.
 
 “Investor interest continues to peak when it comes to strong internet businesses in India that have shown consistent growth, and I think we are well poised to capture that,“ said Vishal Mehta, founder and chief executive of Infibeam.
 
 Infibeam, which sees about 80,000 transactions across its platforms, has targeted a revenue of Rs 500 crore and gross merchandise sales of about Rs 2,000 crore for the current fiscal.
 
 The IPO, expected in 2015, will make Infibeam the first Indian e-commerce company to go public in the country. HomeShop18, which has al so announced plans to go public, has filed documents to list on the US exchanges.
 
 Infibeam, which has appointed Axis Bank to be the lead book runner for the IPO, is looking to list on both the National Stock exchange and the BSE.
 
 The developments come at a time when consumer internet companies, while receiving increasing funding from private equity and strategic investors, have also begun to receive significant attention from the country's retail investors.
 
 “There will be an appetite and there is no reason why we won't see the same trends as in the US or China,“ said Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital, a leading investment bank.
 
 Local business listings website JustDial's public market flotation in May last year saw a strong response from investors, with the company raising about Rs 950 crore in the process. The company's market capitalisation on Monday stood at Rs 10,200 crore.
 
 Matrimonial venture BharatMatrimony.com has also signalled its intention of going public by the next financial year, which could see other consumer internet companies follow suit.
 
 Infibeam, which is yet to raise any foreign institutional capital, may also look to sell a portion of its equity through private placements ahead of its planned IPO. Mehta, however, did not disclose details, stating that the company was still in discussions.
 
 Foreign investors have purchased a net $34.99 billion of stocks and debt until October 21 this year. In 2013, India's stock market received a net foreign fund inflow of $20.10 billion while the debt market saw an outflow of $7.97 billion, stock exchange data showed.
 
 “The Indian market is looking at the consumer internet space, but while it may accept the business model, it may not accept companies that continue to make losses. That is the gap which has to be addressed,“ said Garg.

Niftys still holding the momentum: Nirmal Bang,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/niftys-still-holding-the-momentum-nirmal-bang/articleshow/6806263.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Nifty’s still holding the momentum: Nirmal Bang,"
  The Nifty started the earlier week on a bearish note, as fair amount of liquidity was pulled out of the system for the Coal India IPO. The Nifty ended the week at 6066; almost flat compared to the previous week’s close. 
  
  FIIs bought Rs 1,893 crore worth of shares in cash while local institutions sold worth Rs 1,388 crore India VIX, which measures the immediate expected volatility, and saw a weekly high of 23.9 and closed at 21.61. 
  
  We saw highest build-up of Calls at 6200 followed by 6300 (for the October and November series). We expect this activity to continue as the market gathers a bullish undertone. Highest Put build-up was seen at 6000 strike. PCR-OI for the October expiry is at 1.18, while that for the November expiry stood at 1.24. Higher PCR for November is purely a function of hedging activity; with majority of Put build-up seen at strikes below 5900. It should not be construed as a bearish signal.
  
  Overseas growth data to be watched for will be US home sales, employment data and advance estimates for US 3Q-GDP. Back home, we will have WPI data being reported on the expiry day. Technically, the Nifty has not given any signs of topping out and is still holding the momentum. Fresh round of selling could be seen only if the Nifty hits a new bottom of 5930 and trades below this level. 
  
  Till then, we continue to maintain ‘buy’ on every decline. Fresh round of buying could be seen, if the Nifty holds above 6115, then the next target could be 6220-6330. The market will continue to consolidate in the range of (5900-6200) with extreme volatility on the cards, as metal majors JSPL, Sterlite and SAIL report 
  earning this week. 
  
  Strong support is seen at 6010 levels. We observed very high Call IVs at ATM strikes for Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Hindalco and ICICI Bank hinting these scrips may see a run-up from their current levels.

Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/euro/usd-looking-at-support-between-1-3815-30/articleshow/34377220.cms,m.economictimes.com,Euro/USD looking at support between $1.3815-30," 	Euro Summary  	Euro-dollar closed in NY Monday at $1.3853 after rate had corrected away from highs of $1.3879 to $1.3840 into the European close before it drifted higher through the US afternoon. Rate touched an early low of $1.3849 in Asia before picking up fresh demand that lifted it to $1.3865 ahead of the European open. This recovery/buoyant tone continued into Europe as rate pushed on to $1.3872, holding back at $1.3865 into the release of Saxony CPI data. The m/m release showing a fall of 0.1% prompted sales to $1.3860 but with the y/y coming in at 1.3% (up from previous 0.9%) saw buyers quickly emerge into the dip to take it up to retest Monday's high at $1.3879. Rate eased away from this level, with the correction given an added shove from release of soft Italian retail sales, ECB M3 data and soft German states' CPI. Rate found support at $1.3855 (61.8% $1.3840-79) before bouncing back to $1.3870 as Germany NRW CPI came in above expectations. The euro was holding firm in late morning trade, with continued talk of Russian interest to buy euros in dips. Resistance seen at $1.3879/85, ahead of $1.3900. Support $1.3850/40.  	EUR/USD  	Still failing to break significantly through the 76.4% Fibo retracement at $1.3876, maybe been a couple of points higher, at this stage. Now looking to support from between $1.3815-30 to hold this decline, or risk a much deeper fall and the possibilty of a double top around $1.3878. While intact, we can see another attempt higher, $1.3904-$1.3977 the immediate target zone above. Below $1.3815 and the Apr 22 low at $1.3786 becomes key.  	Sterling Summary  	Cable closed in NY Monday at $1.6810 after rate had posted multi year highs at $1.6858 on the back of demand prompted by confirmation from US Pfizer of its interest to buy UK AstraZeneka. However, talk of an Astra price tag rebuttal, along with Pfizer stating that funds for such a takeover are mainly held offshore, weighed back on sterling, which along with release of stronger than forecast US house data pressed cable to session lows of $1.6801. Demand between $1.6805/1.6795 cushioned the move. Early Asian trade was contained within a tight $1.6807/10 range (trade very subdued due to the Tokyo holiday; start of Golden Week) before it lifted to $1.6817, settling between $1.6813/15 into Europe. Reported euro-sterling stops above stg0.8250 targeted in opening Europe trade, the rate pushing to stg0.8252 before reversing to stg0.82255 as sterling picked up decent demand on positioning ahead of UK GDP release. Positive press comments by BOE Carney provided an added boost as cable traded to $1.6846. However, data came in just under forecast and sterling was sold to $1.6792/stg0.8259 but buyers quickly emerged to take cable back to $1.6820, the cross to stg0.8245.  	GBP/USD  	Rally through $1.6841 has been curtailed by the swing target at $1.6857 so far. Subsequent decline has to hold above $1.6790-95 support, in order to retain current upside momentum. Loss would put recent $1.6779-$1.6765 lows under pressure, beneath which $1.6713-$1.6662 come back into the picture. While near term supports hold, then we can challenge $1.6857 again, with $1.6881-$1.6918 still the target zone above.  	Yen Summary  	Dollar-yen witnessed a very subdued Asian session with trade tied to a narrow Y102.47-54 range. The cross opening around Y141.97 made a show through Y142.00 on the back of triggered stops in euro-aussie, before stalling ahead of tech resistance at Y142.16 (61.8% of Y143.45-140.08). Traders await the BOJ policy meeting and press conference tomorrow for further market direction. Demand via the crosses improved appetite in early Europe, lifting the pairs to Y102.55/Y142.25 and a break of tight overnight ranges. Euro-yen triggered stops on the move before momentum stalled and drifted lower. Release of German Saxony CPI which came in lower at -0.1% m/m initially slipped to Y142.12, before a stronger y/y reading countered the move, spiking to Y142.27. Second wave demand with added support from a strong sterling-yen move took the cross on to extended highs of Y142.45. Mixed CPI readings from Brandenburg, Hesse and Bavaria followed and with added weight from soft eurozone M3 data, pared light gains. A stronger North Rhine CPI looked to re-test intraday highs, however the move lacked conviction to settle in narrow range trade. Dollar-yen tracked early moves and spiked to Y102.67, the rate holds firm with offers seen into Y102.70.  	USD/YEN  	The move through Y102.40 on Monday should now give us another look at Y102.72. Above and we head for Y103.15-Y103.45, an area which includes two projected targets, as well as Fibo retracements. May well be tough to break above here at this stage. Support in the meantime has moved up to Y102.20-30 and a loss here on the day would be a disappointment and suggest the recovery was struggling again. This would bring Y101.88-98 back as key support below.  "

 With this, as many as 104 companies have been listed on BSE SME since the launch of the platform in March 12, 2012. Of these, six companies have migrated to the exchange's main board. 

 As on date, BSE SME platform has helped the listed SMEs raise nearly Rs 756 crore from the capital markets. 

 The BSE SME platform helps SMEs raise funds to meet their business needs. 

 Of the five companies -- Gala Print City, M D Inducto Cast, Loyal Equipments and Jiya Eco Products -- are based in Gujarat, while Majestic Research Services & Solutions is located in Karnataka. 

 Noting that there were thousands of potentially good SMEs that should list on capital markets, BSE Managing Director and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan told reporters that 20-25 companies are expected to list on SME platform in the next 2-3 months. 

 ""In this fiscal, 100 more SMEs are expected to hit the markets,"" he added.

S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sp-upgrade-may-drive-fii-debt-flow/articleshow/43764215.cms,m.economictimes.com,S&P upgrade may drive FII debt flow,"MUMBAI: The foreign fund flows into Indian debt instruments may turn into a tide with investors gaining confidence after Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook for India to stable from negative in line with other international rating companies Moody’s and Fitch. 

 Standard & Poor’s move last week, owing to the new stable government at the Centre that the company will prove conducive to reforms, came at a time when foreign holding limits in government bonds are nearly exhausted and overseas investors are turning to corporate debt, bringing borrowing costs of companies lower even as the Reserve Bank of India wants to keep rates high. 

 “The change in S&P’s outlook will only strengthen global investors’ favourable long-term outlook towards India,” said Neville Fernandes, head of debt capital markets at Citi India. “The confluence of low interest rates, tight credit spreads, abundant liquidity and favourable investor outlook for India presents a very attractive financing opportunity for Indian corporates.” 

 India’s rating of BBB-minus is the lowest in investment grade, below which is the ‘junk’ category where investors are normally wary of investing. 

 Till August this year, foreign institutional investors or FIIs have net invested Rs 1,02,473 crore in Indian debt securities compared with net sales of Rs 50,848 crore in 2013. 

 FIIs are fast exhausting their limits or caps set for investing in Indian debt securities. They have already utilised nearly 97% of the $25 billion earmarked for government securities while they have exhausted 66.50% of the limit for long-term investments in government bonds for more than five years. 

 Overseas investors have of late turned to corporate debt segment capped at $51 billion. So far, they have exhausted about 46% compared with 35% on June 2. 

 Since government limits for regular FIIs and foreign portfolio investors or FPIs are practically filled, enquiries are increasingly coming in for corporate debt investments, said Ananth Narayan, regional head of financial markets at South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank. 

 According to dealers, some of the actively traded corporate securities include top-rated Rural Electrification Corporation, Power Finance Corporation, Food Corporation of India, HDFC Ltd, L&T and UltraTech. 

 The yield spread between government and corporate bonds has contracted 15-20 basis points in the past few months, suggesting fall in corporate bond yields. Yield and prices move in opposite direction. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. 

 “In September alone, so far we have seen high inflows of about $1.5 billion, which could be a record high. In terms of pricing, corporate issuers would be benefited due to higher demand,” said Lakshmi Iyer, senior vice president and head of fixed income and products at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management. 

 Acting as custodians, two multinational banks have in the past few weeks added 15-20 institutional clients each from Europe for investing in India. Large institutional investors like Pimpco, BlackRock, Warburg Pincus, Fidelity and Fairfax are expected to step up their bets in Indian debt securities, dealers said. Last month, foreign fund Franklin Templeton had bought bonds worth about Rs 16,000 crore in the largest single-day purchase of Indian government securities. 

 “The ratings revision encapsulates the positive sentiment on India, but more importantly takes us a step closer to a game-changing rating upgrade for India. We believe large institutional investors will continue to invest,” said Amit Bordia, head of corporate Finance at Deutsche Bank India. 

 Some foreign central banks and long-term pension and insurance funds from Southeast Asian and European countries are also expected to ramp up their investments with lot sizes of Rs 200-500 crore each.

Unless DLF really gets past significant levels something like 250 on the upside, no significant rally is going to start. You will have some up days, some down days, that is all, the stock has become extremely flat.

ET Now: I am intrigued to understand what is driving Wockhardt. Fundamentally, there is a challenge. The business is not growing. US FDA problems are not over. Yet, the stock on strong volumes has appreciated from 450 to 700.
 
 
Deven Choksey: Yes, at times, it would surprise us for sure. Not every company would probably fit into the M&A kind of a story that we are talking about. Even I am sure that Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy probably must have done a good amount of due diligence before buying into the Ranbaxy. So to a greater extent, applying the same yardstick to every company would be wrong but yes, the market has a mind of its own. Probably they have some different way of looking at Wockhardt. I am not totally sure as to what are the kind of stories that they are playing around with. But yes, where exactly the growth comes from in this company is an intriguing question.
 
 So we would not get into this particular company. We would rather stay with the likes of Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy, the likes of Cipla, the likes of Glenmark, or Lupin in the pharma space.

Similarly with Welspun Corps there must be some news but these moves need to be sustained and it needs to move up much higher at least 15% to 20% higher, so from here you need to cross those 90-95 type of zones before you can say that this has bottomed out.

US stock futures edge higher before jobs data,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/futures-edge-higher-as-tech-stocks-rebound-private-jobs-data-on-tap/articleshow/93907513.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Futures edge higher as tech stocks rebound, private jobs data on tap","US stock index futures edged higher on Wednesday as technology and growth stocks snapped back, while investors waited for private payrolls data to gauge how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to tame decades-high inflation.

 The three main indexes are set for sharp monthly declines, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 4% after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's blunt and hawkish remarks on Friday about keeping monetary policy tight ""for some time"" quashed hopes of more modest rate hikes.

 Meanwhile, mixed economic data signaling easing price pressures and strong labor market has weighed on investors' mind heading into September, which is a typically a weak month for stock market returns.

 The benchmark S&P 500 is up 9.6% from its mid-June lows but remains in bear market after plummeting earlier this year.

 ADP National Employment report, due at 08:15 am ET, is expected to show private payrolls likely increased by 288,000 in August. It will be followed by a reading on Chicago PMI for August after market open.

 On Tuesday, data showed U.S. job openings rose to 11.239 million in July, pushing stocks to close lower for a third straight session.

 It also comes ahead of the more comprehensive and closely watched jobs data for August on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 300,000 jobs last month after rising by 528,000 in July.

 Any signs of a cooling job market would be welcomed by markets as that could ease the pressure on the Fed to stick to outsized rate hikes.

 Heavyweight technology and growth stocks such as Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc and Nvidia Corp, which took a beating in last few days due to a surge in Treasury yields on rate hike prospects, rose between 0.6% and 0.8% in premarket trading.

 At 07:07 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 25 points, or 0.08%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.26%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 83.75 points, or 0.68%.

 Chewy Inc slid 10.9% after the online pet supplies retailer cut its full-year 2022 sales outlook and warned about softer demand for discretionary products.

United Spirits could have the best risk-reward ratio,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/united-spirits-could-have-the-best-risk-reward-ratio/articleshow/34068378.cms,m.economictimes.com,United Spirits could have the best risk-reward ratio,"The timing of Diageo’s open offer at Rs3,030 per share of United Spirits, just a little before the Whyte & Mackay (W&M) sale and prior to the national elections, is interesting, given the low premium on offer and the fact it would allow certainty of control to Diageo. Investors should consider accumulating the stock at the current level, given some of the triggers for the company, going ahead.
 
 The positives that could play out in the next few quarters include cash from Whyte and Mackay sale, new CEO and the premium story. USL could have the best risk-reward ratio for the next few months. The upside can be significant, and the downside limited, irrespective of the election outcome (due to the open offer which will begin in June), analysts say. “Diageo is our top pick due to several catalysts in the stock,” said Manoj Menon, consumer analyst, Deustche Equities.
 
 
  
Whyte & Mackay Impact 
 
 The company is expected to complete the W&M asset sale in the next few months after concerns on competition raised by the UK Office of Fair Trade. The company has hired Standard Chartered, Rothschild and Rabo Bank as advisors and it’s understood that the bids have already come in. Although the bid prices are not known, analysts value W&M at £350-700 million (Rs3,500-7,000 crore).
 
 “If the value realised for W&M is around £700 million, this will unlock value for United Spirits, wipe out its entire debt and increase its long-term return ratio profile,” said Arnab Mitra of Credit Suisse in a recent report. He added that W&M value unlocking could be a major trigger for the USL stock and at a valuation of £650 million, the EPS upside could be almost 45.2 per cent for FY15. At the end of September 2013, its net debt stood at Rs7,100 crore with over two-thirds of the company’s operating profit going towards debt servicing.
 
 
Lowest Open Offer Premium
 
 The offer is about 18.5 per cent higher than the floor price (26-week average price) of USL, one of the lowest among open offers in two years. This is despite Diageo seeking control of United Spirits. Last year, HUL had launched open offer at 23 per cent premium and GSK Consumer Healthcare at 37.2 per cent to the floor price. Both the stocks are now trading above their offer prices.
 
 “We are advising clients to buy the stock as, among large-caps, it has the best risk-reward ratio,” said a sales official of a leading multinational brokerage on condition of anonymity. “There is a possibility that Diageo has kept a buffer and may increase the open offer price after talking to institutional investors, who may not tender at such a low premium.”
 
 
Diageo on USL
 
 In November 2012, when Diageo acquired USL at Rs1,440, the investment was expected to be economic profit positive in six years. Despite more than doubling the price (Rs3,030 now), Diageo claims the investment would be economic profit positive in seven years. “There has been a significant rerating of the Indian consumer goods story, given the promise of renewed economic buoyancy and other macro positives,” said Deirdre Mahlan, CFO, Diageo, in a recent interview.
 
 This reflects an upward revision in earnings estimates by Diageo for USL. “We do not expect a full acceptance for the offer and believe longer term investors will wait for the premiumisation theme to play out in USL,” said Harit Kapoor of IDFC.

United Bank raises $350 million under MTN programme,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/united-bank-raises-350-million-under-mtn-programme/articleshow/34091523.cms,m.economictimes.com,United Bank raises $350 million under MTN programme,"MUMBAI: State-owned Union Bank of India (UBI) has raised $350 million by selling offshore bonds as part of its $2 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme. They will be listed in the Singapore Exchange. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. 

 These bonds of five-and-a-half year maturities come with a coupon rate of about 4.50%. The bank has arrived at such pricing after adding a 280-basis point spread over and above the 5-year US Treasury, which is currently trading in the range of 1.70-1.74%. The effective yield has come around 4.54%. ""The entire fund will be used for offshore operations,"" a senior bank official told ET, adding that rates offered were a win-win for both the investors and the bank. Institutional investors across Asia, Europe and the Middle-East have subscribed to the issuance. 

 UBI has sold bonds through their Hong Kong branch. These offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase were the investment bankers for the issue building. The securities are rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors while S&P, another global rating company, has assigned a BBB- to the issuance. 

 Almost two weeks ago, the State Bank of India (SBI) had raised a total of $1.25 billion by selling bonds in two maturities: five and ten years. The five-year bond was priced at a spread or gap of 205 bps over the 5-year US treasury, which would be equivalent to a yield of 3.62%. This is significantly below than the Union Bank of India's spread at 280 bps. ""Being the largest Indian lender SBI commands premium among investors, who always consider the bank as quasi-government bond. The rest state-owned banks do not enjoy the same,"" said an investment banker.

 Sudip Bandyopadhyay: Well, it is going to continue much longer, in fact our view is that rubber prices are not going to start going up in calendar year 2015 also, probably calendar year 2016 will see rubber prices going up so there is still long way to go. 

 In the entire tyre pack, people have not looked at Balkrishna Industries in a very serious manner. This is one counter in the tyre space which one needs to look at current levels, it is an excellent company exporting to 120 countries. India being their manufacturing base, definitely in terms of cost advantage, it has huge advantage over global majors. Europe is their main market, US they have not developed that much but that is potential and I would not be surprised if it crosses 600 in the near future, maybe six months to nine months time.

However, Texmaco’s operating profit margin fell 230 basis points year-on-year (YoY) to 13.9% for the December ‘09 quarter and that’s despite a 43.4% growth in net sales to Rs 238.8 crore. Pressure on the company’s operating margins was due to key raw material costs as a percentage of net sales which rose to nearly 440 basis points YoY to 79.8% in the third quarter of FY10. The company’s key inputs include steel and allied products, and according to various estimates, domestic steel prices are higher by nearly 11% YoY in the third quarter, as domestic steel prices are quoting at a premium of 8-10% compared with the landed cost of imported steel. The company’s net profit was Rs 22.2 crore for the third quarter, a rise of 44.2% YoY, helped by lower interest costs and higher turnover. The quarterly results of Texmaco were declared after the close of trading on Wednesday, but the stock had declined 0.9% to Rs 162.5. However, over the past six months, the Street has been optimistic on the growth prospects of the company, and this stock has surged 94% compared with a 30.7 % rise in the Sensex during this period. In the case of Titagarh Wagons, its stock price had also risen 40.8% over the past six months. Texmaco had recently raised nearly Rs 170 crore through a QIP and it plans to use the funds raised for modernisation of its manufacturing units.

We are currently going through a phase of long term unusually low volatility. So this is a bull market but the moves are small. So we have been creeping up for quite a while and at the moment it looks that is exactly what we are going to continue doing for a while. Sure, in that light where do you think leadership will come from for the markets? Which are the stocks within the index which are looking the strongest on the charts right now for you? Well, this particular rally has once again got the same leaders that the past rallies have got, that is auto leading particularly Tata Motors and Mahindra not doing badly either this time and metal stocks have also once again picked up that momentum. The new sector which has not always been there in rallies but looks promising right now is cement, that sector is also doing quite well. Coming on some of these metal stocks that you feel attractive at this point in time from the metals pack. There is a good move happening as we speak in Sesa Goa. It is towards the high of the day. This little dip in the market has not affected it. So that looks quite a strong stock but even the Tata Steels are not very far behind. There is a good amount of momentum there. Hindalco has also made a good move. So it is across different metals as such. Sterlite has also been quite strong. So it is an overall wide base metal rally and as has often happened when the market is an intermediate uptrend, the metals go up. The only thing to look out for in metals is once there is an intermediate downtrend, they do tend to correct quite heavily as well. Stock specific to you, JP Associates, just announcing those cement despatch numbers up 60%, stock is showing some up move today as well. Yes, the stock has been a little quiet before today in the last two three weeks since this rally started gaining force but it is doing a bit of a catch up now and it is also at the high of the day. So this is reasonably promising but it is not at its bull market high. So the longer term trend in this stock is not that well established say auto or some of the other sectors. Question on cement, two specific stocks, UltraTech Cement and Binani Cement, both up close to 6% in today’s trade. Well, to take Binani Cement first, this has crept up really to the, it is the bull market high at about 75. It has come up there once or twice and then reversed. So now what has got to be seen is whether it stabilises above this level. If it does then it is onto a new bull market high which is really an affirmation that it is partaking in the bull market and in a strong uptrend, so that is really what is to be looked for over here. Apollo Hospitals? Apollo Hospitals if you look at the stock, it is for here’s and there’s it has tended to remain in a range. So as far as the long term is concerned of the stock, there is really very little happening here. Short term it makes sporadic moves and today would fall in that category. The very long term range in this stock has been something around 350-700 which it is approaching the top of until there is a breakout because it has not managed to do this since 2003. That is what we got to look for. Wheels India, that is up 20% today, is it looking good for more? This is not really that heavily traded a stock, so when you get a move which after days and months of inactivity takes place, one would not read too much into it but the interest today is definitely there. Today’s volume is perhaps higher than that of the last 8-10 days put together but this would not be the sort of move that I would get interested in this stock because it is a one off situation but somebody holding the stock should certainly hold onto it, it is up at the circuit and it is good payoff if people had been holding onto this stock patiently. From a trading angle, a short term target on MTNL given the momentum? Well, it is only now that there is some interest in this stock. It is first of all in the wrong sector. That sector has been doing very poorly and this stock has been of considerable disinterest to traders, its volumes have dropped but last three or four days, there is some momentum building up. If it is somebody is very speculative about it maybe, take a position, see what happens a day or two ahead but there are better options around. Ideas that you think look interesting, give us at least two of them for tomorrow morning? Well, continuation of the closing today, so Sesa Goa which I just mentioned earlier, that has had a good close and Tata Motors is always a very safe bet in a rally. It tends to be among the leading index stocks, so these two should be able to maintain where they have finished. I would not go with fertiliser yet because they were not doing very much before today. So I would wait for them to correct first and then look at buying them. You would avoid fertilisers, that has been established. You still want to monitor the momentum that we have seen in today’s session but aside of that, the other strong midcap movers whether it was the auto component space, the auto majors, some sporadic moves coming in on BOC India and the likes, what would be your pick, what is one trading position that you would carry forward into tomorrow?The problem at auto ancillaries is that they do not trade very heavily. So if you are looking for stocks which have say a futures contracts or so attached, you do not get too many auto components but if you look at the stocks as such, they have been doing pretty well right from the tyre industry to axels or any other auto components. So the auto sector is obviously giving them a boost, so anybody holding any of these stocks, they have good long term ideas and definitely need to be in there. The other sector not mentioned at all today but as budget approaches and since fertiliser is making the moves could be the rail stocks because already the volumes have picked up in all the Kalindee’s, (15:23) and Texmaco’s, so they could also be once again in the running before the budget."

Ashwani Gujral: I think that can continue even till the 9th or 10th of this month because a lot of the rally that we have seen in cyclicals is kind of a hope-fuelled rally. And while it is nice to be hopeful, you would be much better off trying to enter stocks which have a) corrected and b) will benefit from a stable government. The tech stocks are going to benefit because they turn cyclically. So, a move up is probably round the corner. All the froth has gone, most people have gotten out of their tech stocks so this is a good time cyclically. People will get into the space because if something goes wrong the CNX IT will very quickly get back towards 10,000, and then these stocks will hedge your positions if you are planning to go long into the elections. So that way PSUs will do well. People are continuously building positions in PSUs regardless of the verdict. In any case, they are so dead and beaten up that they can only move higher. So probably the next week could be good for them.

Dipan Mehta: Coming to IT, the safe stock to buy would be Tech Mahindra and something more risky could be Zensar Technologies as the number over there are pretty impressive in terms of what they achieved in last quarter.

  What is the call on large cap IT stocks?
   
  
  Sudarshan Sukhani: The rally that we saw in large cap IT stocks is probably over which is the reason why I have added TCS to my short selling list after a long time. We are going to see lower levels in all of them. Infosys has already begun its correction, Wipro has done it. 
  
  So the 2 stocks left are TCS and HCL Tech. Both will correct. The chances are that their correction will be relatively shallow but for TCS we can look at 900 to 950 and that would be an attractive level to enter it.

"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tcs-signals-slowdown-brokerages-remain-unfazed-retain-rating/articleshow/32290558.cms,m.economictimes.com,"TCS signals slowdown; brokerages remain unfazed, retain rating","NEW DELHI: After Infosys, India’s largest software company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has signalled that the March quarter is typically slower for them than the Dec quarter due to seasonality and fewer days.

Hence, Q4FY14’s QoQ revenue growth could be lower than the October–December quarter (Q3) at 3%, but “this should not be any indication of slowdown in demand,” clarified the management.

The management, however, has reiterated that the FY15 revenue growth would be higher than FY14, led by improvement in discretionary spending in the US and market penetration in Europe.

Key takeaways from TCS analysts meet highlighted the fact that near-term commentary remains soft, but the management retains its positive discretionary spend-led FY15 outlook.

TCS expects Q4 to be softer than Q3 in CC terms, growth to be led by Europe and Latam, and India to decline. But the management is confident of a strong outlook for FY15 over FY14. Margins, however, are likely to drop 40-50bps QoQ due to investments.

However, analysts at top brokerage firms are of the view that revenue growth will be seasonally low in the upcoming quarter, but overall trends look positive and currency will play a small role in Q4. But investors who want to remain invested in the IT space for long term should look at accumulating the stock on dips.

“Margin impact of currency fluctuations and reinvestments would likely be 40-50bps in Q4FY14. We adjust our FY14-15 estimates as per management commentary, but maintain our rating on TCS,” Barclays said in a note.

Barclays has incorporated the management commentary in their forecasts and consequently lowered their FY15-16 EPS estimates by 1.0 per cent. The global investment bank has revised its target price to Rs2,275 and maintains ‘equal-weight’ rating on the stock.

Earlier in the month of March, Bangalore-based Infosys spooked the street after chief executive SD Shibulal told investors the company was expecting to end the current fiscal year only near the lower end of its 11.5-12% guidance.

Reacting to the news, most brokerage firms reduced their respective target prices for Infosys. BofA-ML, Deutsche Bank and Barclays reduced their respective 12-months target prices by Rs 200-300.

But analysts are more confident this time on TCS and see more of a temporary phase for the company as management still remains confident about global operations.

Analysts expect the IT major to outperform industry on revenue growth as management commentary on demand trends for FY2015 continued to be reassuring, led by a favorable demand environment and market share gains.

“We expect TCS to outperform industry on revenue growth due to its superior market reach and excellent execution capabilities. We expect TCS to grow its USD revenues at a CAGR of 16.5% over FY2013-15 and EPS at a CAGR of 25% during this period,” Angel Broking said in a report.

	 
TCS has executed well over the past many quarters and currently trades at 18.5x FY2015E EPS. The Mumbai-based brokerage firm believes that TCS’ premium multiples are well deserved given consistency in performance and leadership in growth/profitability. They maintain their ‘buy’ rating on the stock.

Here are the views of five global brokerages firms on TCS post analysts’ meet:

Barclays:

The global investment bank has incorporated management commentary in their forecasts and consequently revised their FY15-16 EPS estimates downwards by 1.0 per cent. Their numbers imply 4.5% US$ revenue CQGR for FY15E compared to 3.6% witnessed in FY14.

Barclays’ revised the price target is Rs 2,275 (based on 18x weighted average of FY15-16E EPS) and they continue to maintain ‘equal-weight’ (EW) rating as they find valuations fair.

Goldman Sachs:

Goldman Sachs has maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2122.55. It says EBIT margins should remain in a stable band, though we may see some impact (40-50 bp) as TCS continues to make investments in the business through penetrating newer geographies, service lines. Hence, it has maintained that margins may stabilize in the 27%-28% band in the long term.

Citigroup:

While Q4 is likely impacted by seasonality, management commentary on demand trends for FY15 continued to be reassuring. Expectations/valuations in TCS are the highest in the sector, and there could be limited upside from these levels. For investors who are looking for some upside in IT sector, Citi prefers Wipro and HCLT among the Tier 1 stocks.

Their target price of Rs 2,350 is based on 20x Mar'15E EPS. Citi estimates TCS' earnings will grow at a 23% CAGR over FY13-16E, and believed the stock should trade closer to the higher end of its historical five-year trading range of 7-24x 12-month forward earnings.

Morgan Stanley:

MS remains overweight on the stock. The global investment bank believes that management commentary about a weaker 4Q will keep expectations low going into the results. Overall, Morgan Stanley believes muted expectations for 4Q are unlikely to lead to any material change in the Street’s FY15 earnings expectations. The stock is trading at a premium to its peers (~19x FY15e and ~16x FY16e EPS), that could be sustained over the coming quarters.

Religare Institutional Research:

TCS valuations, though at a premium to the sector, have moderated to 19x FY15E earnings. Predictable growth and the ability to navigate margins will support TCS’s premium over the sector.

An improvement in demand outlook and continued execution would be the key stock triggers. Religare maintains ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,450.

Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/tax-free-bonds-regain-demand-in-the-secondary-market/articleshow/48059129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Tax-free bonds regain demand in the secondary market,"MUMBAI: Tax-free bonds which have been languishing for more than six months due to lack of investor interest in the secondary market, are in demand again.
 
 High networth individuals and some institutional investors are willing to invest in the instrument via the secondary market as they expect new tax-free series to offer lower rates on the back of expected fall in the benchmark yield and the odds for more rate cuts by the central bank have increased.
 
 “For HNIs wanting larger allocation, secondary tax frees will make sense, if there is some supply,” said Himanshu Bhagat, managing partner at IIFL Wealth. “Here (secondary market), we can then see some limited yield correction.”
 
 During 2013-14, Rs 49,200 crore of tax-free bonds were sold with rates offered in the range of 8.01-8.76% for 10-20 year maturities. Two years earlier, bonds worth Rs 48,000 crore were offered at a wide range of 6.82-8.30%.
 
 A week ago, the government mandated seven top-rated state-run companies to raise Rs 40,000 crore this financial year. Issuers are expected to start bond sales from this month-end in a phased manner. Sizable issues are expected in October-March, the period people plan their tax saving and have funds to invest.
 
 “HNIs and some cash-rich corporates are now keen to take bets on tax-free bonds via the secondary market as yields may fall five to 10 basis points,” said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income at Edelweiss Financial Services. “The new series could offer lower rates following the expected fall in the benchmark yield.”
 
 The benchmark yield on Monday rose six basis points to 7.86%, pushing prices down as an additional Rs 10,000 crore bond supply by the Reserve Bank of India added to the supply-side this week.
 
 But, good rains along with macro parameters will leave more rooms for the central bank for rate cuts this financial year. Lower interest rate in the market would pull bond yields lower. Also, the latest Greece debt deal has put a lid on speculation that the debt-ridden country would exit the European Union and prompt a market turmoil.
 
 On an average, the benchmark yield is expected to fall to the 7.50% level in the next three to six months, dealers said.
 
 Going by the incumbent benchmark yield as of now, an investor can earn as high as 7.25-7.5% by investing in the new series of tax-free bonds with 10-15-20 year maturities. Tax-free bonds will be priced after adding 45-80 basis points (varies on investor class and security rating) to the yield of similar-maturity sovereign bonds.
 
 “If the existing secondary market tax-free bond yields are near the 7.10-7.25% levels, it makes sense for HNIs (investing above Rs 10 lakh) to invest a portion of their money"", said Rupesh Bhansali, head-distribution at GEPL Capital.
 
 In the secondary market, 10-year triple-A rated tax-free bonds are yielding 7.15-7.25%. On 15-year paper, the yield is 7.25%.
 
 Yield on the National Highway Authorities of India’s 15-year tax-free bond has fallen five basis points in the past three weeks. Since the beginning of the financial year, this paper has seen transactions 15 times until July 9.

Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/tata-steel-q4-show-beats-estimates/articleshow/35138490.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Tata Steel Q4 show beats estimates,"MUMBAI: Tata Steel reported a consolidated profit of Rs 1,035.8 crore, beating market expectations, helped by higher sales volumes and better realisations in Europe and India. 

 Analysts, on an average, were expecting Tata Steel to report consolidated net profit of Rs 970.9 crore on sales of Rs 40,791.9 crore, according to a poll conducted by Bloomberg. The company reported a loss of Rs 6,529 crore during the same period last year, hurt by impairment charges. Sales rose 22% to Rs 42,428 crore from the same quarter last year. 

 Sales volumes grew to 7.6 million tonnes (MT) compared with 6.6 MT during the same quarter last year. Tata Steel board has recommended a dividend of Rs 10 a share for FY14. 

 Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortization (EBITDA) was Rs 4,917 crore from Rs 4,368 crore during same quarter last year. EBITDA per tonne rose in India and Europe but fell in South-East Asia. 

 Tata Steel Europe CEO Karl-Ulrich Köhler said that the Europe business is focussing on operating costs and will look to reduce costs through more internal measures. He acknowledged that the company continued to see pressure on margins. 

 “Europe is suffering from overcapacity, which means pricing power is limited. Since there was a decrease in raw material prices, the benefit of which will come with a lag effect, customers asked for lower prices,” Köhler said. Global iron-ore prices have fallen sharply in the last three months, putting downward pressure on steel prices. 

 Tata Steel Europe, known as Corus before the $13-billion buyout in 2007, accounts for more than half of Tata Steel’s total consolidated revenue. 

 The company, which has been severely hit by recession and overcapacity, has remained operationally positive for five straight quarters, driven by several restructuring measures and a slight uptick in demand in Europe. The company indicated at more restructuring in the coming year. 

 ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, showed ‘cautious optimism’ about the recovery in the continent about the business outlook for the rest of 2014, when it reported quarterly results last week. 

 Tata Steel is India’s largest private sector steelmaker by revenue. It has a production capacity of about 10 MT per annum in Jamshedpur and about 18 MT in Europe. The company is increasing steelmaking capacity in Kaliganagar, Odisha. The project will add about 3 MT in the first phase of expansion. 

 Koushik Chatterjee, group executive director, said the Kaliganagar will be commissioned this year. The company has already spent Rs 16,350 crore this year. However, on the impending interim order by the Supreme Court on illegal mining in Odisha, the company remained non-committal. “Each company has to be treated on merit. We are operating with all clearances. But as all good companies we have a plan B in place,” said Chatterjee. 

 He refused to elaborate on the plan. Gross debt rose to Rs 81,000 crore as on March 31, 2014 from Rs 76,500 crore three months back. On refinancing of debt, Chatterjee said: “it will happen, when it has to happen. We’ll take a call when it’s due.” Shares of the company jumped to a 22-month high and closed up 6% at Rs 452.15 per share on BSE on Wednesday.

  TOKYO: Shares in Japan's Suzuki Motor soared nearly five percent Wednesday after a newspaper report that it plans to shift part of its engine production abroad due to the strong yen.
  
  The automaker gained 4.91 percent to 1,945 yen in the afternoon, boosted by the report in the Asahi Shimbun.
  
  However, Suzuki denied the story, saying it had no plans to reduce its annual production of 800,000 engines for vehicles assembled at factories in Japan for domestic sales and exports.
  
  ""We have been saying we want to replace shipments of parts to Hungary and Indonesia to build engines there with local procurement, considering the yen's strength,"" a company spokesman said.
  
  ""The engine output (in Japan) will not be reduced from 800,000 unless domestic demand falls,"" he said.
  
  Nonetheless the Asahi report encouraged buying.
  
  ""It's positive in the sense that the company will be able to better address the impact from the stronger yen,"" a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm told Dow Jones Newswires.
  
  The manager added the Japan's monetary easing Tuesday also led to buy-backs of Suzuki as investors had recently been cautious amid worries of overheating in the fast-growing Indian market, in which it boasts a 50 percent share.
  
  The company also faces increased domestic competition as Toyota Motor announced plans to enter the mini-car market.

  This follows a deal where Mr Maran in his individual capacity agreed to acquire 37.7% stake in Delhi-based budget airline from the promoter of the firm besides financial investor Wilbur Ross for around Rs 739 crore. He will have to shell out Rs 479 crore to buy the additional 20% stake.
  
  The open offer price is at 4.7% premium on the Monday’s closing price of Rs 55.15. The domestic airline, which now has permission to fly overseas to Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal, witnessed hectic trading of shares which soared over 6% in early morning trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It touched an intra-day high of Rs 59.55, only to close 1.61% lower from the last traded price on Friday. The open offer has been made by Kal Airways, a private firm promoted by Mr Maran and his wife Kaveri. It will open on August 6 and close on August 25.
  
  The new promoters propose to change the name of SpiceJet after completing the acquisition, which is expected to close next year. They also plan to shift its registered office from Gurgaon in Haryana to down South.

  It has been into a very strong downtrend for quite a while and slammed down into supports near the 41-42 area. We did see a very large volume upside move from the lows today. So it is very clear that there are interests in buyers somewhere in the 40 to 42 region and that would remain a decent level of support to buy in. 
  
  I would not really chase this stock but looking at the very strong decline that we have had, certain bit of an upward bounce is not unrealistic and since the stock has been into a lower top lower bottom formation from somewhere in let’s say 97 levels to 42 levels, a decent pullback is on the cards. Stock is a decent bet, your risk levels are very close by. So with a target of about 65-67, this is a buy.

 Even after excluding the one-off income from sale and leaseback of aircraft and engine warranty claims, the Chennai-based airline has reported profits, mainly due to higher passenger traffic. Moreover, the performance follows five consecutive quarters of losses. 

 SpiceJet recorded a net profit of Rs 54.6 crore for the June quarter, compared with a net loss of Rs 71 crore a year ago, on the back of a 26% growth in passenger traffic. 

 The airline also witnessed a significant improvement in revenue per passenger, to Rs 4,068 from Rs 3,283 a year ago, which helped its net sales grow 51% to Rs 1,406 crore in Q1. Going ahead, it would be vital for SpiceJet to boost regional connectivity.

ET Now: NBFCs what do you do you speak to any company a small cap company like TFCI which in the investor conference yesterday guided very well. You were speaking to Capital First and the management comes on air tomorrow to speak about their future and they are sounding positive as well. Similarly for an SKS Micro. So almost every NBFC is talking very positively for the next couple of years at least. Do you have any preferences in this space do you like them at all? 

 
Dipan Mehta: I have mentioned on this channel as well that we have a preference for SKS Micro and within the NBFC space, there is a great deal of potential but investors are better off trying to venture into NBFCs which are specialised like SKS Micro into Microfinance and then there is Bajaj Finance and other company which we have an interest in.
 
 The same with Capital First which is more into SME funding. So wherever there are specialised NBFCs ,those will benefit because of the underlying volume growth that they are able to achieve, another segment of the NBFCs which is very interesting and lots of ideas over there would be the housing finance companies starting right from LIC Housing to Repco. 

 So on the whole, we are quite positive on the NBFC sector and they have demonstrated good growth rates, some amount of regulatory overhang also has got discounted with the new RBI norms for NBFCs. We have checked a lot of the companies are not getting affected as much as was thought earlier. So on the whole, it is great going for NBFCs and from shareholder point of view over the next three-four years.

As opposed to this, cement realisation of companies in the rest of the country has been erratic and in most cases, it has fallen.   	After following operational discipline due to overcapacity for a long time, south-based cement companies increased cement prices given the scope of new demand following the creation of two new states -Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is anticipated that there would be an incremental cement demand of 23 million tonnes (MT) which is higher than 20 MT which united Andhra Pradesh had during peak cement cycle.  	As a result, cement prices in south increased by Rs 20-50 per 50 kg bag in the September quarter. In contrast, with the exception of western region -where cement prices jumped in the range of Rs 20-40 per 50 kg bag - cement prices in North, East and Central regions have either declined or remained range bound due to weak demand.  	At present, cement utilisation in the South is in the range of 55-58% as opposed to 80% in the rest of India. As momentum in demand picks up in the region, cement prices are expected to rise in the coming quarters. 	 	 	 "

Dipan Mehta: The last two-three quarters have been quite spectacular for Sintex and after all the sort of internal changes in their business division, they have begun to focus more and more on the more profitable businesses. They have cut down on their working capital expenditure and on the whole the overall uptick in the economy also seems to benefit companies like Sintex Industries.

The overseas subsidiaries had been hit hard by the economic turmoil over the past 18 months, but have now started looking up. However, following the company’s failed attempt at acquiring Geiger Tech in Germany, which filed for bankruptcy, Sintex is likely to write off its initial investment of E7 million (approx Rs 46 crore) during the current financial year.For the December quarter, the company reported a 3.4% growth in consolidated net sales to Rs 848 crore. However, rising raw material costs impacted its operating margin leading to a situation where its PBDIT is now below the year ago level. The company shaved off close to one-thirds of its interest costs by replacing high cost loans, which helped its pre-tax profit inch up 3.5% to Rs 98.8 crore. Its textiles business grossly underperformed during the quarter with a 6% dip in sales and 67% fall in profits. In comparison, the plastics segment performed well with a double-digit profit growth against the year-ago period. Sintex Industries’ December 2009 quarter financial performance failed to impress investors, as its shares dipped 0.8% to close at Rs 269 on BSE. The scrip, which has underperformed the Sensex during the past year, is now being valued at 12 times its consolidated earnings for the past 12 months.The company reported improving capacity utilisation rates across businesses, which can help boost higher revenues, going forward. With over one-thirds of its annual profits typically generated in the last quarter, the March 2010 quarter numbers could be substantially better. The company is also carrying a war chest of around Rs 800 crore of cash, initially raised to fund an acquisition, which could add an unexpected boost to growth."
"Cost cuts, reworked deals boost Siemens margins",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/cost-cuts-reworked-deals-boost-siemens-margins/articleshow/34415149.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Cost cuts, reworked deals boost Siemens’ margins","Internal controls appear to be paying off for Siemens, the Indian arm of Europe’s largest engineering company, Siemens AG. Its focus on cost controls and better project management is reflected in its financials.
 
 The company’s operating margins in the first half of FY14 improved to 6.5 per cent against the last six-quarter average of 3.7 per cent, though revenue growth slipped by 7 per cent.
 
 Siemens India’s financial year ends in September. In the past few quarters, the firm posted divergent margins, from as low as 1 per cent in the third quarter of FY13 to as high as 13 per cent in the second quarter of FY12.
 
 Analysts believe the main reason for such variance is its high exposure to currency risk.
 
 The company imports most of its raw material. Besides internal controls to boost margins, the company is also re-negotiating with its customers on price.
 
 Post the March earnings, the management stated there’s still significant amount of under-cutting to grab orders, and the difference between the lowest bidder and the next possible one ranges between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
 
 Adding to the woes of capital goods firms are the trade terms, which seem skewed in favour of the buyer, resulting in stretched payment schedules . The company says it will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and ignore lossmaking orders.
 
 The attempt by the firm to focus on profitable volumes has led to a slide in order inflow growth as it stays away from loss-making orders. The order inflow declined by 4 per cent to Rs 4,620 crore in the first half of FY14 against Rs 4,790 crore in the same period last year.
 
 It continues to see a decline in order inflow from infrastructure and energy, which contributed 48 per cent to total revenue in the March quarter. The order backlog stands at Rs 12,900 crore at the end of March 2014.
 
 Despite the stock appreciating by 41 per cent in the last six months, 73 per cent of analysts tracking it, have put a ‘sell’ call on it, influenced by its P/E ratio.
 
 According to Bloomberg, earnings per share (EPS) for the next year is expected at Rs 16.23, which means the stock is currently trading at a P/E of 47.5 times of one-year forward earnings.
 
 Given the headwinds of a demand environment and cut-throat competition, a 47 times of P/E for a stock like Siemens India appears to be quite expensive for investors. On earnings, net profit climbed 185 per cent to Rs 88.29 crore in the March quarter, while revenue declined by 8 per cent to Rs 2,706 crore on a y-o-y basis. The drop in revenue is mainly the result of clients deferring deliveries.

It closed 5% up at Rs. 408.10 on Wednesday after reporting its second consecutive quarter of net profit, after remaining in the red for the previous three.
 
 For the October-December period, the firm posted a net profit of Rs. 22.4 crore against a loss of Rs. 2.9 crore a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to Rs. 139.8 crore.
 
 Instead of cutting back or waiting for the external climate to change, Shreyas increased capacity, while simultaneously reducing cost per tonne of cargo. It sold two old vessels and replaced them with newer, larger and more fuel-efficient ships.
 
 “The strategic and decisive actions by the board resulted in this strong turnaround. Newer vessels and better capacity utilisation on higher cargo from transshipment and domestic market helped,“ said chairman and managing director Ramesh S Ramakrishnan.
 
 Shreyas did not attribute the turnaround to any significant rise in demand, but mostly to its internal change in strategy . It increased capacity utilisation by venturing into non-container cargo, like steel coils. That helped it increase utilisation of empty vessels on return journeys. The company hopes to buy more vessels going forward.
 
 Last year rating agency Crisil had expressed concern about volatility in bunker costs and slow growth of container traffic in India resulting in low utilisation of its fleet. Both these issues have been resolved to a great extent by falling fuel price, more efficient vessels and higher utilization rate.
 
 ""It is not a recent story. The company has been able to consistently improve its earnings in the last three quarters. Even the first quarter for the year would have been profitable without a one-time expense,"" said an analyst, who refused to be named. Shreyas' market cap stands at Rs. 268.83 crore.
 
 Coastal shipping — which commands a significant share of trade in the US, China and Europe — accounts for just 7% of the country's total domestic cargo transport network even as India has a coastline of more than 7,500 km.

  How do Shoppers Stop, Educomp and Bajaj Hindustan look on the charts?
  
  Once the budget is over, Educomp generally tends to decline but now it is broadly in the range of about Rs 400 to Rs 520. 
  
  On Bajaj Hindustan, upside seems to be limited. Most of these stocks were showing good momentum but now are broadly range bound between about Rs 60 and Rs 80 on Bajaj Hindustan. 
  
  There was a news expected on retail which never came through. So, Shoppers Stop has been ranging between Rs 320 and Rs 380. In case it is able to close below Rs 320, you probably may find levels of Rs 260, but generally it is a low volume stock and does not tend to do much but below Rs 320. There could be some Rs 40-50 downside.

SBI raises $100 million from 5-year offshore bonds,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/sbi-raises-100-million-from-5-year-offshore-bonds/articleshow/46709305.cms,m.economictimes.com,SBI raises $100 million from 5-year offshore bonds,"MUMBAI: State Bank of India has raised $100 million, or about Rs 626 crore, by selling five-year bonds to international investors as it plans to expand offshore credit. The bank’s London branch has raised the bond issue rated as BBB-. 

 Deutsche Bank was the sole investment banker for the issue, which was priced at 2.83%. The coupon is derived after adding 144 basis points over and above the five-year US treasury yields. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. 

 Praveen Kumar Gupta, DMD and CFO, SBI, has confirmed the matter. “This was a foreign borrowing for lending overseas only. It was through a normal borrowing route,” he told ET. 

 Those offshore bonds are called Regulation S where they may not be necessarily offered and sold within the US. With higher demand for Indian papers, the spread or gap, over and above the US treasury yields has contracted. However, US sovereign yields have gone up as prices have fallen with investors expecting US rate hikes sometime in June-July. 

 “We are getting an increased number of queries from institutional investors for Indian top-rated bonds,” said an investment banker engaged in offshore bond sales. 

 Earlier in February, India’s largest private sector company by revenue Reliance Industries raised $750 million by selling 30-year maturity offshore bonds. The yield spread was at 262.5 bps while US treasury yields had dipped to record lows as prices moved up. The final yield came at 4.875%. 

 Nearly two weeks prior to that, the company had mopped up $1 billion through similar bond sales but with 10-year maturity at 4.125%.

Mid- and small-cap stocks outperformed their larger peers in the special session, which is held to mark the beginning of the traditional new year.
 
 BSE’s Sensesx rose 63.24 points, or 0.24 per cent, to close at 26850.47. NSE’s Nifty gained 15.55 points, or 0.19 per cent, to close at 8011.45 on Thursday. Among the broadmarket indices, BSE’s mid-cap index gained 1 per cent and the small-cap index rose 1.5 per cent. Financial markets will be shut on Friday on account of Diwali. In commodities futures, turnover in gold and silver rose on the commodity exchange MCX.
 
 Usually, it is the trader community, which participates in the Muhurat trading session. They enter small token trades with an intention to book profits as making money in this hour of trading is considered auspicious. This could be the reason for the activity in mid-caps. But mid- and small-cap shares on the Muhurat trading session may not repeat their recent strong performance in Samvat 2071 as many of them are considered expensively valued after the recent rally. So far in 2014, mid-cap index has gained 44 per cent and small-cap index has gained 63 per cent.
 
 “In Samvat 2071, only quality stocks which are moderately valued will outperform the broader market and investors should not expect much from overvalued mid- & small-cap stocks,” said Nilesh Shah, MD and CEO, Axis Capital.
 
 Samvat 2070, which ended on Wednesday, has been a good year for the Indian stock market with its benchmark indices outperforming almost all the major global indices in both rupee and dollar terms. The Sensex has risen over 26 per cent in this period.
 
 Brokers and investors are expecting similar returns this Samvat as the government has embarked on market-friendly measures to bolster the economy. But the road is unlikely to be smooth. Global markets are facing stiff hurdles from the euro zone, where concerns of a recession have resurfaced.
 
 Also, the era of easy global money may be coming to an end soon with the US Fed expected to increase interest rates mid-2015. There are worries that the flood of foreign institutional investor (FIIs) flows, which pushed up stock prices, may ebb once the Fed tightens its monetary policy. Though central banks in Europe and Japan continue to keep interest rates at near-zero levels, investors are not sure how much of that money would flow into emerging markets like India.
 
 For Indian stocks, the next big event will be the Union Budget for the financial year 2015-16. Investors are expecting the government to step on the gas on the reforms process with key state elections out of the way.

Sabero's growth prospects appear attractive,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/saberos-growth-prospects-appear-attractive/articleshow/6030013.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sabero's growth prospects appear attractive,"
  The crop protection major, Sabero Organics Gujarat (SOGL), has done exceedingly well on the bourses following its improved financial performance. Its stock has more than doubled in a span of one year, way ahead of the benchmark Sensex performance.
  
  SOGL’s profit for the fourth quarter more than tripled to Rs 7.1 crore, despite a 3% dip in the net sales at Rs 96.5 crore. Operating margin saw a 300-bps improvement to 15% as costs of raw material consumed fell 28%. 
  
  The performance of its domestic business improved in FY10. Domestic sales for the whole year grew 40% to Rs 180 crore representing 42% of the total sales of the company as against just 34% last year. In the case of its exports division, the sales also grew in the Americas region while Asia, Europe and Africa reported a drastic fall in sales.
  
  The proportion of debt in SOGL’s capital structure also got reduced during the year on account of a 15% equity dilution over the year and an 88% growth in net profit. Its debt-equity ratio dropped from 1.03 a year ago to 0.71.
  
  With more than 240 product registrations, Sabero operates on a wide network of distributors and agents in 50 countries. The company has its subsidiaries in Argentina, Europe, Australia and Brazil, with Europe and Brazil being the main focus areas to obtain registrations. The company is further expanding its international presence in the geographies of Costa Rica, Venezuela, the Philippines, Guatemala, Cameroon and Argentina. 
  
  The company is currently in the process of setting up an export-oriented plant of technical active ingredients at Dahej in Gujarat with an estimated capacity of 2650 tonnes per annum by December 2010. The capital cost of Rs 55 crore will be financed by a combination of $9-million external commercial borrowings and internal accruals. 
  
  Also, the company plans to increase the capacity of its Chloropyriphos plant by 50% until September 2010. Moreover, it is set to launch two new fungicides and two herbicides in the first half of FY11.
  
  It has announced a final dividend at the rate of Rs 1.20 per share for the year, which works out to a dividend yield of 1.6% at the current market price of Rs 73. This is 5.5 times its trailing 12-month earnings per share. Given the company’s expansion plans, its growth prospects appear attractive for the future.

Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/steep-appreciation-in-rupee-to-lower-oil-subsidies/articleshow/16591247.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steep appreciation in rupee to lower oil subsidies,"MUMBAI: A steep appreciation in rupee is likely to help reduce India’s oil subsidies substantially. The rupee-dollar exchange rate recently dropped below the 200 day moving average (DMA), which is regarded as significant by technical analysts.
 
 A report by Emkay’s predicted the trend to continue further till the exchange rate reaches 51.9 — another 1.5% appreciation. This can knock off Rs 25,000 crore of under-recoveries for the petroleum industry in the remaining 6 months of FY13.
 
 Just a few weeks back India was looking at a fuel subsidy bill exceeding Rs 2 lakh crore or 2% of the country’s GDP. The recent increase in diesel prices, cap on LPG cylinders and tax changes is estimated to cut this down by Rs 25000 crore. But the recent rupee appreciation, if sustained, would knock off additional Rs 25000 crore from the under-recovery estimate over next 6 months
 
 The daily under-recovery of petroleum industry was estimated at Rs 498 crore for the second half of September 2012 in spite of the diesel price hike in the first half. This was at an average import price of Rs 6350 per barrel of India’s crude basket.
 
 Since then, the import price of Indian crude basket has fallen to Rs 5700 per barrel thanks to a 6.7% drop in international crude prices and 3.7% appreciation in rupee.
 
 
 
  
 
 Assuming this level remains stable through the remaining 6 months of FY13, the total under-recovery for the whole of FY13 — including Rs 84,000 crore for the first six months of the fiscal till September — would drop below Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
 
 The impact of such a drastic fall in subsidy bill would be improvement in risk profile of the country for foreign investors. This will lead to more forex flows and lead to a further improvement in rupee. Rupee’s appreciation would also make imports cheaper thereby tempering the domestic inflation, which is another economic challenge for the economy.

RIL has lined up large-scale capital expenditure plans in retail, telecom, and petrochem which is expected to boost operating profits in coming years.
 
 Shares of RIL have risen only 11.5% this year, underperforming the benchmark index. BSE Sensex has rallied 21.5% over the same period. On Saturday, RIL reported a consolidated net profit of almost $1 billion, up 13.7%, for the first quarter of the current financial year 2015.

  New Delhi: Rice procurement in the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS- October 2010-September 2011) by government agencies has crossed the mark of 200 lakh tonne (20mt) mark upto February 17 but is slightly lower than procurement same time last year.
  
  Official figures released on Friday said 2,13,09,532 tonnes of rice have been procured by the various government agencies upto Thursday, with Punjab leading the States. Buys by the state government stood at 86,33,706 tonnes of followed by Chhatisgarh and Andhra Pradesh at 27,82,753 tonne. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh bought 16,57,437 tonnes and 16,54,640 tonnes respectively.
  
  Food Corporation of India (FCI) had procured 21.88 mt of rice in the year-ago period. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) chairman and MD Siraj Hussain had estimated that government rice buys would reach 32 mt in the 2010-11 marketing year starting October this year, beating the target of 31 mt, despite drought in some parts of Bihar and UP. Compared to this, government agencies had procured 31.47 mt of rice in 2009-10 marketing year (October-September). According to the second advance estimates released by the ministry earlier this month, rice output is projected to surge to 94.01 mt this year against 89.13 mt last crop year (july-june). Last year, rice output had declined by over 10 mt due to drought in 2009-10 crop year.
  
   India, the world's second largest rice producer, produced a record 99.18 million tonnes of rice in 2008-09. Official data for rice procurement for the past 11 years shows the government agencies procured 18.228 million tonnes in 1999-2000, 21.28 million tonnes in 2000-2001, 22.129 million tonnes in 2001-02, 16.411 million tonnes in 2002-03, 22.828 million tonnes in 2003-04, 24.683 million tonnes in 2004-05, 27.656 million tonnes in 2005-06, 25.075 million tonnes in 2006-07, 26.305 million tonnes in 2007-08, 33.684 million tonnes in 2008-09 (24.869 million tonnes up to 16 March).

Recent buyouts to drive Religare's growth ahead,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/recent-buyouts-to-drive-religares-growth-ahead/articleshow/7512717.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Recent buyouts to drive Religare's growth ahead,"
  The performance of Religare Enterprises in the December quarter was disappointing. However, its recent acquisitions are expected to drive its growth in the coming quarters. The strong 74% growth in the consolidated revenue did not trickle down to profits since the company did not get support from its asset management and investment banking business segments. 
  
  Its lending business, which drives almost half of its consolidated revenues, saw the interest yields contracting. Coupled with rising interest rates, this led to a 42% fall in the net profit for the segment. Further, its subsidiaries re-ported a combined loss of Rs 87.4 crore. Therefore, the company re-ported a loss of Rs 98.5 crore against a profit of Rs 21.5 crore a year ago on a consolidated basis. However, the company is taking various initiatives to drive business growth. 
  
  Its key global asset management and investment banking divisions have seen a spate of acquisitions . For instance, the global asset management business acquired Northgate Capital and Landmark Partners in 2010. This has given the company access to assets under management of $11.3 billion (Rs 56,000 crore) along with greater capabilities in primary and secondary private equity, venture capital and real estate segment. Its investment banking business acquired three companies in the December quarter. 
  
  Besides providing geographical diversification, these acquisitions would help in reducing the turn around time in the regions . Investment banking business is relationship driven. Once the integration with the target companies completes, the company would be able to fully capitalise on the target’s relationships. This would help the company in generating profits at a fast pace. 
  
  Moreover, the effect of rising interest rates on its lending business would fade away, as almost 62% of its financing book is floating rate in nature. Hence, the increase would be passed on to the borrowers. While the company has invested heavily in its key driving businesses, the future growth depends upon how fast the company finishes the integration with the acquired companies.

In the past few days, a spurt in rains in western Rajasthan has accelerated pulses sowing in the state, kindling hopes of recovering pulses acreage deficit.
 
 According to the latest sowing data, the total coverage under pulses is 74.48 lakh hectare as against 89.34 lakh hectare last year in the corresponding period.
 
 Out of the overall deficit of 14.86 lakh hectare, Rajasthan alone accounts for 12.6 lakh hectare.
 
 “Rajasthan contributes 45% of the total moong production in the country. If pulses sowing picks up, we can recover the deficit in pulses. Moong, which takes only 2 months for harvesting, can be sown till August 15,” agriculture secretary Ashish Bahuguna told ET.
 
 The pulses area is also likely to replace the acreage targeted for coarse cereals, which is dismally down due to deficient rains in the major coarse grain growing states of Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
 The area under coarse cereal is 140.89 lakh hectare as against 175.14 lakh hectare last year. “Most of these areas will be covered by pulses and fodder crops. Farmers usually divert to going pulses and fodder crops if nothing grows as pulses need less water and the life cycle is short,” said IMD chief LS Rathore.
 
 The government has a programme in place to achieve more than 19 million tonnes of pulse production.

Precious metals shine as EMs lose lustre,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/precious-metals-shine-as-ems-lose-lustre/articleshow/30758200.cms,m.economictimes.com,Precious metals shine as EMs lose lustre,"With the US Federal indicating in its January meeting that there’s a clear presumption in favour of trimming bond purchases by $10 billion at each meeting, there has been another round of slide in emerging market currencies, but this has brought the shine back in metals, especially gold and silver. 

 Both metals had, in fact, outperformed the MSCI World and the MSCI Emerging Index by a huge margin on a yearto-date basis. Gold has returned 9% in 2014 so far, which is one of highest returns on a YTD basis since 1983, while silver gained 11%. 

 The equity index has largely been flat, or 3-4% negative on a YTD basis. The crucial factor that bought the sheen back to metals is the re-emergence of ‘risk on’ trade and investors moving out of equity instruments. In the age of flight to safety, money pulled out of emerging markets on ‘increased country risk’ is being invested back in gold/silver. 
  
 The trades, based on the notion of ‘sell emerging markets and buy metals’ which led to the spread between MSCI Emerging Markets and gold spot, reversed on heightened risk perception from January 23, this year.

  In a chat with ET Now, Devang Visaria, Chief Strategist, devangvisaria.com, shares his views on the outlook of Pipavav Shipyard.
  
  
  What should one do with Pipavav Shipyard? If you had bought the stock at the Rs 80 levels, would you advise booking out or if you have not got into the stock, would you initiate a long at these levels?
   
  The first part is pretty easy because if you had got in at Rs 80, then you could possibly take some profits off the table but on a two or three week of basis, the stock looks likely to have more upsides from these levels also. Possibly Rs 105-110 are good targets with two or three week kind of horizon for Pipavav Shipyard. You could look to add to quantities if you do not have it. At these levels, you could buy with a stop loss below Rs 85. You could just accumulate this stock at these levels again at Rs 88-90 range. Rs 105-110 is a good target for Pipavav on the upside.

Now with the news out that Ranbaxy will sell the generic drug rights to Torrent Pharma and the drug sale will meet the fair trade norm for the Sun Pharma merger I believe that decks are being cleared for that. What would your view be on Sun Pharma essentially because Ranbaxy is just a derivative of that now? 

 
Hemindra Hazari: By and large, I have been quite positive on the pharma space, especially those which are exporting to the United States of America because along with IT, these two sectors should do much better other than the domestics in this FY15 and FY16 as well. So for me these will be more positive sectors where the visibility is more assured than what we are seeing because on the domestic side, you are seeing more and more uncertainty. There is more and more risk building up. So for me, I would definitely go for the pharma sector and Sun Pharma would be one of those companies.

But since then it has really been quite strong and even now to bottoming out in February after a bit of a correction it has had a slightly sharp correction in April, it has to be said but it is coming back to the levels it has reached this year. 
  
  The highs it has reached about Rs. 390 and it does look like a long term uptrend in the stock. So I think fairly good for investors. Just a downside can be a little sharp in this occasionally.

  The Pune-based software product development services company Persistent Systems benefits from its presence in niche areas of emerging technologies. Also, with its newly-adopted strategy to partner with large firms such as IBM and CISCO, etc., to offer services to bigger clients is likely to benefit the company.
  
  Persistent offers solutions in telecom, infrastructure and systems and life sciences space. Since September 2010, the company has forayed into cloud computing, analytics, enterprise mobility and enterprise collaboration.
  
  Over the past few quarters, the company posted single digit sequential growth in its topline. However, on the back of higher operating costs, operating profit margin dropped to 17-19%, from over 20% level. The company’s management has expressed caution over the global demand scenario.
  
  With lower number of working days, the December quarter is expected to be a weak contributor to annual revenue. The company has revised the revenue guidance for the fiscal downwards to $205-210 million against $220 million earlier. Net profit is expected to be in the range of Rs 125-135 crore. At the higher end, this is 10% lower than the profit recorded last year.
  
  The sharp depreciation in the rupee against the dollar would also have an adverse impact since the company has covered $103.5 million of its future revenue at a rate lower than the current prevailing dollar exchange rate of over Rs 52.6.
  
  The company’s new three-way strategy, which includes expansion of the existing client base, building services on technology platforms and enhancing high-margin intellectual property (IP) business, is likely to improve its profitability. IP and emerging technology are expected to be the future growth drivers. The company’s stock has dropped by over 30% in the past year. At the current market price of Rs 299, the stock is trading at 5.5 times its earnings for the trailing twelve months, cheaper than similar-size industry rivals, which are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 6-8 currently.

ONGC: Subsidy burden takes a toll; stock up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ongc-subsidy-burden-takes-a-toll-stock-up/articleshow/8659527.cms,m.economictimes.com,ONGC: Subsidy burden takes a toll; stock up,"
  Government-owned ONGC reported more than 60% sequential decline in net profit in January-March as it gave away about two-third of its oil revenues to subsidise losses of retailers amid soaring crude prices, reviving memories of fiscal 2008-09 when global crude peaked pushing up subsidies on fuel. 
  
  At 10:53 am, shares of ONGC were trading 0.77 per cent up at Rs 280.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The huge sequential fall in earnings stands in sharp contrast to private sector explorers such as Cairn India, which reported 22% growth in net profit helped by higher prices even though production fell. 
  
  ONGC's share in subsidy at Rs 12,135 crore in the fourth quarter was almost equal to the total of past three quarters. This took the total subsidy toll to Rs 24,892 crore for fiscal 2010-11, more than double than previous year. 
  
  In January-March, although ONGC earned an average oil price of $108.90 per barrel, it ended up with just $38.75 in hand as the government took away the rest. What remained was nearly 25% below the year-ago period causing a 26% fall in net profit. 
  
  State-run fuel retailers sell products such as diesel and cooking gas to end-customers at subsidised rates. The subsidy burden arising from selling the products below market price is shared between retailers, upstream companies, and the government. 
  
  The company reported net profit of Rs 2,791 crore in the last quarter driven by higher profits on natural gas, whose prices were revised in fiscal 2010-11, and increasing share of production from joint ventures. As there is no subsidy burden on production from joint ventures, the 60% incremental volumes helped. 
  
  Although oil prices have jumped more than five times since 2004-05, ONGC's average profit growth has been a mere 6.5% per annum. The average annual growth in its market capitalisation was just about 4.5%. Every year, the government has taken away a chunk of its profits to pay for losses made by oil marketing companies. 
  
  The subsidy sharing mechanism and its value-destructing impact will keep weighing on investor sentiment. The government is expected to divest its stake further in the company in early July. 
  
  This could induce the government to introduce some reforms for a better price. Investors, who are otherwise living off the annual dividend payouts, may look forward to a run-up in prices if the follow-on offer materialises.

 Exports of rapeseed meal during April-July showed a quantum jump of 77 per cent at 8,51,212 tonnes compared to 4,79,572 tonnes following a record crop and crushing which led to high processing, availability and exports, SEA said. 

 Currently, India ships rapeseed meal to South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and other Far East Countries at USD 295 FOB (Freight On Board) India, while rapeseed Hamburg ex-mill is at USD 376. 

 FOB is used when liability and ownership of goods is transferred from a seller to a buyer. 

 SEA further stated that soybean meal export is at the lowest level as Indian shipment is still outpriced in the international market. 

 Current price of soybean meal FOB Kandla (Gujarat) is quoted at USD 675 per tonne, while soybean meal Argentina CIF Rotterdam is quoted at USD 548 per tonne and Brazil at USD 534 per tonne.

This was largely aided by a significant drop in raw material prices due to a relative softening in prices of petrochemical intermediaries, including polyethylene and polypropylene. As a result, input costs as a percentage of sales fell sharply from 71% a year ago to 59% in the September.Lower costs have resulted in improved profitability. From the lows of 7% in the March 2009 quarter, operating margin expanded to 13% in the September 2009 quarter. At the current price, the scrip commands a P/E multiple of 15 on a trailing 12-month basis. Other injection moulding makers, including Supreme Industries and Wim Plast, are trading at a P/E of nine and seven, respectively. Nilkamal’s higher valuations partly reflect its financial recovery and its expansion plans for plastics retail. The company is investing in its own retail chain under the name @Home across the country. In the September 2009 quarter, it opened two new stores under this brand. At the current level, the stock seems to fully reflect its future potential to expand."

 Besides, a firming trend in metal at the London Metal Exchange (LME) supported the upside.

 The metal for delivery in July traded higher by Rs 3.30, or 0.40 per cent, to Rs 820.40 per kg in 35 lots.

  BHUBANESWAR: In a move to give a push to market capitalization and enhance value to the shareholders, the National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO) - the Navratna PSU, for the first time has opted for capital restructuring by splitting a share of Rs 10 into two shares of Rs five each.
  
  The aluminium major has approved 1:1 bonus, that is one bonus share for each share held, while taking into account the Q3 results in its Board Meeting held on January 31.
  
  “There has been consistent demand by shareholders to give bonus keeping the profit and heavy reserves in mind. By enhancing the number of shares and reducing the price for each share, the float and liquidity of the share shall be enhanced in stock exchange,” Nalco director, finance B.L. Bagra on Wednesday told “The ET”.
  
  “This is also expected to increase the market capitalization and enhance value to the shareholders,” Mr Bagra added.
  
  Nalco’s paid-up capital of Rs.644.31 crore would stand enhanced to Rs.1288.62 crore, without any cash consideration, once the Board’s resolution is endorsed by the shareholders in a meeting likely to be convened in March 2011.
  
  By amending the Article of Association, Nalco also has created a provision for issue of ESOP that is shares to its employees. The ESOP is planned to be issued to the executives of the company as part payment of dues to them under performance related payment (PRP), a component of revised pay package. The detailed scheme of ESOP, including price, is yet to be finalized, Mr Bagra clarified.

  BHUBANESWAR: Navratna public sector National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO) has posted net profit of Rs 1069.30 crore in 2010-11, up by 31 per cent over previous year's figure of Rs 814.22 crore.
  
  The company registered impressive results both in sales and profit for 2010-11, a company statement said here.
  
  According to the audited financial results for the year 2010-11, taken on record by the Board of Directors in a meeting held in New Delhi today, NALCO has posted net profit of Rs 1069.30 crore, registering an increase of 31 per cent over previous year's figure of Rs 814.22 crore.
  
  Similarly, the sales turnover of Rs 5958.98 crore, also showed a rise of 18 per cent, from Rs 5054.73 crore achieved in the previous fiscal.
  
  ""The results would have been still better but for the adverse impact of exchange rate of rupee on sales, which made a dent of Rs 159 crore,"" a senior executive said.
  
  The rise in net profit and sales turnover is mostly attributed to better market realisations, in addition to some contributions by way of higher production and sale of metal.
  
  During the year, average sales realization per tonne of alumina has gone up to USD 350 from USD 264 in 2009-10. Similarly, average sales realization per tonne of aluminium metal jumped to USD 2335 from USD 1946 in the previous year.
  
  The company has reported improved performance in terms of production and sales for 2010-11. During the year, the company has achieved the highest-ever cast metal production of 443,597 tonnes, against the previous best of 431,488 tonnes achieved during the previous fiscal.
  
  Similarly, with the commissioning of 10th unit of captive power plant in middle of the year, NALCO registered an increase in net power generation to 6608 million units, up from 6293 million units last year.

  In a chat with ET Now, KR Choksey, Chairman, KR Choksey Securities, shares his views on various stocks. 
   
  
  Let’s start with your No. 1 stock idea for next 6 months for our viewers.
   
  My first recommendation is Munjal Auto. Munjal Auto is a Hero Group company which is managed by Sudhir Munjal. It is an automobile ancillary company catering mainly to the 2 wheeler industry. 
  
  This company’s main products are muffler, second is motorcycle rims and third one is scooter wheels. This company has 3 factories. One at Baroda, second at Haryana and third one is at Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Equity capital of this company is 10 crores. 
  
  In the year 2010-2011, this company made a turnover of Rs 521 crores and they made a gross profit of Rs 40 crores and net profit of Rs 25 crores. So on an equity capital of Rs 10 crores, the earning per share was Rs 25. 
  
  The company's management believes in rewarding the investors and hence they have declared Rs 7.5 as dividend. In the current year, in the first 9 months, the company has achieved a turnover of Rs 500 crores and gross of Rs 41 crores and net profit of Rs 30 crores. So one can see that the company has achieved more profit than what is achieved in the last full year.

  In a chat with ET Now, Deepak Mohoni, Director, trendwatchindia.com, shares his stock ideas.
  
  
  How does Mundra Port look on the charts?
   
  Mundra Port corrected quite a bit in the last one month. It has come down about 10-11%, which is much heavier than the index. But today's move looks quite interesting. It is straight off to about a week's high and if this sustains, then that could be pretty much the end of the correction. Otherwise the long-term chart of this stock looks pretty decent. It bottomed out in February. It did not have much of a bear market. So, there seems to be an excellent amount for the stock certainly at around Rs 130, that's held out very nicely for quite a while now and we are not too far above that level. So, if somebody likes the stock, this is not too bad an opportunity to get in, as I said the medium-term correction maybe just about coming to an end now.

MRPL surges on Colombian crude buy plan,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/mangalore-refineries-and-petrochemicals-ltd/5,economictimes.indiatimes.com,HOLAXD,HOLAXD

  MUMBAI: The 21% net profit growth that Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) posted for the December 2010 quarter could have been better if the heavy forex gains of last year were not taken into account. Hence, the company’s performance should not be judged from the reaction of stock market.
  
  The MRPL scrip got a severe beating on Wednesday as it fell more than 8% to its 52-week low in spite of a healthy December quarter show. 
  
  At the operational level, the company’s performance was much better, with gross refining margins at $6 per barrel and highest ever throughput of 3.49 million tonne. 
  
  The company’s operating profit grew 87% against the year-ago period. However, the Rs 153-crore foreign exchange gains it had booked last December meant that the growth in gross profit was just 14%. 
  
  Another factor that affected profit growth during the quarter was the provisions for pay revisions of non-managerial staff. The company wrote off Rs 56 crore during the quarter towards arrears of pay revisions with effect from April 2007.
  
  The company is working on a mega-investment programme, which will almost triple its gross block by end FY12. It is implementing a Rs 14,000-crore refinery expansion project to be completed by October. This will not only expand its refining capacity from 12 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes, but also improve its ability to process cheaper varieties of crude oil, which are heavier or with higher sulphur content. 
  
  Another major project will add 0.44 million tonnes of polypropylene capacity by April 2012 at a capital cost of Rs 1,800 crore.
  
  MRPL is also working with ONGC to set up an aromatics complex in a special economic zone near its refinery in Mangalore. The Rs 5,750-crore project is scheduled to be commissioned by end FY13. 
  
  Considering the recent fall in market value and gains in corporate earnings, the company’s valuations dipped to a price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 12.3. The global refining industry appears to have come out of the woods with gross refining margins, or the money a refiner makes on refining each barrel of crude oil, moving up in the December quarter. The first few weeks of the March 2011 quarter indicate that the strength continues, which can prove a key positive for the company going ahead.

  On the back of a strong recovery in the vehicle sector MRF stepped up net sales by 22.38% to Rs 1653.84 crore (Rs 1351.30 crore). Other operating income netted Rs 2.46 crore (Rs 67 lakhs).
  
  It reported a marginal six per cent rise in total expenditure at Rs 1471.18 crore (Rs 1388.57 crore). Company sources rubber prices had remained same as in the previous two quarters. But, in Q1, cost of petroleum derivatives had come down. The company incurred higher cost on employees and depreciation charges due to the capex.
  
  Interest charges halved to Rs 11.72 crore ( Rs 22.78 crore). Export earnings remained almost same at Rs 150 crore. In the first quarter itself, MRF has reported half of the Rs 253.03 crore net profit made in the accounting year ending September 30, 2009 when it reported net sales of Rs 5663.8 crore.

ET Now: MRF numbers bring me to that tyre space because funds are actively buying into the tyre companies. We saw evidence of that yesterday with JK Tyre. The stocks are trading at fresh 52-week highs and they are continuing unabated. The Ceat QIP II on right now. what do you make of this space and particularly MRF as well with another quarter of very robust numbers? 
 
 
Dipan Mehta: In the last two-three years, the tyre companies have done exceedingly well. Certain amount of pricing discipline has come through and capacities have not come in place. At the same time, demand has increased pretty well and some of the export markets also have opened up for lot of these tyre companies and, of course, the final benefit was account of lower raw material cost especially rubber and all those benefits are flowing to the top line and the bottom line for most tyre companies. If you see in terms of performance, MRF had a bit of a laggard but after this result, one could clearly conclude that definitely the company has caught up with his peer group and maybe from this point on, it may even do better than its peer group considering its dominant position within the industry.
 
 
ET Now: Right but which is your top bet when it comes to the tyre space. MRF is an expensive stock but nevertheless it has had a strong run?
 
 
Dipan Mehta: Well some of the smaller tyre companies like TVS Srichakra and to an extent even Balkrishna Industries look quite interesting but Balkrishna came out with disappointing set of numbers. So we just like to hold our recommendation over there but TVS Srichakra continues to do exceedingly well and it is kind of a niche player. So that would be the preference but after these numbers of MRF, one would need to look at MRF more closely and understand exactly what went right for the company and that could also turn out to be a good investment opportunity.

 Rajen Shah: I continue to be extremely bullish on the MNC pharma space. All pharma companies have moved up. Lupin, Wockhardt and a number of other midcap companies have also done very well. But I am a big fan of MNC pharma companies, so I believe that companies like Merck, Wyeth, Novartis, Pfizer are quoting at one-fifth or may be one-tenth of the market cap, what they are quoting in US, not even one-tenth, in fact, much lesser than what they quoting in US. 

 With India probably opening up more and more in future this all MNC companies will certainly try to expand their presence in India because so far they have been neglecting their subsidiaries. You see the market cap of Merck, Wyeth, Novartis and Pfizer, this is peanuts actually. Probably we could also see some delisting thing happening in case of MNC pharma companies. 

 So I feel that the opportunity in the pharma industry is huge so probably these parent companies may get more serious because they have been so far not taking that keen interest in their subsidiaries, so I am a big fan of MNC pharma at these levels.

 The state-run company has been looking for investors to offload its 26 per cent stake in the commodity bourse, Indian Commodity Exchange (ICEX), which wound up its operations towards the end of 2013. Currently, MMTC holds 5.20 crore equity shares in ICEX at a face value of Rs 5 each.
 
 ""The board of directors has ""approved the proposal for sale of 10 per cent of ICEX equity i.e. 5 per cent each, to two bidders who participated in the global tender against the present holding of 26 per cent in ICEX by MMTC at Rs 10 per share subject to the approval by the government and the Forward Markets Commission,"" the company said in a filing to BSE.
 
 ICEX does not have sufficient net worth and requires infusion of funds from existing shareholders as well as investment from fresh shareholders. However, MMTC is is not interested in infusing more funds to increase the net worth of the exchange to meet the regulatory norms, a PTI report said.
 
 MMTC had invited bids for purchase of a minimum 20 lakh shares (equivalent to 1 per cent shareholding in the bourse) at a minimum reserve price of Rs 10 a piece.
 
 The stock has lost 96 per cent of its market capitalisation in the past five years. The offer for sale (OFS) for 10 per cent of its stake in June 2013 was priced at a 72 per cent discount to the then prevailing stock price. Later in the year, FMC had issued a show-cause notice to ICEX, scrapping its registration because no business has been generated on the exchange since December 2013.
 
 During the end of 2013, the ICEX had decided to wind up operations and trading was accordingly suspended on December 24, 2013 after the business volumes got affected due to several factors including imposition of commodity transaction tax and the Rs 5,500 crore payment scam at NSEL.
 
 Other stakeholders in ICEX include Reliance Exchange Next with 26 per cent, IBFSL and Abhinay Trading Corporation's 14 per cent each, Indian Potash Ltd with 10 per cent, while KRIBHCO and IDFC hold five per cent each in the exchange.

Also in conversation is Varun Daga, Co-founder & Fund Manager, Girik Capital. Edited excerpts:

How you are looking at the overall set up for the equity markets? The on-ground situation is adverse because of Covid and the FIIs are also continuously pulling out money.
Varun Daga: The market, as we always say, has a mind of its own and is now probably looking into the future. From the earnings side, we have had some good news as many sectors did well. So on the market front, things are looking alright. Markets are not willing to sell off that easily. The bull market looks robust. We have seen pockets of overvaluation at some places, but the overall market looks fine.

Before the second wave, we were doing so well across all sectors and this (Covid 2.0) was a setback. But hopefully, if things get back to normal on the economy side, the market is waiting for that issue to get sorted. Fundamentally, we do not see any big reason (for selloff). Domestic demand might get a little affected but there are a lot of opportunities on the exports side.


How will the inflation in raw material prices impact the FMCG sector, given its high valuation?

Charandeep Singh: There are headwinds in consumption-oriented sectors. There is no doubt that many of these companies are performers. But you have an earnings headwind over here because of commodity price inflation and the consumer slowdown in general. So it is possible that you may not get the desired outcome in terms of long-term IRR in this sector.


One often wonders as to how long is the metals rally going to last. Copper and other base metals are hitting fresh all-time highs. Do you feel that there is more upside left or would you say that the best is behind us?
Charandeep Singh: The last time you saw metals performing was in the rally from 2001 to 2008, and then a little bit at the beginning of this decade. It is very important for us to understand that the profit pools in a lot of these metal companies are cyclical. In the last decade, there were demand headwinds and many of these companies did not make good capital allocation decisions. The markets tend to react in an excessive manner, both pessimistically and optimistically, when it comes to cyclicals. 

But to paint all the companies in the sector with the same brush is not fair. This rally could also be because of restructuring in some of these metal companies in the last decade. They have cleaned up their balance sheets and divested non-core assets. This sector has got consolidated in a large way. In steel, for example, the top 4-5 steel producers in India produce bulk of the metal now. Through the NCLT procedure, a lot of valuable assets got gobbled up. 

The second thing you have is better asset allocation incrementally. Third thing, I would say, is that the best steel companies in India produce a decent return on capital and have a very secular demand scenario. So if you look at them over the last 25-30 years, they have done volume growth north of GDP and that is quite commendable. 

In the near-term, they are benefiting from a great pricing scenario globally. If you are selling 50% more metal, then you have a great chance of creating more operating leverage, especially if you are capital disciplined. 

Let us not assume this is a one-time thing or just a reset. It could be a compounding story as well. We should be open to that.


Is the rerating in speciality chemicals going to continue going forward? Are there opportunities or would you say that the best is in the price already?
Varun Daga: To a large extent, the multiple re-rating is probably done. But in terms of the opportunity size, it is huge. India is a hub for manufacturing and all these companies have become sizable ones now. They are generating enough capital on their own and do not really need to borrow money. So they can take up contracts from anywhere in the globe and produce at the cheapest cost. 

Having said that, they have run up a lot but all we have to focus is on growth and the size of opportunity. There are times when the market corrects and you get enough opportunities where some of these good businesses can be bought.


On pharma stocks
Varun Daga: I do not think the best is behind for pharma. It is a very typical sector because every company has its own fundamentals. There are different sectors within pharma - APIs, formulations, domestic and exports. You need to pick leaders in different areas. The story is still under play and they have better times ahead.

I know it is a truncated trading week but nevertheless it is a very big week for our markets. Are there more legs to this rally? Is the washout of a festive season and supply disruptions getting sorted out?If you see the market patterns, for almost six months now, there has been a very smart rotation at play wherein at different points of time, different sectors are performing. Some sectors are going through a bit of a lull and depending upon the triggers and the developments, certain other sectors are coming into limelight. 
 
Auto has been a performing sector for a while but in the two-wheeler space, the overall performance has not been that great because of the lack of demand. We are not seeing much of an excitement there but the Q2 numbers of most of the companies had indicated that the worst of the chip supply is behind them and gradually we will see the revival in terms of supply. Malaysian chipmakers starting to work at 100% capacity and smart chip issues receding came as a big positive surprise wherein there is a sense that growth will come back.
 
But one has to bear in mind is that the entire update on the improvement in chips is not going to benefit all the companies across. We feel that companies like Maruti and Motherson Sumi would be a bigger beneficiary of this development whereas the companies which are relying upon the European suppliers like JLR and some other global companies, may not benefit immediately. We like Maruti and Motherson Sumi as top picks both in the OEM and auto ancillary space. There is some more leg in terms of the upside for these two names.
 

Out of the three listed stocks and it will be four tomorrow, which is the one new tech stock you think should be part of everyone’s long-term portfolio where you may see a hit of 25% but it should be part of the core portfolio like a HDFC Bank in 2000 or Bajaj Finance in 2010?Even though IPO valuations have been on the higher side, we are seeing that post listing, the overall momentum and the activity around the IPOs have been exceptionally good. We are bringing in a lot of optimism in terms of what sort of growth these companies can throw up over the next three, five, seven years. 
 
Given the sort of dynamics that we are working with, we would really want to focus upon names where at least the basic product or the platform is showing a lot of promise in terms of traction and the management pedigree or the guys who are backing these companies are good. From that perspective, both Zomato and Nykaa are looking pretty promising in terms of what they have built so far. There is no point talking about valuations. It is all about what sort of growth in terms of top line or certain parameters that the market is looking at. We have to have a smaller allocation to these companies if we have to make them part of the portfolio. We have to see how over a period of time, they perform but these two names definitely are looking quite promising in terms of what they have built so far.
 

Which is your favourite unlock trade? Hotel, hospitality, travel, fashion?Retail like Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent are the names where we have seen very remarkable growth come back into the system. The sense we are getting is that the growth from here on is going to be much better. So definitely in terms of open up themes, we like these two names.
 
Apart from that, of course, Indian Hotels has been something that we have been liking a lot and given the fact that in the second half, the general occupancy levels are much better and this time around both in terms of business travel as well as the leisure travel we have seen a good traction. Travel is going to catch up big time over the next two quarters. 
 

In the pre Covid era, hotel stocks were not great wealth creators. Just because Covid has happened and they are making a comeback, some of those stocks are at a new high. Why should we go and buy hotel stocks because they still need capital and the return ratios are cyclical?A good insight. Our take is that you will see some sort of a consolidation play out in the last 12-15 months of this pandemic wherein smaller hotel units have shut down and the bigger guys have consolidated and a lot of cost controls have happened because of the way things have been for the hospitality sector. There are advantages of a much better positioning in the hospitality space, cost controls and the fact that the way things are going to shape up, the pricing environment and the occupancy levels are going to be much better.
 
The entire operating leverage could play out over the next 12-18 months and that would lead to some sort of a rerating of the larger players. I agree that it has not been one of the best performing sectors in terms of wealth creation, but from a technical positioning, given the way things have been, we think there is going to be a lot of excitement around the numbers that these companies are going to throw up and that could lead to some sort of a rerating.
 

We have also started seeing the API focus pharmaceutical stocks make a comeback. How are you approaching this entire sector now that the base effect of Covid will also no longer be at play?One thing which Covid and the entire sequence of events which happened in the last 12-15 months has taught us is that healthcare and diagnostics are going to be extremely critical from an overall lifestyle perspective. We all may get a little more cautious in terms of how to approach the healthcare and the kind of precautions that we need to take to see that we are a little better prepared to deal with any eventuality that would lead to much higher revenue for both healthcare companies as well as diagnostic companies.
 
We will see a big traction there. In terms of allocation, we think names like Apollo are going to be important because this is one stock which has done very well even with Covid and without Covid. The way they have expanded I think it is going to be a big beneficiary. Diagnostic is an area where one could see a lot of allocation because of the way things are. One should have a decent amount of allocation for these two sectors in the portfolio.
 

Why did you tweet about Ipca Labs today morning?Ipca numbers were not great and the stock has been a laggard for about two quarters. In healthcare and some of these companies where the overall growth is going to be slightly muted, the performance may not be that great. It is a good stock for somebody who wants to play the export and the API part but the overall growth triggers or the excitement factor would be missing in the near term.
 
 One should focus on Sun Pharma or Divi’s where the overall growth visibility is much better or even Gland Pharma where the stock has corrected from Rs 4,000 to Rs 3,500, but the growth visibility and the triggers are much better.

  By Gaurav Mehta
  
  The uncertainty around UP and other state elections has dominated investor attention of late -- so with the event outcome now imminent on this very day, the markets can be expected to be volatile, in the least. 
  
  However, from an overall trend perspective, both Nifty and Bank Nifty indices remain in an upward trend. Barring any exceptionally adverse outcome, we think that downsides, if any, should be limited and be used as buying opportunities. 
  
  The recent surge in Nifty implied volatility along with a significant addition in put positions clearly suggests that market participants have already taken ample protective measures. 
  
  It further indicates that there is low probability of sharp downside reactions. 
  
  We, thus, remain positive on Nifty, Bank Nifty in the medium term. From a stock-specific perspective we like Tata Motors and Voltas on the long side. 
  
  However, on the flip side we think FMCG stocks, especially Hindustan Unilever, look vulnerable to downside move. A break below 378 in the stock has the potential to shave off another 10% and, hence, should be used to create short positions.

  Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, in an interview with ET Now talks about the upcoming market trend.
  
  
  Stepping into the week because now we are going talk about earnings, what is it that you will be focussing on? 
  
  In general what we are going to see is growth coming in from most of the spaces, particularly you are going to see some of the heavyweights coming out with better numbers. We are going to see numbers coming good from Reliance side. 
  
  Also some of the banking stocks, private sector banks particularly where they did not have to do some provisioning kind of thing in the balance sheets. So they should be coming out with better numbers. IT companies we are expecting in general about between 15% and 20% growth reported in the bottom line. So auto companies for sure would definitely demand good amount of attention. 
  
  For a rally that they have seen in the volume, they should get reflected into the bottom line performance of this company. So overall, one can easily expect that the first quarter earning estimates would probably lead to somewhere around 25% growth in the financial year 2010-2011 and that should provide a much larger comfort to the investors to look at the Indian market. 
  
  Because if that being the situation and we are trading at around 16.5 times on a forward 9-month earning estimate basis for this financial year which would be sufficient enough for somebody to look at this market very positively. So I am reasonably confident that yes, overall, the macro aspects if they are coming under control in particular European economy related, my reading says that emerging markets like India would definitely demand better attention and we should be seeing further upside continuing in our market. 
  
  Though it would be very stock specific direction but it will be certainly there in our markets. So reasonably, we are remaining confident in that aspect.

Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/macros-suddenly-turning-supportive-for-markets-ajay-bodke/articleshow/38466461.cms,m.economictimes.com,Macros suddenly turning supportive for markets: Ajay Bodke,"In a chat with ET Now, Ajay Bodke, Head-Investment Strategist & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher, shares his views on the markets.
 
 
ET Now: Just when it appeared that Indian markets were looking slightly rusty, last 60 minutes yesterday made all the difference. What did the trick for us?
 
 
Ajay Bodke: What clearly is evident is that the macro variables are suddenly turning supportive for India. We saw some of the key data variables coming over the last few weeks. Be it the IIP number for May at 4.7 per cent where after nearly 15 quarters, the consumer durable numbers have done positive at 3.2 per cent. Followed by a four-month low WPI number that came in last week and a CPI number which presently surprised the market at 7.3 per cent which is the lowest since the new series has been started being computed from January 2012. So these are the issues that have been taken positively by the market.
 
 Also globally the crude prices, coal prices, iron and steel prices are clearly showing to be under control. Let us not forget that 75 per cent of India’s trade deficit is the oil and 12 per cent of India’s trade deficit is coal. So you are essentially looking at a substantial chunk of a trade deficit and the commodities contributing them on a downward trend. That is bringing cheer back to the market in addition to the budget which in view of the very tight fiscal space available to the Finance Minister has presented an admirable budget.
 
 Especially with drought looming in the wheat bowl as well as central parts of India as well as only 7 regions out of 36 sub-metro divisions getting excess rainfall and the rest of either having scanty or deficit rainfall. So we have to keep a very close watch on a weekly basis about the sowing data and on the progress of the monsoons. But overall, we are in my opinion over the hump and the market should consolidate at the current level.

ET Now: What are your closing comments? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: For me, this is a market which remains in an uptrend but now very close to important supply points. Typically, a good way to trade this kind of situation would be to tighten your stop losses. In case, the market fails to give a breakout, we might see it get back into this broad 180-200 point range with the 6180-6160 as support and 6320-6350 as the upper end of the range.
 
 In case there is a good breakout happening, then we might want to look at higher levels and if the Nifty manages to get pass 6350-6360 on a closing basis, good chance that we will head towards 6480-6500 sometime during the March expiry. So the bias is positive but given the fact that we are very close to historical levels, tactically we are trading with shorter stop losses. Individual stock I am still positive, the Nifty midcap index has given a strong buy signal and maybe the breadth might do better than the broader index.

Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/long-term-bonds-appear-to-be-the-magic-wand/articleshow/38833689.cms,m.economictimes.com,Long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan last week performed a sex reassignment surgery on the Indian banking sector. He permitted banks to raise funds selling long-term bonds to build infrastructure. The logic was that building infrastructure is time-consuming, so it needed to be funded by long-term funds instead of short-term deposits, the mainstay of banks.


	Just a few months ago, RBI bought the argument of IDFC, an institution created exclusively to fund infrastructure projects, that its survival will be under threat if it keeps borrowing long-term through bonds. It granted a licence to IDFC to turn itself into a bank so that it can take deposits. The logic was it makes eminent sense to take deposits and lend rather than through bonds for 10 years. That could be done only if IDFC changes its gender, the wish that Rajan granted.


	How is it that in a matter of few months the regulator buys two different arguments, and grants opposite wishes? Is the regulator framing policies for industry, or individual cases determine what the policy is?


	The irony is that this is not the first time that the Indian financial sector is undergoing gender reassignment, but the second time in less than two decades. In the 1990s, development financial institutions led by ICICI converted into banks with a ‘convert or perish’ campaign espoused by its then chief K V Kamath. ICICI Bank succeeded, IDBI Bank managed to remain afloat following it. But the one that chose to retain the financial institution character, IFCI, is nearly irrelevant.


	If borrowing long term and lending was a wrong business model then for ICICI and now for IDFC, how is it that it’s good for banks? Are we making the entire banking system into development financial institutions?


	It was not the dearth of funds, but the composition of funding and lending that landed the Indian banking industry in a soup. Years of lending short-term bank funds to long-term projects, throwing the basics of asset-liability management to the winds, made banks shaky. When the interest rate cycle turned higher and the economy slowed, all the sins of the bull market came back to haunt. There is nothing to show that it will be different in the next cycle.


	Keeping in mind the ICICI and IDFC experience, it would have been wiser to ask: why did banks lend long-term instead of permitting them to sell long-term bonds? It also doesn't help in the efficient development of bond markets. Why should banks compete with its own customers in the same market for funds?


	 

	If banks are smart, they should not sell bonds, or stop just with token bond issues. If they go all out as if there is no tomorrow, they may well be sowing the seeds of the next banking crisis. The current one is because their funds are short term and lending is long term. The next one will be the flip side of it – longer term funds and short-term assets.


	There is near-unanimity that Indian interest rate cycle is at its peak now, and the only direction for rates is to head south. It is the outcome for which Rajan is working so hard. So, goading banks to borrow long term at current interest rates is something similar to what US Federal Reserve former chairman Alan Greenspan did to mortgage borrowers. Greenspan advised individual borrowers to shift to floating rates. That turned out to be the worst financial advice that anyone could give. It left millions homeless.


	Given the Indian financial tradition and the smartness of borrowers, the dice will be loaded against banks in the case of long-term bonds.


	At current interest rates, banks may be borrowing at near 10% without a call or put option. But they may be lending to someone who may have the choice of refinancing the loan at a lower rate when interest rates ease. Not many borrowers will accept covenants that prevent such a switch. So, the liability of banks will be for longer term, and assets could be of a shorter duration.


	Apart from Indian banking coming a full circle, it also raises the question of which is the right model. The truth is there is no formula for good profits all the time. It’s the quest for profitability that drives managements to compromise on prudence and overdo anything that delivers profits.


	This is the beginning of the next boom for the Indian economy. For the banking industry, long-term bonds appear to be the magic wand that will bring them out of the current mess and set them on the path to eternal profitability.


	What may begin as a trickle may quickly gather pace. The test will be how many guard against getting carried away. If there are excesses, then the system may end up being a eunuch once again looking for a gender change.

The stock has gained 9% in the past one month against a flat Sensex. The stock made its 52-week high of Rs 275 on January 4. KKCL’s performance on bourses has been outstanding. For instance, in the past three months, the stock has gained 37%, and it has doubled in six months. The stock gave an annual return of 113% beating the Sensex as well the ET Retail Index that rose 86% and 80% during the period, respectively. KKCL, which clocked revenues of Rs 159.4 crore in the past four quarters, manufactures jeans, semi-formals and casual wear under the brands Killer, Integriti, Lawman and Easies. Killer is the flagship brand that commands the highest margin for KKCL. Around 3-4% of KKCL’s sales are from exports to Asia, Middle East and the US. The company has doubled its net profit in the first half of FY10 against that reported in the same period a year ago. It has reported an impressive operating performance in the past two quarters and will continue to do so in the future due to economies of scale on account of increased production capacity. Besides volume, average realisation has also gone up. The company sells products on a consignment basis, thus transferring the risk to its franchisee. \This asset-light strategy, coupled with integration and low-working capital requirements enables the company to enjoy higher returns on equity and on capital employed. In FY09, the company cleared a lot of its pending stock and has maintained low inventory levels since then, which will help in maintaining margins. The company reported net sales of Rs 57 crore in the September 2009 quarter, up 19% from the corresponding period a year ago. Operating profit at Rs 16.3 crore and a net profit at 11.5 crore were the highest since the time the company got listed in 2006. It has improved its debt to equity ratio from 0.17x on March 2009 to 0.10x as on September 2009. It also has surplus cash of Rs 105 crore, which leaves enough scope for further expansion. At Rs 267 and an annualised EPS of Rs 28.8 for FY10, the stock is valued at 9.3x its earnings, which makes it a good buy at this point of time. Going ahead, it could be a good turnaround stock for one’s portfolio. "

ET Now: Do you think the rupee adjustment in large cap IT stocks is not fully captured or could IT stocks see some more downside given the way how the rupee has appreciated? 

 
Gautam Chhaochharia: We still maintain our overweight stance on IT services sectors. What we have seen till now is more of a sector rotation rather than reflecting the rupee appreciation and on the other hand we would also like to point out or argue that the levels of rupee at 62-63 was not really factored into most of the street earnings estimates because it was just for a short period of time. 

 So in that context, I do not think the rupee will move either from Rs 60 to Rs 63 levels or the move back has played a big role. It has been more a sector rotation trade which has happened specifically given EM flows globally. So investors have been forced to do more sector rotation rather than add significant positions on India. 

 The second point to highlight from our perspective, where we still maintain our overweight position on IT, is that for us IT is not just about a currency play. So that is one small short-term tactical issue, but the two bigger drivers for was, one, this recovery being seen in the US and Europe, which continues. 

 Secondly, the building blocks for more medium-term growth visibility for this sector is now emerging in the form of infrastructure and BPO sectors which have achieved scale and which can provide growth visibility not just for next one-two years, but for the longer term which is critical for valuations to sustain or even rerate from the current levels.

 Operating margin will be under pressure due to onsite wage hikes and a limited support from the currency movements. In addition, the revenue guidance for FY14 will likely be far more optimistic than the prior year considering the momentum in winning new accounts, believe analysts.
 
 Infosys, the second largest IT exporter among those listed on Indian bourses will declare its quarterly and annual financial performance on Friday, April 12, 2013.
 
 According to the average estimates of the forecasts by eight brokerages and estimates of ET Intelligence Group, Infosys is expected to report 3% increase in revenue in the March 2013 quarter from the previous quarter. Net profit, however, will fall by 3% sequentially reflecting analysts’ expectation of pressure on profitability.
 
 The consolidation of Lodestone’s business is likely to add 1-2% in the dollar terms to Infosys’s topline for the quarter, which means the core business growth will likely be muted at around 2% compared with the previous quarter’s 6% sequential jump. Volume growth is expected to be over 1.5%, lower than 2% in the previous quarter.
 
 The company increased onsite salaries by 2-3%, which will impact the operating profitability marginally for the March quarter.
 
 Investors will await to see whether the company continues to provide annual performance guidance given rising uncertainty in the global demand scenario. Analysts expect 9-12% revenue growth guidance from Infosys for FY14. This is higher than the anticipated 6% increase in the FY13 revenue.

 Other companies from the IT sector are also expected to extend the growth momentum seen in the first quarter of the current financial year on the back of improving visibility in the US markets and higher off-shoring from Europe.

 The bank said net profit rose to Rs 421.06 crore from Rs 334.84 crore in the year-ago quarter. Core fee income rose 38% to Rs 487 crore. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and paid out, rose 18% to Rs 801 crore.
 
 Shares of IndusInd Bank fell after the results were announced. The stock lost 1.65% to close at Rs 543.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on a day when the exchange’s benchmark index, the Sensex, slipped 0.54%.
 
 “We have grown our net profit powered by core fee income, which was also up 10% quarter-on-quarter,” said Romesh Sobti, MD and CEO at IndusInd Bank. “There has been rock-stable quality of our loan book.”
 
 The bank expanded its loans by 24% y-o-y to Rs 58,664 crore. Corporate loans rose 38% to Rs 33,300 crore, while retail or consumer finance loans were up just 9% at 25,364 crore.
 
 The ratio of corporate to retail loans stood at 57:43 compared with 51:49 a year ago. The bank said it plans to expand retail lending in the current fiscal as it sees good demand for vehicle financing in the coming quarters on the back of economic optimism.
 
 “In commercial vehicle segment, there is definitely demand picking up. Mining bans are being lifted in some states,” Sobti said, adding that all vehicle loans will have good demand. Demand for two-wheeler loans was significantly higher in the vehicle loans segment.
 
 The lender’s net bad loans or non-performing asset ratio stood at 0.33% versus 0.21% in the year-ago quarter.
 
 The bank has provided Rs 20 crore for corporate clients having un-hedged exposures as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India a few months ago. However, the bank has provided double the amount it actually required.
 
 According to Sobti, the profit level would have been higher without this provision. There could be a possibility of write-back of this provision if all banks decide to pass on the cost to their borrowing companies.
 
 “I certainly feel, achhe din aane wale hein (good days are set to come). A lot of political capital has been created due to the mandate (given to the new government). Markets are up. It means some stressed companies can access market for raising capital,” he said.

 IGL was fighting a case against PNGRB for past three years after the latter directed it to cut network tariff by 63 per cent in 2012 and refund the difference to customers retrospectively from April 1, 2008 till the date of the order.
 
 The Apex Court in its ruling upheld Delhi High Court verdict and said the regulator has no power to ser retail gas rates.
 
 IGL, which traded at an average P/E multiple of 20 times, touched a multiple of 9.74 after the order. It's currently trading at 12.65 times as against the average of 14.26 of past eight years.
 
 The verdict removes uncertainties in the mind of investors, said Rajesh Vedvyas, Former MD of IGL. Gas distribution pricing should take place by competition not by regulators: SC Tripathi, Former Oil Secretary said. 

 According to analysts, it’s a shot in the arm for IGL. People were waiting for the stock to get its due. 

 “The stock was subdued after it got entangled in the case. It is likely to move higher and touch Rs 540-550 zone in next few quarters,” said Prakash Diwan, Director - Altamount Capital Management.

Indian companies’ return on equity (RoE) — a measure of a firm’s efficiency at maximising profits for shareholders — which in 2013-14 hit the lowest level in a decade, is expected to pick up in the current financial year driven by possible decline in interest rates, margin recovery and improved asset turnover ratio, said HSBC.  	RoE is expected to increase from 15% in 2013-14 to 16.5% by 2015-16. Indian companies’ RoE hit a peak of 22% in 2005. Although RoE has fallen in all major markets over the past few years on weaker global growth, RoE contraction in India has been among the most severe.  	“Although we do not expect RoE to return to the highs of 2005-08 anytime soon, we believe it has bottomed and expect profitability to improve,” said Jitendra Sriram, equity strategist and head of research, HSBC in a note. “We forecast RoE to rise 150 bps by FY16 and 200 bps by FY17 from the current level of 15%,” he said.  	HSBC expects materials and industrials to contribute significantly to the expected increase in India’s overall RoE  	HSBC said companies’ ROE compression was triggered by factors such as the decline in corporate profitability, increases in interest rates and a rising component of overseas revenues. The cost of doing business in India has gone up sharply due to factors such as an increase in the cost of inputs, difficulty in acquiring land and tougher environmental regulation, said the note.  	RBI hiked rates 13 times between March 2010 and October 2011 as it attempted to curb inflationary pressures. HSBC research shows the main drag on India’s overall RoE has clearly come from domestic cyclical sectors. The industrial sector’s RoE plunged from 34% in March 2005 to an all-time low of 11% in the last fiscal year ending March 2014. "

 Its glass-packaging business is also set for a turnaround, which would lead to non-linear earnings growth in the next two years. “We will grow at least 20% for the next two years in the bathroom products business. We are the price setters and we have been consistently outpacing the industry,” Sandip Somany, managing director of HSIL, told ET. “In our glass business, the losses are declining and we expect the business to become profitable at operating levels in the first half of 2014-15.”
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Though HSIL’s stock has gained 30% in the past month, it still continues to be under-valued if the two businesses — sanitary ware and glass — are to be valued independently. In the first nine months of the current fiscal, the operating profit (EBIT) of HSIL’s bathroom products grew 24%. Its profit after tax for the trailing 12 months is around Rs110 crore.
 
 Its peers — Cera and Kajaria — are trading at earnings multiples of 24 and 22, respectively. Giving HSIL a conservative multiple of 20, its building product business should be valued at Rs2,000 crore. But the company’s market capitalisation is only Rs830 crore. This is despite the company’s strong growth and margins compared with its peers. (see table) The reason for this is the glasspackaging business, which after being a drag for the last two years, is now on the road to recovery. HSIL has increased prices of the glass container business after almost two years.
 
 After growing at 27% CAGR from FY08-FY12, HSIL’s glass business started slowing down due to over capacity in the industry and the overall slowdown, especially consumption of beverages, beer and liquor. But the consumption is likely to pick up. Liquor and beer companies make up 60% of the business’ clients. Stocks of companies such as United Spirits and United Breweries are some of the most expensive stocks listed (P/E of more than 100) as the Street expects the consumption to pick up. HSIL offers a good proxy play at much lower valuations.
 
 “Industry discipline in terms of few furnace shutdowns seen last year should help improve demand-supply fundamentals. Various cost-control measures should yield operating leverage for HSIL as growth revives,” said Saurabh Kumar, analysts with JP Morgan in a recent report. With its strong presence in the high-growth sanitary business and potential turnaround in the glass business, the stock is due for a re-rating. In the past, consumer discretionary companies such as TTK Prestige, Asian Paints and Hawkins that enjoyed similar market positions in their respective industries, have become multi-baggers.

It is also used with readymix concrete to reduce usage of cement in construction. Bain Capital Private Equity had large chemicals businesses in its portfolio in the past, including firms such as Rhodia, paints maker SigmaKalon and Germany’s Trespaphan.Bain Capital private equity India head Amit Chandra could be nominated on the board of Himadri, although a final decision on the issue would be made after the completion of the open offer, which would likely raise Bain’s shareholding to a maximum of 35%, said a person connected with the development. According to Anurag Choudhary, Bain’s association is also to enable his company go global. “We had bid for Germany’s Rutgers in 2007, but withdrew due to high valuations. Now we might revisit our global plans,” he added.The company plans to set up a plant in China’s Shandong province in partnership with a local firm. The Choudharys will own 97% in that Chinese venture. “We want to have a total capacity of 1 mt in 3 years that will make us the top three producer globally,” he added. The focus of the PE deal with Himani, one of the few initiated in 2009, is also the emphasis on domain expertise, a pre-condition that most limited partners in PE funds have been insisting on after valuations plunged post the liquidity crisis. Large investors in a PE firm are referred to as limited partners. They provide capital to be invested in selected assets for returns after, typically, three to five years.A recent survey of major PE limited partners by KPMG, found many of them sought stronger operating skills as the downturn progressed into 2009 and as the falling tide exposed the internal problems of portfolio firms. “As LPs will make clear through their choice of fund managers, it is this factor more than any other that will likely separate the successful PE firm from its peers over the next few years,” said the survey."

Net profit for the October-December period rose to Rs 1,278 crore from Rs 1,140 crore a year earlier, the country’s oldest mortgage lender said.
 
 Net interest margin, or the difference between funding costs and interest earned on loans, was nearly flat at 4 per cent compared with 4.06 per cent a year earlier. Net interest income, which is comparable with revenue for companies in other sectors, rose nearly 16 per cent to Rs 1,829 crore.
 
 While demand for funds has slowed in a weak economy, the housing finance sector has remained somewhat insulated. Individual home buyers, who are driving this demand, have also been repaying their loans regularly, helping lenders offset slippages in other loan categories.
 
 For instance, at HDFC, bad loans in the retail portfolio fell to 0.57 per cent in the December quarter from 0.62 per cent a year earlier. This helped limit its overall non-performing assets – which rose to 0.77 per cent of total loans from 0.75 per cent – despite NPA in the non-individual segment almost doubling to 1.81 per cent.
 
 Vice-chairman Keki Mistry said the lender will focus more on growing its individual loan book. “We expect the loan book to grow in the range of 18-20 per cent,” he said. Mistry predicted its cost of funds to remain flat because “ interest rates are expected to remain stable”.
 
 HDFC’s total outstanding loans grew 19.5 per cent to more thanRs 1.92 lakh crore at the end of December. “Most of the housing finance companies, including HDFC and LIC Housing Finance, have seen growth in loan portfolio,” said Kajal Gandhi, a banking analyst at ICICI Securities.
 
 
 
“We have a positive outlook on the sector.” But competition is intensifying, with banks aggressively targeting the home buyer at a time when demand for funds from other segments of the economy is low. “HDFC has managed to maintain its net interest margin because of its sheer size and good liability management,” said Gandhi.
 
 Rikesh Parikh, vice-president of institutional corporate broking at Motilal Oswal Securities, said HDFC’s plan to focus on smaller cities to boost growth in a slowing economy is a positive sign.
 
 According to him, HDFC’s asset quality has remained healthy over the past several quarters and the trend is likely to continue. The lender’s capital adequacy ratio for the quarter ended December was 19.1 per cent compared with 17.5 per cent a year earlier.

  PUNE: Groundnut oil prices have surged 35% as nut production declined by 25% in 2009-10 due to less rains.
  
  ”The historically highest ever price of Rs 96/kg of groundnut oil was recorded on September 13 in Rajkot market. The prices have come down during the last few days as a new crop is likely to arrive in the market Dusserra onwards,” said GG Patel, an oil broker in Rajkot. The wholesale price of groundnut oil in Rajkot on September 30 was Rs 83/kg. 
  
  Cargill’s Gemini brand refined groundnut oil has an MRP of Rs 135/kg in Pune. However, sources in Cargill said the oil is expected to be sold at Rs 105-110/kg. 
  
  Cargill India spokesperson said, “There is pressure on the supply side as it is the end of the season. The prices will start easing when the new season will begin from October end.”
  
  Groundnut oil, considered a premium variety, accounts for 7-8% of the total edible oil consumption of the country. Gujarat accounts for 40% groundnut production. The rest is produced by Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 
  
  “As groundnut kernels are increasingly being used for direct human consumption, lesser amounts are becoming available for oil extraction,” said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association of India. 
  
  The area under groundnut in 2010-11 has increased by five lakh hectares to 49.44 lakh hectare from 44.24 lakh hectare in the previous year. 
  
  The production of groundnut oil is expected to increase from 15 lakh tonne to 16 lakh tonne in 2009-10 to 20 lakh tonnes in 2010-11. The area under the crop remains constant in Gujarat and Maharashtra while it has gone up in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/four-wheelers-propel-growth-for-greaves-cotton/articleshow/32816242.cms,m.economictimes.com,Four wheelers propel growth for Greaves Cotton,"For Greaves Cotton, sliding sales volumes of three-wheelers since the quarter to March FY12 was a major worry, since it was a major supplier of engines to three-wheelers. Three-wheeler sales volumes were severely impacted as freight operators moved to lower horse power, or HP, four-wheeler vehicles such as Tata Motors Ace and M&M Gio, which are classified as small commercial vehicles, or SCVs. 

 The Greaves Cotton management then decided to shift focus from the three-wheeler companies to the SCV segment, hoping this would deliver revenue growth higher than its core business catering to three-wheelers. Through the “hub & spoke” model, which involves transporting goods through highways by heavy vehicles and then using small vehicles for city roads, the company supplied SCV engines to Tata Motors for Ace Zip and the Magic Iris model. 

 The company’s SCV engine volumes now account for 14 per cent of its total engine volumes, compared with a negligible contribution three years ago. Says Sunil Pahilajani, MD & CEO, Greaves Cotton, “Our focus has changed to auto original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) side, from being a threewheeler supplier to a complete solution provider to the SCV segment. In trying times, our focus has been on adding to the product range, adding more customers and to enter various categories.” 

 After Pahilajani took charge of the company two years ago, he ensured there was a CEO for each segment and spun off the after-sales segment as a separate division. Revenue from the after-sales segment now accounts for 15% of the company’s total revenue and it enjoys a high margin compared to the other segments. Given the economic slowdown, which impacted volumes of power gensets and the industrial engines segment, the company targeted augmenting revenues from the after-sales segment and to increase its exports. 

 “We are able to maintain revenue growth from the after-sales segment, when industry players have seen a significant dip in revenues from this vertical. Revenue from after-sales has partially offset pressures emanating from other verticals,” said Pahilajani. He said the company is planning to increase revenue contribution from the export market to 10% in the next three years from 3% now. The company’s plant now works at 70 per cent capacity utilisation. 

 In the next few quarters, Greaves Cotton’s farm equipment segment is expected to do well and its contribution to the company’s total revenues is expected to rise as the company is making inroads into the electric pump-set market, which has a market size of.`3,000 crore. Besides, the company has a 50% market share in the petrol and kerosene market and has 1,000 retail touch points in India. It also plans to grab market share in the highly fragmented electric pump market. 

 But what could be a big threat to the company in the next few quarters is the possibility of revenue growth being affected if auto companies start manufacturing engines themselves. Besides, a heavy monsoon, drought or floods can also impact its revenue growth. More importantly, the company’s revenue growth is linked to the revival of the road sector, which has been struggling owing to a fall in traffic, high interest rates and policy paralysis. 

 According to Bloomberg data, the company’s revenues and profits are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% and 23 per cent, respectively, in the FY09-15 period. Greaves Cotton has attracted considerable interest from domestic mutual funds, based on its high earnings potential in the coming years. Fund houses such as Reliance and IDFC hold 8 per cent and 5 per cent stake, respectively, in the company.

Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/greaves-cotton-set-to-flourish-with-improving-margins/articleshow/48721599.cms,m.economictimes.com,Greaves Cotton set to flourish with improving margins,"Greaves Cotton saw a 10% fall in revenue year on year (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2015-16. The exit from the infrastructure equipment business is the main reason behind this fall in revenue. Delayed recovery in four-wheeler small commercial vehicle segment and a sluggish growth in farm equipment segment, due to slow release of subsidies and small increase in minimum support price, have also contributed to this revenue contraction. But, despite the fall in revenue, the company has impressed the market because of a robust growth in profit.
 
 
Improvement in margins helped the company report an adjusted net profit growth of 22% y-o-y. The reported net profit growth is up 51% y-o-y. The net profit this time also contains a one-time profit related to the sale of properties. The 527 basis points margin improvement, y-o-y, in the first quarter, is largely attributable to Cotton Greaves’s exit from the infrastructure equipment business, which was making continuous losses at the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) level. Improved operational efficiencies, such as reduction in material and employee costs, further contributed to better margins.
 
 Though Greaves Cotton is into the manufacturing of engines that work on almost all fossil fuels—petrol, diesel, kerosene—and can used in automobiles—threewheelers, four-wheeler small commercial vehicles—fishing boats, agri pumps, etc., most of its revenue comes from the automobile segment. Greaves Cotton, with a market share of 85%, is the biggest player in the three-wheeler auto segment.
 
 To augment its auto engine business further, the company has developed engines that can be fitted on vehicles weighing up to 3.5 tonne, a major jump from the previous level of 0.8 tonne. The company should see a significant improvement in its four-wheeler engine market share, currently at 14%, in the coming years. In July, the company signed a deal with Eicher-Polaris for its 600 cc four-wheeler vehicle, Multix, and is trying to get one more four-wheeler company on board during this financial year. Besides new tie-ups, a ramp up in volumes from existing partners is also possible, given the increase in the company’s engine offerings.
 
 
The future looks extremely bright for Greaves Cotton and as per the consensus analysts’ estimate, its net profit is expected to zoom to Rs 211 crore in 2016-17, an annualised 59% gain compared to 2014-15. This fast-growing company’s stock is quoting at reasonable valuations and, therefore, investors can buy it for long-term investment.

 At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in far-month June rose by Rs 101, or 0.36 per cent to Rs 28,490 per ten gram in business turnover of 52 lots. 

 Similarly, the yellow metal for delivery in April gained Rs 80, or 0.28 per cent to Rs 28,795 per ten gram in 1960 lots. 

 Analysts attributed the rise in gold prices at futures trade to a firming trend in the overseas markets on speculation that the US economic recovery may be stalling, boosted demand for the precious metal. 

 Meanwhile, gold traded marginally higher at 1,257.96 dollar an ounce from 1,257.92 dollar yesterday in Singapore.

Though jewellery sales gathered momentum, the metal lost its lustre among investors as a lucrative instrument to park funds. Bullion dealers said there has been panic selling as news spread that gold has entered a bearish mode. 

 Rajiv Popley, director of Mumbai-based Popley & Sons, said: “Demand has surged at least by 15-20% in the past two days. Buyers are placing orders for Akshay Tritiya which is on May 13. We also had a good Gudi Padwa, which marks the beginning of the new year according to the Hindu calendar.” 

 What is enthusing the jewellers is that consumers are buying jewellery for own use and not for weddings and festivals. “This is a good sign for jewellers. We are seeing that demand has drifted from diamond-studded jewellery to pure gold jewellery. The ratio of gold jewelley to gold investment products is now 65:35. But at this level investment demand is likely to fall by 50%,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director, Nemichand Bamalwa, and past chairman of All India Gem and Jewellery Trade Federation. 

 In 2012, jewellery demand in India slipped to 552 tonne from 618.3 tonne in 2011 largely due to rising prices. 

 The import price rose because the rupee weakened against the dollar, pushing up the landed cost of the metal. Investment demand in 2012 was at 312.2 tonne, which slipped from 368 tonne in 2011, according to World Gold Council data. 

 Bullion dealers say jewellers are not entering the market though the price has fallen as they would like to liquidate the inventories first. “There is hardly any buying from jewellers as there is a feeling that prices will come down to Rs 24,200 per 10 gm. Silver is expected to fall to Rs 39,000 per 1 kg,” said Suresh Hundia, director, Hundia Exports, a leading Mumbai -based bullion dealer. 

 In Bangalore, demand for jewellery has surged by 30% in the past two days. Venkatesh Babu, owner of Bangalore-based Chetna Jewellers & Bullion, said: “Footfall has increased and consumers are buying gold for their own use. However, investors are staying away at the moment and they are waiting for the price to stabilise.” 

 Analysts say gold may bounce back to Rs 26, 000 in the near term. Kishore Narne, associate director & head, Commodity & Currency, Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker, said the plunge in gold prices seems to be ending as it has broken all near-term supports and had a free fall over the last two trading sessions. 

 “The next big support for gold exists at $1,310 and we expect that support to hold for the near term,” he said.“A pullback towards $1,400 an ounce looks possible and holding above that can extend it towards $1,440. The crash in gold prices is close to the near term bottom and will start to see pullback and consolidation. 

 Gold will take support between Rs 25,200-25,100 and can bounce from there towards Rs 25,800-26,000. Sustaining below Rs 25,000 can push the prices towards Rs 24,500-24,200 in the coming days. 

 Silver has given up all gains over the last 2 years and will continue to trade weak. Pullbacks look due and can extend towards Rs 45,000-45,500 per kg,” he added.

The global economic crisis and the resultant volatility have led to the need for diversification of portfolios and increased the importance of risk management. It’s during such times that gold’s fundamental characteristics stand out as a hedge against inflation and preserver of wealth.

Besides, there is a continued erosion of purchasing power of the world’s key currencies, rising inflation and, of late, the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. Little wonder then that the metal has risen since 2002.

According to the World Gold Council's (WGC) latest report, the global demand in the second quarter of 2012-13 stood at 990 tonne, down 7% on a year-on-year basis due to the weak demand in jewellery, investment and technology. The net buying trend by banks, which started in the second quarter of 2009, continued in this quarter as well. The demand by central banks and official institutions in the developing countries increased 63% to 157.5 tonne. Gold's cultural heartland, India and China, continued to dominate the consumer demand segment, contributing 45% to the total jewellery, bar and coin demand.

The consumer demand for gold in China for the second quarter of 2012 was 145 tonne, down 7% y-o-y due to the economic slowdown and lack of a clear price trend. In the first quarter of 2012, the demand rose to a record 255.2 tonne, overtaking that of India. In India, the monetary tightening, rapid depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, economic slowdown, stubborn inflation, high interest rates and fear of weak monsoons curtailed the gold demand as prices touched a record high of Rs 31,422 per 10 gm.

The upward trend has continued since 2000 and gold has performed well compared with other asset classes, with a CAGR of 17% from 2000 through 2011 and a notable 22% during 2010 and 2011. Gold has posted a 13% year-to-date return, whereas the Sensex yielded 12% during this period.

India's gold imports rose to 969 tonne, amounting to $60 billion in 2011-12, pushing the current account deficit to a record $78.2 billion, 4.2% of the GDP, due to the rupee depreciation. This prompted the government to hike import duty on gold to 4% of the value in March 2012. Since then, gold imports have declined 37% to 131 tonne during April-June 2012, according to the WGC report. The consumer demand stood at 181.3 tonne for the second quarter of 2012, down 38% on a y-o-y basis. However, the assets under management of the 14 gold ETFs in India touched Rs 10,300 crore in May 2012, from Rs 5,463 crore a year ago. However, according to GFMS, the imports to India may fall 26% to 650-750 tonne in 2012.


				


Gold prices inched to an all-time high at just above $1,920 per ounce in September 2011 amid concerns about western economies. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has strengthened, adversely impacting the prices in global markets.

	 

doweshowbellyad = 0;

The yellow metal touched a low of $1,538 per ounce in May 2012 due to the sovereign debt crisis in the Euro-zone, and is currently trading at $1,690 per ounce. The prices have moved in a range with slight ups and downs. Presently, gold prices are tracking the global sentiment and moving in tandem with the riskier assets.


				


In August this year, after the US Federal Reserve Annual Symposium, and comments from the Fed chairman about the continuation of accommodative polices in the US, the metal surged to a five-month high of $1,693 per ounce.


				


The global demand is expected to strengthen in the future, triggered by the hope of monetary easing in the US, and positive outcome of the European Central Bank meeting on 6 September, which announced an unlimited bond buying program to fix Eurozone countries' borrowing costs. It could weaken the US dollar, increasing the investment in gold. On the domestic front, the demand will depend on the rupee depreciation and policy measures. The rain deficiency is likely to fall, driving gold demand in rural areas. It may also gain strength due to the festive/wedding season during October-December.

 The Mumbai-headquartered company had posted a net profit of Rs 208.58 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.
 
 The company, however, said its net profit for the quarter is not comparable due to out-licensing income of Rs 111.23 crore received in the corresponding quarter last year and also due to mark-to-market losses to the extent of Rs 55 crore recorded in the first quarter of 2012-13 fiscal, PTI reported.
 
 “However, the core net profit (excluding the out-licencing income and the forex loss/gain) jumped by 44.3 per cent YoY to Rs129.6 crore,” Sharekhan said in a report.

 “The specialty business includes the Indian formulation business, which grew by 24.1 per cent YoY during the quarter. Though the growth rate is better than the industry growth rate of 15%, it falls short of our expectation,” Sharekhan reported.
 
 The brokerage firm maintains a ‘buy’ recommendation on the counter with a target price of Rs 468 for a 12-month timeframe.
 
 The company posted revenues of Rs 392.35 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2012, mainly driven by generic business. The revenues stood at Rs 251.15 crore during the same period of the previous fiscal.

  NEW DELHI: NYSE-listed BPO firm Genpact on Thursday upped its sales growth forecast for the year to 23% from 13% announced last quarter, buoyed by its recent acquisition of IT firm Headstrong and an improved market for outsourcing in the US. The BPO firm, which counts Wachovia, Wells Fargo and GE as top clients, posted a 28% rise in net profit to $36 million for the first quarter ended March 31. Sales of $331 million for the quarter also beat street expectations. Analysts were expecting sales of $326 million.
  
  
  ""Revenues from business process management services continue to be our growth engine,"" said Pramod Bhasin, Genpact's President and CEO. Revenue growth from GE, Genpact's largest client, almost remained flat at 0.7% from the same period last year. GE contributes about 34% to Genpact's sales.
  
  
  Genpact counts BPO firms WNS and EXL Service as its competitors, which have been on the block. Genpact on the other hand is trying to integrate IT services into its portfolio, to up its sales growth stagnated by flattish contribution from its largest client GE. Genpact's sales had grown 12% last year compared to the Indian BPO industry's growth of about 15%. 
  
  
  IT companies in India, however, grew about 27% last year. The company bought Noida-based IT firm Headstrong for $550 million last month, whose sales will be accounted for in next few quarters. Genpact will gain clients like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley with the buyout.
  
  
  Current revenues from IT services for Genpact were about 13% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2011. About 87% of Genpact's revenues for the quarter came from business process management services, up from 85% for the first quarter of 2010.
  
  
  An improved market for outsourcing has also led to rise in attrition for BPOs. Genpact's employee attrition rate for the quarter was 29%, up from 23% for the same period in 2010. As of March 31, 2011, Genpact had about 45,500 employees worldwide, an increase from 41,300 as of March 31, 2010. The firm's revenue per employee increased from $29,900 in the first quarter of 2010 to $30,700 in the quarter ending March this year. The $76-billion Indian IT-BPO industry is projected to grow about 18% this year.

  The stock of Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) rose by 3% in a weak broader market on Thursday after news of the merger of its fully owned subsidiary Godrej Household Products (GHPL) with itself. GCPL has a strong position in north India and GHPL is strong in the southern region. 
  
  The integration will help the company achieve economies of scale with higher cost synergies, better product portfolio and a stronger distribution network. 
  
  Godrej Household Products was initially a joint venture between Godrej Consumer Products and the US-based Sara Lee and Body Care. Recently, GCPL bought the 51% stake of Sara Lee and formed GHPL. 
  
  GHPL earns a major part of its revenue from home insecticides such as Good Knight and Hit. In FY10, GHPL had a total revenue of Rs 950 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 150 crore. Since GCPL earlier had only 49% stake in GHPL, it contributed a little less than 25% of the profits. 
  
  Post merger, the home insecticide business would roughly have a 40% share. Hence, the merger will help GCPL to reduce its dependence on soap products and also tackle high raw material cost caused by inflation in the soap segment.
  
  The timing of the acquisition, which took place in May-end just before the monsoons, may improve the topline of GCPL in the September quarter. According to a Tata Securities report, there is a very high correlation between monsoons and the insecticide industry. 
  
  Godrej Consumer’s net sales have more than doubled due to a series of acquisitions in the past. The company mainly operates in the personal wash, hair products and insecticides segments and aspires to grow big in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
  
  The recent acquisitions of Indonesia-based Megasarai, Africa-based Tura, and Latin America-based Issue and Argencos confirm the company’s ambition. In the past 3 months, GCPL’s stock price has increased by only 7.5% as against the 14.5% increase in the broader market Sensex. 
  
  At the current market price of Rs 401, the stock is trading at a consolidated price-earnings ratio of 33.2.

ET Now: The management of GCPL has just talked about a further improvement in the domestic market share. Is that the only trick available now?
 
 
Prakash Diwan: GCPL is not focused entirely on the domestic market.
 
 The FMCG company is insulated from the volume de-growth concerns that we have with other top FMCG companies.
 
 The company has taken a considerable time to establish itself in new geographies — the African and the South East Asian markets.
 
 It is placed second or at top slot in most of the segments that it is into. That is where you get pricing power. In such a scenario, a company like GCPL does not have to promote itself.
 
 Hence, the advertising and promotions (A&P) expenses come down significantly. In other words, selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) for the company is quite low.
 
 That is exactly what a higher market share helps you with. The cost of retaining market share should be too primitively high, which some of the domestic companies are dealing with. GCPL is surely one of the relatively undervalued stocks.
 
 You can anytime compare it with stocks such as Hindustan Unilever, Marico and Britannia. That is why this stock attracts a lot of interest.

GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/gail-to-benefit-most-from-rasgas-price-tweak/articleshow/49899602.cms,m.economictimes.com,GAIL to benefit most from RasGas price tweak,"ET Intelligence Group: Stocks of gas distributing companies including GAIL, Petronet LNG, Gujarat Gas, Indraprastha Gas and GSPL have risen by 13 per cent on average in a week now that renegotiation of gas prices with RasGas, a Qatar-based gas company, is turning from hope to reality. GAIL shot up 25 per cent making it the world’s best performing utility stock previous week since the company is expected to be a major beneficiary of such a renegotiation.
 
 There are three major changes in the renewed contract with RasGas, according to news reports. First, gas prices have been linked to three month average price of crude oil compared with a period of 12 months earlier. In addition to this, cap and floor have been removed from the gas pricing methodology. This means gas price will fall by half to $6-7/mmbtu from current level. Second, RasGas will postpone the recovery of liability of $1.5 billion of lesser offtake of 2015 and liability burden will be recovered in the next 13 years of remaining contract. The third factor is that the proportion of crude oil to compute gas price — in technical parlance known as slope — has been changed.
 
 Among Indian companies, GAIL will benefit on two counts. One, more gas will flow from its pipelines, which will accrue more transmission revenues. Second, lower raw material price for petrochemical division. Analysts reckon that every $1/mmbtu fall in gas price will lift GAIL’s Earning per share (EPS) for the next year by Re 1. This means price fall of $5/mmbtu will add another Rs 560 crore profitability for the GAIL.
 
 

 
 Petronet LNG will benefit since there will be no liability of $1.5 billion emerging from take or pay (ToP) clause and gradually longterm volume will move to normal level thus, lifting the utilisation of the Dahej terminal.
 
 Apart from these, gas distributors such as IGL, Gujarat Gas could also gain on the RasGas contract as this gas constitutes 10-15 per cent of their gas mix and cater to their industrial customers. Pure transporters like GSPL, while not direct beneficiaries, as they were not meaningfully impacted in the first place, could be indirect longer-term gainers as any renegotiation is a tacit acknowledgement of the LNG market having structurally changed, which should benefit importing countries like India.

Rajesh Subramaniam helped Firstsource execute a perfect turnaround,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rajesh-subramaniam-helped-firstsource-execute-a-perfect-turnaround/articleshow/28608376.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rajesh Subramaniam helped Firstsource execute a perfect turnaround,"Firstsource, one of the India's top three business process outsourcing companies, has been through hell and back. Investors, bondholders, lenders and even its employees had given up on the company in 2011: its stock had crashed to a mere Rs 10 in 2011 from Rs 70 in 2008, the company was grappling with rising debt, and facing an outstanding FCCB payment. It had no earnings to get out of this mess.

It was when Rajesh Subramaniam, who had resigned from Firstsource in 2008, was asked to come back and rescue the ship. In August 2012, Subramaniam was appointed the managing director and CEO, and since then, he has scripted an almost perfect turnaround story. Subramaniam helped the company repay debt and FCCB, consolidated facilities, broke operational silos, realigned sales functions, renegotiated unviable client agreements, and rationalise cost.

""Few months after I rejoined, we realised the magnitude of breakdown in internal governance. A lot of things had collapsed and all our stake holders had lost confidence,"" recalls Subramaniam.

""We reassessed all the assets and systems and came out with a viable option to bring Firstsource back on track,"" he said. This included realigning the processes, rationalising employee structure and renegotiating with all the clients.

Twelve months down the line, Firstsource had a new life - and a new promoter: RPG Group's Sanjiv Goenka acquired Firstsource in 2012. There were others who were interested. Vedanta Group CFO Tarun Jain and Rakesh Jhunjunwala, known as India's Warren Buffett, put in money.

Using the cash from preference allotment to promoters and other internal accruals, the company was able to pay back $237 million, or Rs 1,300 crore, FCCB in 2012. Then the company undertook various restructuring exercises: it weeded out non-profitable customers - mostly Indian clients with low margins - and identified areas of growth, especially the healthcare industry in the US.

Under the new leadership, Firstsource's profit after tax more than doubled to Rs 146 crore in FY13 from Rs 62 crore a year ago, and the stock has more than trebled to Rs 24 at present from its low of Rs 8 in 2011. The debt has also halved to Rs 1,000 crore.

But the best is yet to come, according to the new chief. ""Last year we emerged, this year we will consolidate, and next year we will start growing,"" said Subramaniam.

	 
""In the current fiscal, the company is expecting a profit after tax of over Rs 180 crore. In the next fiscal, we will grow by at least 12-15%, our operating margins will also increase by another 200 basis points and our net debt will be less than $80 million, or Rs 500 crore,"" he said.

This seems feasible given the company's focus on healthcare and insurance sectors, which account for almost 35-40% of its revenues. ObamaCare, as it is popularly known, mandates that its citizens buy health insurance in 2014 or else face penalty. This could bring 30 million Americans into the insurance net, and implies incremental volumes for both hospitals and insurers. ""We are very excited about this and are expecting a growth of over 15% in our healthcare business process outsourcing,"" said Subramaniam.

Although the company's stock has run up by over 100% in the past year, it is still trading at an attractive valuation. It is trading at FY14 price-to-earnings multiple of 9 and FY15 P/E multiple of 6.5, which is quite cheap compared with other IT peers which are trading at multiples of over 10.

""FSL continues to be an attractive story for value investors given the debt repayment roadmap, which itself could translate into market-cap gains,"" said Abhishek Shindadkar, IT analyst with ICICI Direct. ""Going by the current rate, the company will end FY16 with a net cash of at least Rs 300 crore,"" he added.

Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/facebook-rally-has-analysts-gasping-for-breath/articleshow/31859756.cms,m.economictimes.com,Facebook rally has analysts gasping for breath,"By Sarah Frier
 
 SAN FRANCISCO: Wall Street analysts are racing to keep up with Facebook’s stock rally. Shares of the world’s biggest social network have jumped 32% so far this year, compared with a 1.6% gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The surge has left the 49 analysts who cover Facebook in a bind -- while 38 of them recommend the company with the equivalent of a buy rating, 21 of the total now have share-price targets below where Facebook is trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That translates into an average 12-month price target of $72.46 for Facebook, less than 1% above the company’s closing price of $72.03 on Monday. 

 With the stock advancing more rapidly than anticipated, the price targets -- many of which were calculated in 2014, with several dating back to last year - - would suggest that analysts on average see little upside to the stock. That may force some of the bulls to adjust their projections, with two analysts boosting their price forecasts on Monday. 

 “Facebook stock has just ripped past expectations,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG in New York, who in October recommended buying the shares with a $68 target over the next 12 months. At the time, Facebook was trading at $49. “We’re very happy with our rating upgrade to buy, but it has all happened super fast,” he said. 

 
FACEBOOK’S TURNABOUT 

 In Germantrading on Tuesday, the stock rose less than 1% to the equivalent of $72.52 at 10:58 a.m. in Frankfurt. Facebook’s stock surge underscores how the company’s prospects have improved following its rocky stock-market debut in May 2012. 

 Chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg weathered a 50% drop in the company’s stock price in the months after its initial public offering at $38, as investors questioned whether Facebook could come up with a mobile strategy with users increasingly accessing the social network from smartphones and tablets. Since then, Facebook has pushedinto mobile advertising. In January, it reported quarterly results that beat estimates, with more than half of ad revenue coming from mobile devices. Last month, Facebook ramped up its mobile business by agreeing to purchase WhatsApp for as much as $19 billion in cash and stock, betting on the mobile-messaging startup’s large international user base to accelerate growth. 

 
UNANIMOUS ANALYSIS 

 While it isn’t unheard of for a company to trade above its average analyst price target Facebook stands out because of how analysts almost unanimously agree their clients should buy the stock.

 The stock rose 12.72 per cent to hit a high of Rs 4.43 on the BSE.

 According to the company's FY15 annual report, the company’s total debt was in excess of Rs 10,000 crore as of March 31, 2015. 

 In the September quarter results, the company had informed exchanges that due to continuous losses and excess of current liabilities over current assets, its net worth had fallen by around 50 per cent. 

 The company reported a net loss of Rs 624 crore for FY15. Net loss for the H1FY16 stood at Rs 389 crore.

Whether that probably translates into ARPUs on an existing scale going forward and compounding as was the quarters go by, is something that time will decide. So our probable take is that if you are looking within this space, DTH, media, print media, we still prefer to go with the guys in the print media space.

Deepak Fertilisers bets on chemicals to deliver growth,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/deepak-fertilisers-bets-on-chemicals-to-deliver-growth/articleshow/30300794.cms,m.economictimes.com,Deepak Fertilisers bets on chemicals to deliver growth,"Deepak Fertilisers & Petrochemicals (DFPCL), a leading manufacturer of ammonium nitrate - an industrial explosive as well as a fertiliser used in agriculture - is set to benefit from the government's regulations on production, trade and imports of the chemical. The company more than doubled its capacity of ammonium nitrate in FY14, and is expanding other businesses as well.
 
 In 2012, the government had introduced ammonium nitrate rules to regulate production, transportation and warehousing of this material, when it became apparent that some people were using it for harmful purposes. The regulations became applicable from January 2014, mandating KYC norms for customers as well as transporters, numbered bagging and GPS-enabled transportation, among other things.
 
 ""The new rules are expected to increase the cost of import since ammonium nitrate is required to be imported in bagged condition,"" said Shailesh Mehta, the company's chairman and managing director. It commissioned 300,000-tonne capacity in FY14 to take its total capacity to 470,000 tonne, when India's annual consumption of technical ammonium nitrate (TAN) stands at around 700,000 tonne, growing at 7-8%.
 
 

 
 The company recorded a 33% jump in its TAN volumes in the first nine months of FY14, which emerged as the single-largest revenue earner for the company at nearly 25% of total revenues.
 
 ""Our TAN capacity utilisation stands at around 60% at present, which will go up to 80-90% in FY15,"" said Somnath Patil, president and chief financial officer of the company.
 
 The company's other specialty chemical Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), a solvent used in pharma and paint industries, has also come up well contributing 20% to the company's total turnover. This unit is already working at 100% capacity utilisation at its 70,000-tonne plant.
 
 ""The IPA requirement in the domestic market is increasing by around 6-7% from the present level of 1,10,000 tonne. Therefore, another similar plant will be needed to serve domestic requirement. We are evaluating various options for increasing capacity,"" said Mehta.
 
 Thanks to these two chemicals, in addition to nitric acid and methanol, the company's industrial chemicals segment has emerged a faster growing business with better margins, compared with the fertiliser.
 
 The company is also investing in agri-inputs business. ""We are expanding fertiliser capacity at Taloja from the existing 2.29 lakh tonne to 6-lakh tonne. This will also allow us to produce different grades of complex fertilisers as well as fortified fertilisers,"" said Mehta.
 
 There are two main concerns ahead for the company. First, the likely increase in natural gas prices from April ’14 will need raising retail prices of the fertilisers it sells, which may hamper volume growth in the short term. Second, its real estate project — a specialty mall in Pune named Ishanya — is losing money. The company is working on its turnaround, but with little success so far.
 
 Notwithstanding these worries, the company’s FY15 numbers will be significantly better than the current year. This visibility on recovery and inexpensive valuations are making the company attractive to investors. Six out of eight brokerage houses tracking the company hold a ‘Buy’ recommendation, according to Bloomberg data.
 
 “Deepak is currently trading at 4.7 times its expected FY15 earnings, which is at a discount of 30% to its long-term average,” said a report from brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher. “Dividend yield of 5% prevents further downside risk,” it added. Investors will do well to stay with the company.

  ""Our capex for this fiscal, which includes our domestic expansion as well as setting up of the new factories, is around between Rs 100 crore to Rs 200 crore,"" a company official said. 
  
  The company said the expansion plans are in line with its growth target to achieve a revenue of Rs 5,000 crore by this fiscal. 
  
  ""We will introduce more products in Africa as we look to expand our presence in the overseas market,"" Duggal said, without specifying the kind of products it plans to launch in the region. 
  
  Dabur, which sells personal care and healthcare products under brands like Dabur and Vatika, had a sales of Rs 4,110 crore. Around 22 per cent of the company's sales come from international operations. 
  
  ""In the current year we expect 28 per cent of sales coming from the overseas as the benefit of our recent acquisitions will start kicking in,"" Duggal said. 
  
  In September, 2010, the company had completed acquisition of Turkish personal care firm Hobi Kozmetik Group for USD 69 million (about Rs 324 crore) to strengthen its presence in West Asia and North Africa. 
  
  Dabur is expecting that in three years' time, international operations will contribute around 35 per cent to its overall sales, he added.

  MUMBAI: Corporation Bank has posted a 20% rise in net profit in the second quarter of this fiscal year. “The main drivers of profit growth have been net interest margin and healthy credit growth,” pointed out Corporation Bank CMD RN Pradeep, who recently took charge of the bank in September. The net profit stood at Rs 352 crore. 
  
  He said the bank has decided to focus on improving the share of low-cost deposits, which is now one-fourth of their total deposits. Low-cost deposits , include current and savings account, or CASA, wherein banks pay only 3.5% interest. “ 
  
  We have told all our corporate customers that you must give me my share of CASA by opening salary account of your employees in my bank,” said Mr Pradeep. “We are only saying that employees of at least one division or one unit of the company should have salary account with us. We have gained some share on account of this,” the bank’s share of CASA on a yearon-year basis has improved by 100 basis points from 24% to 25%. 
  
  Meanwhile, the bank’s net interest income stood at Rs 715 crore, up 42% while non-interest income fell 25% to Rs 226 crore, down from Rs 302 crore a year ago in the same quarter. Net interest margins — the difference between the cost of funds and yield on advances — stood 2.64% compared with 2.30% a year ago.

Gross NPAs stood at Rs 740 crore against Rs 626 crore a year ago while net NPAs rose to Rs 269 crore against Rs 153 crore in the comparable period. The rise in bad loans was attributed to one account in the real estatecum-engineering sector turning bad. 
  
  “We had an exposure of Rs 54 crore and we decided to fully provide for it,” Said Mr Pradeep. Sources form the bank said the loan account was of Zoom Developers where a number of banks have cumulative exposure of Rs 2,000 crore. 
  The bank’s provision for bad loans stood at Rs 97.6 crore against Rs 93.9 crore a year ago.

  Biocon, what are the kind of targets that we need to watch out for?
  
  In this particular market definitely the defensives that is the healthcare segment like something Glaxo, Sun Pharma and Biocon are definitely doing well in this market. So right now it is very prudent to stick to these kind of defensive sectors mainly being healthcare and we have recommend a buy on Biocon only above 407 for a target of 417 and keeping a stop loss of approximately 402, so definitely a good buy but only above 407.

 There was a time when anything which had software in its name did very well 1999-2000 and then in 2003-2004 where anything which had infrastructure in its name did extremely well - whether or not they had something to do with infrastructure. 

 “This is the age of Bharat and everything that appears to have Bharat in its name is doing extremely well and chances are that they will keep on doing well,” said Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com. 

 “There is one investing principle that investors could use - anything that doubles once chances are that it will double again and again and again that is the power of compounding,” he added. 

 Most of the stocks which have 'Bharat' in their name are government-owned companies which are already trading way below their respective peak valuations. 

 However, most of these stocks have doubled in the last three months on the prospects of pro-growth reforms from the new government to kick start investment cycle and boost growth in Asia’s third largest economy. 

 Another reason highlighted by analysts is that most of these companies have fallen out of favour in the last decade due to unfavourable government policies. 

 PSUs mcap has shrunk to 20 per cent of BSE 100 at present compared with 32 per cent in March 2005. Lower proportion of mcap offers significant room to investors to increase exposure and secure risk-reward ratio, ET reported. 

 “If government can take hard decisions, then the Indian growth story is here to stay and most stocks under the name Bharat may very well outperform benchmark indices,” said A K Prabhakar, Independent Market Expert. 

 “Most of the Bharat stocks are PSUs other than BHARAT FORGE and have the potential to become multibaggers from current levels,” he added.

  KOLKATA: Riding on the retail boom, shoe major Bata India has clocked a 35.39% rise in net profit in Q4 of calendar 2010. The net profit soared to Rs 34.39 crore in Q4 of CY10 as compared to Rs 25.40 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The net sales of the company has shown a 23.5% growth to Rs 355.85 crore as compared to Rs 288.09 crore in Q4 of CY09. 
  
  At 9:45 am, shares of the company were trading 1.03% up at Rs 352.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The profit-before-tax (PBT) of the company in Q4 of CY10 has gone up by 42.6% to Rs 142.99 crore against Rs 100.26 crore in the same period last year. 
  
  For the entire CY10, Bata India’s net profit has soared to Rs 95.35 crore — growth of 41.84% over the previous year. The net sales of the company in CY10 went up by 14.41% to Rs 1,256.85 crore from Rs 1,090.17 crore in CY09. 
  
  Bata India attributes this growth to the new retail strategy adopted by the company. Bata India Group Managing Director Marcelo Villagran said: “During 2010, we opened 108 stores, each with an area of more than 3,000 sq ft. With separate defined sections, offering hundreds of designs for men, ladies, children and youth, the new Bata stores offer a whole new experience to consumers. Made as per Bata's global design, the new stores use the latest retail designs and best quality furniture that enhance the store's layout and provide for an attractive product display.”

Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/restructuring-helps-bata-india-stay-a-step-ahead/articleshow/7566695.cms,m.economictimes.com,Restructuring helps Bata India stay a step ahead,"
  Bata India's business-model restructuring appears to be paying off well. For the year 2010, the company clocked a growth of 42% in its standalone earnings while net sales grew by 15%. 
  
  Brand repositioning and operational restructuring were the two key areas at the heart of the revamping exercise. The company introduced and expanded high-margin premium brands such as Hush Puppies, North Star and Weinbrenner. It also optimised its chain of retail outlets by opening large-format stores, closing down the less profitable ones and renovating the rest. 
  
  On the operational front, the company began outsourcing the production of its low-cost merchandise. The key benefit of this move was a steady reduction in the overall raw material cost to 46.1% of net sales in 2010 from 48.1% three years ago. Besides, it also brought down staff costs to 13.9% of sales from 20.6% during the same period. The company is expanding its retail outlets network to enhance market reach. In 2010, it opened 108 stores, taking the total count to 1,300. It plans to open 50-60 stores in tier-II and tier-III cities annually to increase market penetration. It has also launched new complementary services such as online shopping and Bata Home Delivery service. 
  
  The benefits of these steps are already visible in the company's operating profit margins, which has improved from 8.6% in 2007 to 14% in 2010. The December quarter proved to be the best of the year, with the company clocking a year-on-year net sales growth of 23% compared with the average 11.3% year-on-year growth for the first three quarters. The operating margin for the quarter at 17.3% was also the highest; for the first three quarters, the average was 12.7%. 
  
  The company is also trying to become an approved supplier to the armed forces. It has acquired technology from its parent company to make shoes as required by the defence personnel. The demand from the domestic defence forces alone stands at 1.2 million pairs every year; if it is approved as a supplier, Bata's earnings would get a substantial boost. Another revenue booster will be development of its 260-acre land in Batanagar, near Kolkata, in a 50:50 joint venture with the Calcutta Metropolitan Group. Bata India has deployed around 73 crore since 2007 for setting up a township; the first phase is expected to be commissioned some time later in 2011. The township is expected to be completed by 2013. 
  
  Given the company's growth, the current price-to-earning multiple of 23 does not seem high.

  Seshadri Bharathan, MD & CEO, KSEMA Fincon Ltd. in an interview with ET Now talks about commodity stocks.
  
  
  All these commodity related stories, steel, aluminium, copper, they are all running up this afternoon. How are you reading into the news, what do you make of it? 
  
  With China making the currency flexible, the sense that we are getting is that there would be more purchasing power and with the economy doing well, there would be more demand for base metal. So steel, copper, we will see these base metal prices going up. 
  
  If you look at Sesa Goa particularly, one of the Japanese steel manufactures have increased the purchase price by 23%, most of these companies now work on quarterly contracts. So that augurs well for Sesa Goa. Having said that with China making its currency flexible, we will see lot of liquidity flows happening in the emerging market and we expect the US dollar to depreciate between 3% to 5% in next 3 to 6 months’ time.

 People first started talking seriously about the potential for Apple to become a trillion dollar company in February when shares reached news highs. The current stock price of $127 a share gives the company a valuation of $744 billion. Cantor analyst Brian White currently has the highest price target on Wall Street. 

 It's not just the launch of the Apple Watch that has White so bullish. He's also optimistic about Apple's iPhone portfolio in China, which he says is poised to benefit from a new upgrade cycle following the expanding 4G network, as well as potential new areas of interest such as an electric car. To top that off, he believes Apple will continue to return cash to shareholders, with more coming next month. 

 ""We believe the combination of these forces will drive the market to reward Apple's stock with an expanded P/E multiple, and we are raising our 12-month price target to $180 (~$1T cap; from $160).""

Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/capacity-addition-to-help-apl-apollo/articleshow/6695006.cms,m.economictimes.com,Capacity addition to help APL Apollo,"
  Stock of APL Apollo Tubes, a Delhi-based steel tube manufacturer, has consistently outperformed the markets with yearly returns of 160% compared to a 20% rise in Sensex. The company’s recently commissioned capacities and the planned acquisition of Lloyds Line Pipes is set to give a booster to its earnings in the coming quarters.
  
  Incorporated in 1986, APL Apollo Tubes is a manufacturer and exporter of steel pipes and tubes. It produces a wide range of steel tubes including black tubes, galvanised tubes, pre-galvanised tubes and hollow sections.
  
  The company doubled its production capacity to 4 lakh tonnes per annum by adding a new plant in Hosur. The plant, which was under trial runs till July, will make its presence felt from the September quarter. The new plant will cater to the growing demand from South India.
  
  The company has also forged a strategic partnership with a leading distributor, Shankara Pipes, under which the company will allot around 2% of its equity shares on preferential basis to the latter at `176 each. This is at around 11% premium to its current market price. The relationship is expected to help in increasing the company’s presence in southern and western markets.
  
  At present, the exports account for only about 5% of APL Apollo’s revenue, which the copmany wants to increase going forward.
  
  The recently-announced acquisition of the Maharashtra-based manufacturer of steel tubes and pipes Lloyds Line Pipes for `40 crore, which will be completed later this year, will boost the capacity by 90,000 tonne per annum besides improving access to customers in the Western region.
  
  The company reported net sales growth of 19% y-o-y in the June 2010 quarter. The company, however, saw its profit declining 18% due to presence of other income in the last year’s profit. As the company operates with low operating margins, it depends on volume to boost its profits.
  
  At the current market price of `158 the stock is trading at 15 times to trailing 12-month EPS. This is to a premium to most of its peers. However, considering its recently doubled capacities, the premium appears justified.

  MUMBAI: Allahabad Bank has reported a 21% rise in its net profit at Rs 403 crore for the quarter to September 2010, over Rs 334 crore in the corresponding period last year. Profits were driven by a rise in business, coupled with an improvement in margin. Bank chairman JP Dua attributed the rise to improvement in income from core business.
   
  The bank which saw its total business touch Rs 1.96 lakh crore, aims to cross Rs 2 lakh crore by December and Rs 2.20 lakh crore by March next year, Mr Dua said. The bank’s net interest margin increased to 3.34% for the September quarter compared with 3.10% in the previous quarter. At the start of the fiscal, we announced that we would like to keep NIM over 3%. So far, we have maintained this target, Mr Dua said. 
  
  The Kolkata-based bank’s operating profit for the period rose 20% at Rs 782 crore from Rs 650 crore in the corresponding period in 2009. Total income rose 22% to Rs 2,982 crore against Rs 2,452 crore. It made a provision of Rs 379 crore towards non-performing assets, income tax and others. 
  
  Mr Dua said the bank had to make a whopping Rs 220 crore of provision only towards NPAs on account of agriculture debt relief scheme. The scheme expired on June this year but a significant chunk of farmers did not avail of the benefit, making them defaulters of bank loans. 
  
  Gross NPA ratio deteriorated to 1.77% as on September 2010 from 1.5% three months ago. Net NPAs deteriorated to 0.56% from 0.41% due to rising incidents of defaults in the farm sector. The bank is adequately capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.49%. Yet, it has headroom of Rs 2,600 crore to raise capital.

Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/catch-up-game-bse-mid-cap-index-trails-bigger-peers/articleshow/32635789.cms,m.economictimes.com,Catch-up game: BSE mid-cap index trails bigger peers,"The BSE mid-cap index, which rallied in tandem with the benchmark indices in 2007 to touch an all-time high, has under-performed over the last 18 months as projected earnings growth at the start of FY14 was much lower when calculated on an annualised basis. The projected earnings growth for the BSE mid-cap index in April 2013 was over 25%, which has now been lowered down to 16per cent. Though the benchmark indices are trading at an all-time high, the BSE mid-cap is trading 33per cent away from the lifetime peak it scaled in 2007.
 
 Over the last one year, the BSE mid-cap index has been under-performing the Nifty as most of its constituents have witnessed a gradual downward revision in earnings. The majority of constituents or companies which constitute the BSE mid-cap index have seen a downward revision, as most brokerages had pinned hopes of a recovery in growth from the third quarter of FY14. The brokerages have built in a profit contribution of over 55-60per cent in the second half of FY14, but with little changes in the macro environment and muted demand, they were bound to revise their earnings downward.
 
 According to Bloomberg, the mid-cap index EPS for FY14 has fallen by 20per cent to 485 since September last year. On the other hand, the Nifty’s EPS for FY14 has been upgraded by 9per cent to 452 during the same period. Of the 216 constituents of the BSE mid-cap, only 32 stocks have seen an upward revision of EPS since September 2013.
 
 On the valuation front, the BSE Mid-cap Index is trading at a lower valuation compared with the Nifty. The difference of P/E (price-earning) multiple of two indices, which is known as PE spread shows the amount of premium or discount an investor is willing to pay to buy for a higher risk mid-cap stock.
 
 If the PE spread is lower than the historical average, it indicates that investors are not overtly bullish about the mid-cap stocks compared to benchmark indices with limited prospects for a build-up in the stock. In 2007, on a historical basis, the BSE mid-cap PE (price-earnings) was trading at a premium valuation to the Nifty. The BSE Mid-cap was trading at 23 times in November 2007 when the Nifty traded at 21 times.
 
 Among the constituents of the BSE Midcap, companies whose EPS has been revised upwards, have seen a significant gain since the start of the year. Even the interest of institutional investors such as foreign institutional investors and also mutual funds had been largely concentrated on companies of the BSE midcap constituents where they perceive a fair amount of revenue visibility and see an upward revision in EPS. That is why midcap stocks that rallied recently were the ones whose EPS were upgraded by analysts.
 
 Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Bharat Forge and IPCA have seen a consistent increase in FII holding during the last three quarters. From the start of the year, the BSE mid-cap gained 434 points, of which 80per cent of the contribution came from stocks such as Aurobindo Pharma, Eicher Motors, Apollo Tyres, Bharat Forge, MRF, IPCA, and TVS Motors. Among these, Aurobindo Pharma received the highest EPS upgradation of 23per cent due to which its stock appreciated by 36per cent. Besides this, Apollo Tyres’ stock gained 34per cent as its EPS was upgraded by 21per cent.

 New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, was up nine cents at $95.81 in mid-morning trade while Brent North Sea crude for March gained 26 cents at $106.95. 

 WTI sank 92 cents in New York trade Monday while Brent fell $1.19 in London, tracking heavy losses in global equity markets spurred by weak corporate earnings and uncertainty in emerging economies. 

 Financial markets have also been shaken by data last week indicating manufacturing activity in China -- the world's top energy consumer and a key driver of global growth -- had contracted in January. 

 ""Markets remain skittish and the mood is somewhat cautious as the focus remains on emerging market travails,"" French lender Credit Agricole said in a note. 

 ""The current bout of pressure may yet be contained but there is still some way to go before market stress is alleviated,"" it said. 

 Kelly Teoh, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said investors were also keenly awaiting the outcome of a two-day US Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled to end tomorrow. 

 The US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to decide on a further $10 billion reduction in its monthly asset purchases, to $65 billion. 

 In December, the FOMC said it would begin tapering the stimulus by $10 billion to $75 billion a month in January. 

 The so-called tapering of the Fed's asset purchases would likely boost the greenback, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for countries using other currencies, dampening demand.

 A ratio of over 1 indicates more upgrades than downgrades and could therefore suggest an improving outlook.

Mitesh Thacker: On the index, we still have not changed our stance. But given the fact that we are getting close to the upper end of the range which is around 8300, there is a good chance that we might see some momentum come. In that case we may close above levels of 8300. Lot of individual stocks, specific names are breaking out and giving nice movement. The breadth is about 2.5 is to 1. That is a very positive side. So the chances are that if not today, maybe in the next one-two days, we might get a breakout above 8300. That could possibly suggest further upside in the Nifty in the short term.

 NSE Nifty futures' open interest has been on a decline since March 3, but Bank Nifty futures' aggregate OI remained positive during the same period.Meanwhile, SGX Nifty futures' aggregate open interest remains near the year's peak touched February 26.
 
 Total F&O turnover in Indian exchanges continues to rise after March derivative series became active. Bulk of the action is witnessed in index call options, which are probably seeing unwinding after Nifty hit a peak on March 4. This reasoning is also supported by the rise in the PC ratio of index open interest. It has been on a rise lately, but is still below a year's average.
 PC ratio of stocks' OI is also below average, and there is hardly any stock active in the F&O segment with PC ratio above 1. It is possible that the recent price falls in stocks may have attracted more interest in calls, but such a bias increases the risk of magnifying falls if stocks were to slide further. 

 Meanwhile, FII net equity investment remained positive since February 16. However, the combined trade volume of cash segment in NSE & BSE has remained below a year's average for over two weeks now, suggesting that traders in the equity segment are looking for fresh cues after Budget announcement. 

 India VIX, an indicator of volatility based on the Nifty index option prices is at 17.38, and has been easing since February derivatives' expiry. Open interest distribution across the put-call spectrum of Nifty hints at 8600-9000 as the region that traders have estimated the price moves to be in, in the event of a rise in volatility.

Hold on to IT stocks: Deven Choksey,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/deven-choksey-on-2-stocks-that-can-emerge-multibaggers-in-next-5-years/articleshow/92974035.cms,m.economictimes.com,Deven Choksey on 2 stocks that can emerge as multibaggers in next 5 years,"“In every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money,” says Deven Choksey, MD, KRChoksey Holdings Pvt. Ltd. 

We saw a smart 2% upmove on the Bank Nifty and the IndusInd Bank counter was high by 4.5% yesterday. Kotak Bank was high by almost 3.5% in trade. Has the time for banks finally arrived? We are talking about the capex cycle which can also be played.I guess the time cannot be better than this, wherein it reassures us that the economy is progressing well. Banks are progressing as far as lending is concerned. Up till now, private banks have been concentrating on the retail side of the book, which they continue to do but in the last quarter and a little earlier, from January to March till now and from April to June quarter, systematically the corporate lending side of the book has started increasing.
 
The growth rate in that particular area has also increased. In my view, the corporate credit offtake is taking place at this point of time and no wonder because on one hand, the infrastructure-led spending is happening in the economy and PLI schemes are outside the interactive new investment into the economy. At the same time, most of the companies are getting ready for the next phase of growth – call it Brownfield or Greenfield expansion.
 
All in all, put together, the bank’s credit requirement is on the higher side. At the same time, with the rise in commodity prices, the requirement for working capital has started increasing for most of the corporates and they are again asking banks to fund them. As a result, we had seen the credit offtake. So maybe, the results should reflect into what you call companies earnings in subsequent quarters but the lending activity starts now, the sanctioning of the loans starts now and should this particular thing continue, we are going to see the next two to four quarters reflecting the earnings.
 
With a higher amount of growth, and that is where I would argue that some of the larger banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak, ICICI, need to be considered for the portfolio largely because of the fact that the sheer size is slowing. At the same time, the business condition is improving and these banks remained very disciplined during the pandemic period and did not expand their book, Now they are getting an opportunity to expand their book size with the kind of alpha payment side, I think it is a better time to buy as far as the timing is concerned in the market.
 

Why do you enjoy this reputation that you are never bearish? It is very difficult to find a sell idea from Deven Choksey? We were definitely bullish in every condition because in my career span of more than three decades, at every stage, this market has seen higher amount of growth, whatever the situation in the economy has been. I have done some eight year cycle analysis and I think in every cycle, starting from 1984 to 1992, in 2016 to 2020, in every eight year cycle, there are at least two years which are the worst years and probably these are the times when one can buy and make most of the money. 
 
So I remain bullish of course for the India economy and its growth. Also, we are now probably into the $5-trillion zone, sooner than later and in such a situation, we need to remain bullish because the market cap is likely to double from current levels. All in all, put together, if one wants to make money from the stock market, it is always good to remain an optimist. But things can go wrong even after remaining optimistic.

 

If I have to put a graphic which says Deven’s multibagger idea or ideas for this decade – stocks which can make a lot of wealth in five, six years – which will be those one, two, three names?There are a couple of stocks where I probably keep my focus on currently. I feel HDFC, HDFC Life as a combination is triggering a Rs 50 lakh- crore AUM company. In the next four and a half to five years, should they continue with a growth rate of around 20% odd in the housing finance portfolio, the possibility of continuing with this kind of a growth rate is very high.
 
In retail also, the growth rate on a larger base of AUM will continue to be very high. In the corporate sector, they would be more cautious but I would still think that around 15-16% kind of a growth rate is definitely possible on a larger base. Should this particular portfolio of lending continue to grow at this pace, then on a Rs 50 lakh crore size balance sheet, somewhere in 4.5-5 years time from now, I think this combination could give a nice reward. Even if you compound the return at 25%, you will get a reasonably good amount of appreciation in a four to five years’ time frame. So this is one company which is probably right to buy into. 
 
The second stock where we believe the opportunity is emerging stronger is going to be L&T Technology Services. I would think that beyond the kind of engineering services that they have, coupled with IT and the way the economy is growing and the investment space, would demand higher IT usage after even 5G comes in. This is going to be more of a trusted space. This company is a niche player like Tata Elxsi in the engineering-based IT solutions and that is where I believe that staying with this company for four, five years could give multi bagger returns, something that we have experienced in the case of Tata Elxsi.

  BANGALORE: Hindustan Copper’s chairman and managing director Shakeel Ahmed said on Thursday that nine investment banks have shown interest in managing the firm’s follow-on public offer (FPO). He added that the company will finalise the names before the end of the month. “We are planning our FPO in September or October this year.” 
  
  “Nine banks, including DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak, ICICI Securities, SBI Capital Markets, IDBI, UBS, IDFC-SSKI besides Avendus Capital and Enam, are keen to participate in our fund-raising exercise,” he said. Mr Ahmed clarified that while the FPO will see the company dilute only 20% of its equity, the balance 5-6% will be done subsequently to meet the new minimum public shareholding norm of 25%. Currently a minuscule 0.41% of the company’s equity is traded on the bourses. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said the company was planning to raise funds to partially finance its Rs 4,580- crore capex plans. This investment, which will be done over the next 5-6 years, will see close to 70% funds being raised through equity dilution, the balance being debt and internal accruals. 
  
  The capex will see HCL hiking production capacity at its Khetri (Rajasthan) plant to 3.1 mt from 1 mt. Similarly, the Malanjikhand (Jharkhand) plant’s capacity will rise to 5 mt from the current 2 mt. The Ghatsila (Jharkhand) unit’s new capacity will be 3.9 mt from 0.4-0.6 mt. 
  
  Mr Ahmed said that HCL will expand copper exploration and mining activity as copper consumption has risen due to rapid economic growth. “India’s current consumption is only 5.5 lakh tonne and we lag behind China and the US, which consume 61 lakh tonne and 19 lakh tonne respectively,” he added. He said that the Rajasthan government had recommended the firm’s name for copper mining at Bannivaliki Dhani. HCL was scouting for mines in Chile and Namibia. 
  
  “These are still at a nascent stage. There are a lot of regulatory issues like ownership pattern of the venture, mining rights and the like,” he added. Mr Ahmed said that the company had begun a dialogue with Karnataka’s Hutti Gold Mines to revive the copper mines at Chitradurga. 
  
  “HCL could look at a joint-venture or outright purchase or a supply contract from this mine, which has reserves of nearly 2 mt, and closed in 2001 as global copper prices fell to $ 2,500 per tonne,” he added. HCL shares inched up 0.49% to Rs 495.3 on Thursday.

A target stand at about close to 800-820 and our belief is that the performance that we have seen over the last couple of quarters has been quite consistent though there has been a slight bit of deterioration.

 There has been worry that after the setback suffered by the ruling NDA in the Bihar elections reforms momentum may slow down. 

 “The FDI and disco (distribution companies) announcements highlight how the government can make reform progress using its regulatory and executive powers,” Fitch said in a statement adding that reforms indicate India’s reforms momentum remains intact. 
 

 On Tuesday, in a significant reform of its foreign direct investment policy, the government had opened up as many as 15 sectors more, lifting caps for many sectors, putting others on automatic routed and easing other conditions for others, notably brand retail. 

 The power sector package announced on November 5, seeks to reboot the burdened distribution sector by transferring three-fourth of their debt to respective state government and archiving the rest 25% through long term bonds. 

 “These changes align with the government's broad-based reform agenda, and should support investment and real GDP growth over the long term,” said Fitch, said adding that the two measures suggest government can press ahead with reforms. 

 There is fear that the government will find it difficult to push through legislative reforms after the Bihar setback with emboldened opposition raising the pitch on some of the contentious measures, a point noted by Fitch. 

 It said: “However, other big reforms such as the implementation of a national value added tax, will require a two-thirds approval in the legislature and face stiffer political obstacles.” 

 The government wants to roll out GST from April 1, 2016 but the legislation needed to do so is stuck in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling coalition does not have a majority. 

 The ratings agency has forecast 7.5% growth in the current financial year and 8% each in the next two years. 

 Fitch noted that power package could raise general government debt up to 2% of GDP, but added this was not likely to impact India's ratings because of the positive impact of other reforms. 

 “Importantly, the reforms create an incentive structure for state governments to reduce losses at discos by requiring the state governments to assume a certain share of losses at these entities,” it said.

Such patterns are usually resolved to the upside implying a breakout from the 6,300-6,400 resistance range is a high likelihood over the next few weeks. More importantly the major uptrend that we embarked upon in 2003 is still intact as well. On the flip side, 5,650-5,700 should be a region of strong long term support for the index,"" he added. 

 The ""Real"" or inflation adjusted Nifty suggests that the secular uptrend that started in 2003 is still intact for Indian equities, he says. 

 ""While downsides should be limited to the lower trendline (we are there already currently), a resolution of this pattern to the upside would imply massive upsides in the months ahead- this implies risk reward is favorable for buying Indian equities,"" he said. 

 At 12:40 p.m.; the S&P BSE Sensex was at 19,446.42, up 6.94 points or 0.04 per cent. The index has gained 10.23 per cent in one-year period.

After a gap of two years, jewellery exporters are witnessing orders coming from the US for jewellery and the units operating in Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) in Mumbai are flooded with enquiries. 

 The US jobs data for June has also sparked a fresh hope among jewellers. The US economy added a net 195,000 new jobs in June, official figures show. The figure is well above economists’ expectations of 165,000. 

 “Jewellers are expecting a 25%-30% growth in the US market in the current fiscal. The US is gradually coming out of recession and this is reflected in the enquiries that are coming from the country. We are seeing this sort of a demand after a gap of almost two years,” said Vipul Shah, chairman of Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council. 

 An increase in exports of gem and jewellery is a good news for the government which is trying hard to control the rising current account deficit (CAD) by curbing gold imports through a slew of measures. But for jewellery exporters, the government is ready to walk an extra mile. 

 Shah said Union commerce minister Anand Sharma has held a meeting with jewellery exporters and assured them of a steady supply of gold for exports. “He said that if any nominated agencies fail to supply gold, he would take action against them,” Shah said. 

 The jewellery units operating in SEEPZ are receiving a good flow of orders. Rajeev S Pandya, past president, SEEPZ Gems & Jewellery Manufacturers Association, said: “There has been an improvement in order position from June end. The industry had organised a jewellery show in Las Vegas in early June. The samples shown there have been well accepted by customers and they have started placing orders. 

 These are orders for the Christmas season. Some of the units in SEEPZ have their hands full while some have started receiving orders from the US. The US is compensating for the loss in Europe.” The Europe market is still reeling under a crisis and jewellers do not see an immediate recovery in that market. 

 “However, the West Asia and China markets are showing a good growth,” said Shah.

So, the market is getting a sense that this momentum and this sustained move is going to continue for the next couple of quarters. The price has moved up significantly.

Airbus sparks relief rally as Q1 profit beats forecasts,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/airbus-sparks-relief-rally-as-q1-profit-beats-forecasts/articleshow/35062066.cms,m.economictimes.com,Airbus sparks relief rally as Q1 profit beats forecasts,"PARIS: Airbus Group posted better than expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sparking a relief rally in its shares as it dodged the impact of higher costs for its new A350 jet, which remains on track for a late-2014 debut.


	Shares in the world's second-largest aerospace group after Boeing rose by around 5 per cent to 51.92 euros, their highest in more than a month, after it issued an upbeat report on A350 testing and exceeded profit forecasts by about 10 per cent.


	""This is a very good start to the year and guidance remains unchanged,"" Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note to investors. Airbus shares had fallen 11 percent since the start of the year, underperforming Boeing, which raked in more orders than its European arch-rival in the first quarter. The Franco-German company is among a number of European exporters facing concerns over recent gains in the euro.


	First-quarter operating income before one-off items fell by a smaller than expected 4.6 per cent to 700 million euros ($963 million) as revenue rose 5 per cent to 12.6 billion, and analysts said it had improved execution on key programmes.


	Analysts were on average expecting underlying quarterly operating income to fall 13 percent to 644 million euros on revenue of 12.4 billion, according to a poll. 

	Confirming recent comments by Europe's aviation regulator, Airbus Group said its latest jetliner, the A350, was ""progressing towards certification"" in the third quarter in time for first delivery by the end of the year to Qatar Airways.


	Completing Europe's answer to the lightweight carbon-composite Boeing 787 Dreamliner is seen as the biggest issue facing the Franco-German group as it tries to boost margins and avoid technical problems and delays experienced by its rival.


	 

	The head of the European Aviation Safety Agency said last week the A350's safety certification, the key milestone before any new aircraft's delivery, appeared to be on track for the end of the summer barring any new hiccups.


	Industry sources say it could come as soon as the end of August, but Airbus remains wary of problems that blighted previous civil and military programmes and has boosted support spending to ensure a smooth first delivery and ramp-up in production.


	""The A350 is in a critical phase, and challenges and risks remain,"" Finance Director Harald Wilhelm told reporters.


	IMPROVING A380


	Airbus struck an even more cautious note on its flagship jetliner, the double-decker A380 superjumbo, saying it was ""acting on the lessons"" gleaned from six years in service.


	It is taking advantage of the first heavy maintenance overhauls to incorporate improvements after recent glitches that include problems with door noise, Wilhelm said. A cargo door alert reportedly forced an A380 to turn around last week.


	Despite disappointing sales, Airbus still aims to break even on the jet in 2015 and expects to deliver 30 this year and next. Airbus also reaffirmed plans to cut 5,800 jobs as part of a restructuring of the company's defence and space division, where Wilhelm expected talks with unions to be completed in mid-year.


	Airbus said Turkey had taken its first delivery of the A400M military transporter after a stand-off that delayed delivery and distracted attention from its previous results. Airbus meanwhile reported another hefty outflow of cash in the first quarter as it earmarks liquidity for major projects.


	Free cashflow before acquisitions came in at a negative figure of 2 billion euros, but this was less than some analysts had feared and well below the 3.2 billion seen a year earlier.


	Airbus is aiming for stable free cashflow for the year. Revenue at Airbus Helicopters rose 14 per cent, and operating profit at the former Eurocopter unit almost trebled compared with the same quarter a year ago when flight restrictions in the wake of a series of incidents hit Super Puma deliveries.

  What is the call on the front line counters, Bajaj Auto came out with a very stellar quarter, do you think this momentum can sustain in the next few quarters as well?
   
  Even if it does, it is not really going to do much to its margin expansion. Today Bajaj is already facing the brunt of the higher input cost which we have been talking about since the last couple of quarters. So unless until commodity prices especially metal prices really see a little bit of easing off and it stays at where it is really not going to be easy for the likes of Bajaj which are into huge volumes to be able to benefit from that. 
  
  Given the fact that Hero Honda has become more attractive, we are expecting some shift in portfolios from Bajaj to Hero Honda which has been lying lower and has been shot down quite a bit thanks to all the news flow that we have seen there and that is one of the reasons where some reallocation could probably see money coming out of Bajaj and moving into Hero Honda. 
  
  Overall auto pack for different reason it is one of the most defensive states in terms of any sector if you look at and it is all consumption driven, it is all localised, it is going to do nothing to do too much with foreign exchanges. So it is a sector to be into even in these uncertain times.

The Pune-based Bajaj group flagship said net profit in the October-December period rose to Rs 475 crore, from Rs 164 crore last year. Its revenue in the same period surged 57% to Rs 3,295 crore.The quarter saw an increase in cost of raw material, mainly steel and in the price of components. “However, due to higher volumes and by leveraging fixed cost and cost management, we were able to achieve operating margin at 22% during the third quarter, against 14.5% last year,” said finance vice-president Kevin D’sa.Bajaj Auto, which competes strongly with market leader Hero Honda in the high margin two-wheeler market, sold 809,218 units in the third quarter, a 64% jump over the previous year. The robust sales reflected a turnaround in the economic situation, which had been hit adversely in 2008, as tight liquidity and slow demand dented auto sales.Analysts said this has been Bajaj Auto’s best quarter, surpassing even the second quarter. The strategy to focus on ‘bigger and sportier’ motorcycles helped the company grow its market share, they said. “The results weren’t surprising and reflects the underlining efforts of the company in regaining lost market share,” said Mahantesh Sabarad, an analyst at Centrum Broking.Apart from increased market share, Bajaj Auto has been able to boost its cash flow. Mr D’sa said it has surplus cash and cash equivalents of Rs 2,625 crore, against Rs 933 crore as on March last year. Shares of Bajaj Auto ended 1.7%, up at Rs 1,698.10 on BSE on Tuesday. After countering the slow demand scenario last year, Indian two-wheeler makers have focused on the growing rural market through bigger products, which has helped in increasing volumes and margins.A Bajaj Auto executive said while the shift away from 100cc economy motorcycles initially did put pressure on sales, it has paid in terms of market share and profitability. Industry sales in the motorcycle segment rose by 37%, while Bajaj Auto sales rose 72% at 7.11 lakh units. The newly-launched Pulsar 135 LS is expected to add to the company’s market share in motorcycles and enable the Pulsar brand reach one million-a-year in sales.

 The key highlight of BHEL’s provisional, or flash, results for the financial year was the stupendous growth in order inflows. At Rs 31,528 crore, BHEL reported a 43% rise in new orders compared with Rs 22,096 crore in FY12 when the base was very low. But it is still far off from the Rs 60,500 crore in new orders the company had reported in FY11. 

 In fact, at Rs 1.15 lakh crore, BHEL’s order book at the end of FY13 is only a notch higher than its order backlog of Rs 1,13,700 crore at the end of December 2012. This order book is, however, the lowest for the company in four years. The management expects order inflows to improve significantly in FY14. Institutional investors’ expectations from BHEL continue to be mixed. 

 Local fund managers, who have reservations about earnings visibility and order inflows, have further reduced their shareholding in the company to 1% at the end of FY13 from 1.44% at the beginning of the year, while foreign institutional investors, or FIIs, increased their shareholding to 14.75% from 13.49% a year ago. This is by far the lowest holding by mutual funds in the company in at least 12 years or since March 2001. 

 The cautious approach of these investors is on account of execution difficulties the company is facing and may continue to face even in the near term due to slowing economic growth. Even though the company expects to see its turnover top Rs 50,000 crore for the very first time (going by the provisional numbers), the fact is this is a mere 1% growth in turnover from a year ago. 

 Similarly, at Rs 6,485 crore, BHEL’s provisional net profit is 8% lower than the previous year. The management maintains that there is no significant negative impact on operating margins, citing improvements in localisation processes and cost efficiencies. The company is also increasingly focusing on developing indigenous research and development, or R&D, to help reduce costs in the coming months. 

 According to Amit Patil, Research Analyst, Angel Broking, slow execution on account of client deferrals due to slowdown in investment cycle and various problems in the power sector continue to remain an overhang on the stock. Given this backdrop, it is tough to make a call on whether the stock price of BHEL will continue to gain momentum.
 
 KEY POINTS 

 At Rs 31,528 cr, BHEL reported a 43% rise in new orders compared with Rs 22,096 cr in FY12. But it is still way below the Rs 60,500 cr in new orders the co reported in FY11. At Rs 6,485 cr, BHEL’s provisional net profit is 8% lower than the previous year.

Birla Power Solutions to raise $100 million; stock up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/birla-power-solutions-to-raise-100-million-stock-up/articleshow/8149633.cms,m.economictimes.com,Birla Power Solutions to raise $100 million; stock up,"
  MUMBAI: Portable generator-maker Birla Power Solutions is looking at raising up to $100 million in the current financial year from private equity players to part finance its diversification plans, the company's managing director told ET. The Yash Birla-led company has planned an investment of 10,000 crore over the next five years to foray into thermal and solar power. 
  
  At 9:50 am, shares of Birla Power Solutions were trading 2.70% up at Rs 1.14 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  For this, Birla Power Solutions may sell up to 15% stake in itself or up to 26% in its subsidiary, Birla Urja, to a private equity player, PVR Murthy said. 
  
  ""We are talking to 3-4 global private equity investors. Traditionally, we have not had institutional investors but if we are growing big, we need to have them,"" Murthy said. The company could induct a representative of the PE fund on the board of the company. 
  
  ""We would rope in their professional practices. We have no issue if they come in at parent company level or at subsidiary level,"" Murthy said. 
  
  The company has a market capitalisation of 239 crore. For expansion into the power sector, Birla Power Solutions will need an equity investment of 2,000 crore, while the balance 8,000 crore would be funded through debt. 
  
  Birla Power will also undertake a global depository receipt issue and promoters will infuse funds via warrant conversion to boost the company's equity base. Promoters currently hold 4.04% in the company. They also hold warrants, which on conversion would raise the holding to around 13%, Murthy said.

  In an interview with 
  ET Now
  , 
  Sharmila Joshi
  , Co-Head PCG Sales, Emkay Global Financial Services, talks about Blue Star and Voltas. Excerpts:
  
  
  What are your two picks?
  
  Both are interrelated in a way. I am talking of Blue Star and Voltas. So there is a commonality in the sense of the kind of business that they do. If you look at the quarter 4 numbers for both the companies, they have been really way ahead of our expectations and as a result of which, we find that whatever we had been talking of earlier that going forward it will be the MEP, mechanical, electrical and plumbing which is going to be driving the business for both these companies. That seems to be playing out. So essentially, to just focus on Blue Star, we see that every segment that they are into, they have done well. They will continue to do better in all of them. Room air conditioners will be a focus again because you will see 25% plus growth there and the under penetration in the other businesses as well will mean very good order inflows for both the MEP division as well. So going forward, margins will improve from the kind of levels that they are at currently. So Blue Star is a stock that we like and we have a target of 464 for Blue Star. 
  
  
  What about Voltas? 
  
  Numbers have been even better. If you look at the quarter 4 FY10 performance, it has really been way ahead of our estimate. The interesting thing for Voltas also is the fact that their FY11, whatever order book that we have estimated is already with them. So there will be a further uptick if anything in the stock if they get better orders from hereon. So for both is going to be the progression from the HVAC play to MEP as well as the fact that there is an under penetration in all the markets that they are in and the fact that room air conditioners will continue to grow at 25% plus. So Voltas post numbers has already given you a good run up from the kind of 184-185 levels that it was at but this is a stock that we continue to like with a target of about 234. 
  
  
  So both are really a play on a growing middle class in the country, right? 
  
  Absolutely and in the capital goods space, it is either the consumption story or the fact that you will increasingly see focus on industrial capex. Those are the type of ideas that we like, for instance McNally Bharat would be another stock where the focus is clearly on industrial capex. Petron Engineering would be another interesting stock to look at in the current environment. So yes, those are the kind of stories that the market likes, one which are directly linked to domestic consumption and other story in the capital goods space of industrial capex.

Calculus: Jet Airways international operations to ensure stable revenues,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/calculus-jet-airways-international-operations-to-ensure-stable-revenues/articleshow/30151927.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Calculus: Jet Airways international operations to ensure stable revenues,"Though Jet Airways’ losses widened to Rs 267 crore in the December 2013 quarter against a profit of Rs 85 crore a year ago, its growing focus on international operations could be earnings-per-share accretive for investors in the long term. 

 Over the last two years, the contribution of Jet Airways India’s international operations to its overall revenues has increased from about 55% to 58%, helped by the Jet-Etihad deal, superior operational performance overseas and higher yield. The sale of 24% stake to the Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways offers Jet Airways not only access to the Middle East but also to Europe and North America. 

 Its international operations have been better than domestic services, which have been hit by high fuels costs, competition and price-sensitive travellers. Thanks to its performance overseas, the airline’s yield or revenue passenger per kilometre is on the rise. For Jet Airways, the breakeven seat factor for its international operations is 86.1%; it is 80% for domestic operations. 

 Besides, the average gross revenue per passenger for its international operations is Rs 14,406, while it is Rs 5,825 for its domestic operations. The company’s cost per available kilometre for its international operations is Rs 3.3, compared to Rs 5.6 for local operations. Unlike the domestic market, which is price-sensitive , estimates show 60% of outbound travellers are not impacted by higher ticket prices considering they are on business and corporate travel. 

 That means the airline’s focus on international operations will ensure reasonably stable revenues. This strategy has also pushed its yield, which rose to . 4.89 from Rs 3.9 in the December 2011 quarter. 

 Etihad Airways will play a critical role in boosting the contribution of international operations to Jet’s total revenues. The Rs 3,000 crore Jet received from Etihad for a 24% stake helped it cut debt to Rs 10,895 crore in December 2013 from Rs 12,495 crore in the September 2013 quarter. 

 On valuation, Jet is a contrarian investment , and given its size of operations, the stock should see a re-rating in two years. Jet is trading at a one-year forward EV/ sales of 0.79, which, according to Bloomberg’s analysts’ poll, is expected to come down further to 0.69 in FY15.
 
 In the quarter to December 2013, the company’s net revenues grew by 7.3% to Rs 4,229 crore on a year-on-year basis. An increase in employee costs and fuel expenses in the December quarter eroded the company’s revenues. 

 Shares of Jet Airways lost 2.54% to close at . 228.5 on the BSE on Friday.

 ""Profit after tax was up by 46 per cent at Rs 146.7 crore during the quarter under review compared with the same period last year. Other income was higher on account of writeback of provisions,"" it said. 

 Ravi Kirpalani, MD, Castrol India, said: ""This is indeed a strong overall performance and the momentum gained during the first quarter of 2015 sets up the business well for the rest of the year."" 

 Although the environment continues to be challenging for commercial trucks, business-to-business (B2B) and marine businesses, the performance continues to be driven by the personal mobility segment where underlying volumes and margins have grown over the previous year, he said. 

 ""Looking ahead, although the drop in crude oil price will translate into lower base oil cost, we are likely to experience volatility in the cost of goods due to a volatile rupee exchange rate. We expect demand to start improving during the second half of the year,"" the statement read. 

 Castrol said it remains optimistic about the Indian lubricant market in the long run.

 According to sources, the stock movement of companies related to Gujarat and many others are being closely watched as they have witnessed huge rallies in recent weeks.

In general, markets slide when the home currency depreciates.
 
 However, markets coming out of a currency bottom outperform the broader regional index over the following 3 to 6 months. For instance, after falling 20% in the four months from May to September 2013, the Indian rupee gained about 10% in the following six months. Sensex followed the rupee in tandem, falling some 6% as the rupee fell, and rising 15% as the rupee rose.
 
 Over the last many years, Sensex and the rupee (against the US dollar) have risen or fallen noticeably closely. Now, as the rupee depreciation slows, equity performance is likely to improve, analysts predict.
 
 “We believe that the USD rally is nearing its end. As the currency depreciation slows, equities can perform well,” says Devendra Joshi, strategist, Asia Pacifi c, HSBC. “Defensive sectors, like consumer staples, tend to outperform going into currency weakness. Consumer discretionary, banks and materials tend to lead coming out of it.”

FIIs returning to Bond Street as yields turn attractive,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/fiis-returning-to-bond-street-as-yields-turn-attractive/articleshow/21255976.cms,m.economictimes.com,FIIs returning to Bond Street as yields turn attractive,"MUMBAI: International investors showed signs of returning to buy Indian government bonds at the latest permits auction by Sebi, but paid low premium that indicated their interest may be conditional on higher yields in the next few weeks.
 
 Bids from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) fully covered the available permits as they sought to buy 26,000 crore worth of bonds while Sebi had put on sale permits amounting to 23,500 crore. These permits are valid for 90 days before which the investor has to buy the bonds.
 
 The latest round of bids will be encouraging for the government as it indicates a reversal in thinking by FIIs, which have pulled out 51,214 crore from Indian debt since May 22 amid rising attractiveness of US bonds and the fear that the Indian rupee may slide to new lows eroding their capital.
 
 ""They (FIIs) believe the currency will stabilise and yields at current level are a very attractive level to get in,"" said NS Venkatesh, head of treasury at IDBI Bank. ""They expect short-term rates to come off in a month or so and that is when they expect to make money when bond prices rise.""
 
 Indian bonds have turned unattractive after yields fell to a low of 7.1% on May 15 when the central bank reduced the repo rate.
 
 
Positive Response
 
 
  Repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends to banks. But US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's May 22 signal that he might taper the $85-billion monthly bond purchases - the fountain of liquidity to the emerging world - pushed up US bond yields by 100 basis points in a few weeks.
 
 The benchmark 10-year government bonds ended 15 basis points higher at 8.08% on Monday. The yields on US 10-year bonds were at 2.49%. Although numerically Indian yields are attractive, adjusting for the cost of hedging the currency, a foreign investor may still be losing 30-40 basis points in Indian government bonds.
 
 The latest round of FII response is slightly different to the previous round in June where the bids fell short of what was on offer.
 
 Fears that the central bank may reverse its interest rate stance and raise the repo rate to defend the currency is also making investors cautious. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao may raise interest rates if the currency touches 62 to the US dollar, reported Reuters citing unnamed officials in the government. The rupee fell to 59.72 to the dollar.
 
 The rupee has lost 10% since April when fears about India's current account deficit and the US turning off the liquidity tap spread. Even RBI's efforts to limit the fall had not paid off as the country's trade position also remains weak with merchandise exports falling 4.5% in June and imports rising 0.73%. RBI also banned banks from doing any proprietary trading in the currency, leading to a fall in volumes.
 
 In a roundabout way, RBI raised interest rates in the system. Last Monday, it capped the banks' borrowing through its liquidity window at 75,000 crore and lifted penal borrowing by 200 basis points to 10.25%. This led to chaos in the bond markets with yields surging as much as 63 basis points in a single day.

The company provides engineering consultancy and EPC services, and is principally focused on the oil & gas and petrochemical industries.
 
 Shares of EIL have been under some pressure since 2013, down nearly 40 per cent. While for the year 2014 so far, the stock has plunged a little over 10 per cent, thus making valuation a little more compelling.
 
 The government is now putting on the block 10 per cent of its holding to raise funds before the close of this fiscal year, to boost non-tax receipts and keep fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP.
 
 The government has set a price range of Rs 145-150 a share for the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Engineers India Ltd (EIL) starting on Thursday, aimed at garnering about Rs 500 crore.
 
 EIL said a discount of Rs 6 a share will be offered to retail investors and employees. The government plans to reserve 5 per cent of the offer for employees.
 
 Shares of EIL closed at Rs 151.35 up 1.61 per cent. It hit a low of Rs 148 and a high of Rs 153.45 in trade today.
 
 
Angel Broking highlights five reasons why investors should subscribe to share sale:
 
 
Leadership position in project implementation
 
 EIL has developed indigenous technology and expertise for offshore platforms, oil & gas processing, oil refining, petrochemicals and pipeline projects over the last 48 years enabling it to provide a gamut of management services from project conception to commissioning in hydrocarbon business. EIL’s leadership in project implementation and long-term relationships with its clients gives it a competitive advantage over its peers.
 
 
Diversified operations across sectors and geographies
 
 Over the years, the company has diversified across various segments such as LNG, fertilizer, power, mining and metallurgy and infrastructure to encash the untapped infra opportunity not only in Indian but globally (presence in Middle East, Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia) as well and has an excellent track record of achieving the same. This will help the company to benefit from any recovery in the capex cycle both domestically and internationally.
 
 
Healthy order inflows over past couple of quarters
 
 The company has secured orders worth Rs 1,800 crore (up 39.5 % YoY) in 9MFY2014, taking the order backlog to Rs 3,820 crore, implying an order backlog to sales ratio of 2.1x on a trailing basis. This includes a major order worth $139 million bagged from Dangote Group in Nigeria for project management consultancy and EPC management.
 
 
Valuations
 
 At the lower and upper limit of the price-band of Rs 145 and Rs 150, the stock is currently trading at valuations of 8.4x and 8.7x FY2015E Bloomberg EPS respectively which is lower than its 3-year average PE of 14.8x.
 
 
Outlook
 
 Although the company has reported weak revenues in MFY2014, the improvement in order inflows indicates recovery in revenue going forward. Considering EIL’s dominance in the hydrocarbon business and attractive valuations, we recommend Subscribe on the stock.

"Hexaware Technologies rides high with big orders, focussed strategy",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hexaware-technologies-rides-high-with-big-orders-focussed-strategy/articleshow/11272560.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Hexaware Technologies rides high with big orders, focussed strategy","
  Stock of the Mumbai-based IT, BPO and consulting services provider Hexaware Technologies has jumped over 44% in the past one year against a 16% drop in the ET Infotech index. The company's strong performance over the past several quarters and large order wins recently offer a healthy growth visibility for the mid-cap IT company. 
  
  Unlike some of the similar-sized industry rivals, Hexaware has been able to post a strong growth in its top line as well as bottom line over the past several quarters positioning itself amongst the most preferred IT mid-cap among the investors. Also, the company has been able to post a healthy recovery in its operating profit margin. 
  
  During the September 2011 quarter, Hexaware posted a nearly 10% revenue growth to 366 crore against the previous quarter, led by a robust volume growth of 9.2%. Operating profit margin has improved from single digit levels in the September 2010 quarter to 18.5% currently, 350 basis points up sequentially. Net profit has surged over 7% sequentially to 65 crore. 
  
  Hexaware has won six large deals in the past 18 months. While all the deals are in excess of $25 million, three are over $100 million. Cumulatively, these deals are worth over $600 million. This also includes $250-milion deal signed last month with the company's existing UK-based client, which is expected to add $60 million incremental sales over a period of five years starting from January 2012 onwards. 
  
  With net headcount addition of 745 during the September 2011 quarter, the company has exceeded its annual hiring target of 1,500 by 10% already. Moreover, operating at low attrition rate of 14.7% and with plans to hire 200 more people by the end of the current quarter, Hexaware reflects a strong deal pipeline going ahead. 
  
  With consistent growth momentum over the past several quarters, the company has revised the annual revenue guidance to 32% at $306 million. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Hexaware's focussed strategy has helped the company in stronger client mining and expanding footprints to newer geographies, including America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. 
  
  Also, increased spending in the enterprise services and banking, financial services and insurance verticals globally is likely to benefit the company going ahead. 
  
  While recent large deal wins will offer the momentum for revenue 
  
  growth, rupee depreciation in the past few months, offshore revenue shift, improved employee pyramid and better cost efficiencies are likely to be the key margin levers going ahead. 
  
  At the current market price of 76.3, the stock trades at 10.3 times its earnings for the trailing 12 months.

 Chances are that these upside breakout can take it to at least 131. Once 131 is crossed, 133 could easily be seen and any stop loss here should be placed below 128.

  You like IDFC, what is the price target and what is the rationale behind the stock?
   
  IDFC is the foremost player in the infrastructure finance segment and we all are seeing a lot of seriousness by the government on infrastructure spending. Also with their recent infrastructure NBFC status, the company is now able to raise loans at much lower rates compared to before. So cost of funding has come down and given its size, we believe that it is in a position to grow loan book very substantially. This would itself rate the company to a target of around 300 or so in a year’s time. We also believe that there is a bonus upside in the form that they do hold equity in a lot of infrastructure projects within the country which they have financed over the last few years. As and when these come and they get returns on these, these would be bonus upsides on the counter.

"IFC doubles rupee bond offering to Rs 2,000 crore",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/ifc-doubles-rupee-bond-offering-to-rs-2000-crore/articleshow/28843829.cms,m.economictimes.com,"IFC doubles rupee bond offering to Rs 2,000 crore","NEW DELHI: International Finance Corp (IFC) has doubled its rupee bond offering in global markets, to Rs 2,000 crore, citing strong investor interest from developed economies, the private investment arm of the World Bank announced on Wednesday. 

 The first global rupee bond was issued in November last year, and is part of IFC's $1 billion(Rs 6,165 crore) global rupee bond program. 

 The transaction was upsized from Rs 300 crore in response to strong investor demand, according to a press statement released by the World Bank arm. Investors included asset managers, private banks, insurance companies, and central banks, in Asia, Europe and the U.S, the press release said. 

 According to data released by IFC, US-based investors have snapped up about 60% of the issue, followed by European and Asian investors, who have picked up 26% and 14% of the offering, respectively. Asset managers have been, by far, the largest investors to invest in the issue. 

 "" The strong market reception for the second IFC global rupee bond signals continued investor interest to rupee exposure,"" said Monish Mahurkar, director, IFC for Treasury Client Solutions. 

 Mahurkar also said that attracting foreign investment was key as the organisation continued to work with authorities to develop the rupee capital markets and provide an alternative source of rupee financing to stimulate foreign investment in India. 

 Priced on January 13 earlier this year, the bonds carry a coupon of 7.75%, with a maturity date of December 3. 2016. They will be listed either on the Singapore or Luxembourg exchanges, and are priced at about $161 million (Rs 992.7 crore), as per the latest currency exchange rates. 

 IFC global rupee bonds are denominated in Indian rupee but settled in U.S. dollars, with all principal and coupon payments tied to the U.S. dollar-rupee exchange rate. IFC converts bond proceeds from dollars into rupees on the domestic spot exchange market, and uses the rupees to invest in the country. 

 Over the years, IFC has issued bonds in 14 local currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi, the Nigeria naira, and the Russian ruble 

 India accounted for $4.5 billion (Rs 27,744.8 crore) of IFC's committed investment portfolio as of June 30, 2013-more than any other country. In the fiscal ended 2013 , IFC invested $1.38 billion (Rs 8.508.4 crore) in the country, to achieve several strategic priorities such as promoting inclusive growth in the country's low-income states, focusing on climate change, and supporting global economic integration. 

 JP Morgan and TD Securities acted as lead managers for the transaction.

Indian cashew exports to touch new high this fiscal,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/indian-cashew-exports-to-touch-new-high-this-fiscal/articleshow/32634009.cms,m.economictimes.com,Indian cashew exports to touch new high this fiscal,"KOCHI: Indian cashew exports have reached a new high of Rs4,624 crore, surpassing last year’s figure, with one more month to go in the fiscal 2014. 

 The possibility of exports touching Rs5,000 crore is not ruled out as the exporters could send more shipments in the last month. In 2012-13, cashew exports stood at Rs4,420 crore, which was the highest till now. The fall in rupee value during the year has helped in raising the total value of cashew exports. 

 Though the volumes have been down in certain months, the value has remained high. For instance in February 2014, the quantity of cashew export is lower by 12per cent at 7,009 tonne. However, the value is up by 6 per cent at Rs315 crore. 

 The total quantity, too, has almost reached the level in 2012-13 at 1,09,958 tonne at the end of February 2014. In the previous year the total quantity exported touched 1,10,306 tonne. 

 Higher exports have been achieved despite a 14per cent drop in raw cashew imports at 7,32,478 tonne till the end of February 2014. “Rising prices of raw cashew imported from Tanzania in the last few months have led to slowdown in processing, squeezing the export volumes. As a result many processing factories in Kerala have stopped working,’’ said P Somarajan, proprietor of Kailas Cashew Exports. The raw cashew price has eased after touching a high of over $1,400 per tonne. 

 The raw cashew from east African countries has been traditionally dearer than those from the west African regions, where the harvest has begun. “But this time the prices have been high at the start of the season at $1,150 per tonne. It has declined by $100 now, but is still high,’’ he added. India imports 8 to 9 lakh tonne of raw cashew every year. 

 While the raw nut price remains high, the cashew kernel price has been hovering in the range of $3.15 to 3.20 per pound, a factor which has been worrying the exporters. 

 “At the price we have been buying raw cashew, we should be getting a minimum of $3.40 per pound. But Indian exporters have been compelled to export at the above price, the rate at which Vietnam, the major supplier in the global market now, sells,’’ said Babu Oommen, proprietor of Alphonsa Cashew Industries. Some processors, who had stock of raw cashew nuts from the previous year with them made a killing by selling to other processors. Better domestic production at over 7 lakh tonne helped the exporters to tide over the lower imports to a certain extent.

Prakash Diwan: It is disappointing to see that very few people have been able to part take in the great story. Info Edge has such a decent portfolio, with almost all category leaders — be it matrimony or the job portal side.
 
 
ET Now: They have real estate portal called 99acres as well.
 
 
Prakash Diwan: Real estate portfolio of the company took off way before others. The company has been able to match peers with very successful cost effective ad campaigns. So, the recall value has been tremendous, which is very important in e-commerce start ups. They are the only mature businesses in the portfolio.
 
 But, if you actually ask me, even today if somebody wants to buy these stocks, you are not buying something, which is a binary kind of investment, the one that would make either great money or actually make you lose money.
 
 Info Edge is still a great investment. As a disclaimer, I must say that we have this company as our client portfolio since fairly long time now. We believe that it continues to add value. With every news this the business is getting monetised.
 
 So, there is tremendous value and you can look at the kind of funding that could come in some of these businesses for the next five, six-seven years. It is not just like a one off thing like Zomato. You will have so much more to go for this.

  Do you expect investment is likely to come into the sugar counters?
   
  
  Avinash Gorakshekar: Yeah, at least in the shorter term, the flavour seems to have come back because there is going to be a supply constraint considering the Australia kind of issue but at least from a medium to longer term sense, it is very clear that we would like to know globally how the demand and supply scenario pans out because if India does not allow export of sugar, obviously most of the sugar players are waiting for the policy guidelines from the government. 
  
  The immediate reaction to yesterday’s global news has been quite positive and at least in the near term, we expect that even domestic prices of sugar would possibly firm up but to really put it in perspective whether these companies would actually make a decent mark up in their operating margins and how sustainable this price rise would be, it would be better to wait and watch at least for a quarter and then go ahead because this movement seems to be clearly market driven and most of the players have been quite apprehensive that this kind of global price rise as well as global development, the kind of benefit flow to Indian companies has not actually been pinpointed that clearly.
  
  
  From these levels if there is some positive that come out, can the fertiliser stocks go further from these levels?
   
  
  Avinash Gorakshekar: Typically at least agro stocks are definitely in limelight and if a policy directive comes out more favourably, especially for nutrient fertilisers and typically stocks, which are in the flavour like a Coromandel Fertiliser or may be a Chambal, I would suggest that probably these stocks would definitely get into the limelight because all said and done, we are expecting probably a good crop. 
  
  Incidentally just before the budget, the government would also like to ensure that some sort of subsidy kind of arrangement is also given out, so to that extent the outlook could turn positive because the industry has been awaiting this policy change for a long time, so last time the meeting was organised and nothing came out, so hopefully this time something concrete should come out to actually make the stocks actually move up.

Investor sentiment will turn in favour of Rupee: Chidambaram,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/investor-sentiment-will-turn-in-favour-of-rupee-chidambaram/articleshow/20860295.cms,m.economictimes.com,Investor sentiment will turn in favour of Rupee: Chidambaram,"NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over declining rupee, Finance Minister P Chidambaram today said the currency will find its level as steps being taken by the government to contain fiscal and current account deficits will improve investor sentiments. 

 ""We are committed to contain the fiscal deficit within the target and we are addressing how to finance the current account deficit. Sentiment will turn in favour of the rupee. I think rupee will find its level,"" he said in an interview with PTI here. 

 The rupee had touched historic low of 60.76 level against the dollar on June 26 due to heavy capital outflows amid fears of early withdrawal of US monetary stimulus. 

 Both the government and RBI have taken steps to contain gold imports, which is putting pressure on the CAD. Measures have been taken to enhance FII inflows in addition to easing norms for domestic companies to raise fund from abroad. 

 The Finance Minister, however added there is 'no good and bad value' that one could attach to the price of the rupee. 

 ""It's a price. Rupee is bought and sold. Dollars are bought and sold there is a price. It's also a function of supply and demand. It's also influenced by sentiment,"" he said. 

 Unfortunately, Chidambaram said, it is not only the sentiment of Indian buyers and sellers that matters in the forex market. 

 ""Even the sentiment of a lone gentleman (US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke) in the US impacts the rupee. And I have said Mr Bernanke statement is misunderstood or misinterpreted,"" he said. 

 Chidambaram said even in the US there are different views on the appropriateness of the Fed statement, it's timing and its content. 

 ""But I think once the true import of that statement sunk in... the rupee has recovered in the last few days. Even today rupee has recovered a bit,"" he added. 

 The rupee today rose by 10 paise to 59.29 against the dollar in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market on increased selling of the US currency by exporters. 

 Chidambaram also pointed out that high CAD, fiscal deficit and inflation have a depreciating impact on the rupee. 

 The Finance Minister said that all emerging economies -- including Mexico, Chile, South Africa and Turkey -- are running huge current account deficits. 

 India's CAD touched a record high of 4.8 per cent of the GDP in the 2012-13 financial year due to high imports, including that of gold. High CAD puts pressure on the value of the rupee.

Its time to take banking sector funds into account,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/its-time-to-take-banking-sector-funds-into-account/articleshow/35012026.cms,m.economictimes.com,It’s time to take banking sector funds into account,"
	Bank Nifty scaled a new peak on Friday. After underperforming the broad market for almost a year, banking sector funds have outperformed in the past three months after investors started betting on cyclical stocks. According to Value Research, a mutual fund tracking entity, banking sector funds as a category delivered 31.18% against 13.12 per cent given by CNX Nifty, in three months ended on May 9. 


	Suddenly, many stock market pundits are bullish on the sector in the medium- to longterm , as they feel the fundamentals will improve in the coming months. ""Indian economy is on the path of recovery and banking is best positioned to benefit in the process. Most banks reported better than estimated numbers for the last quarter, and the numbers on non performing assets was better than analyst estimates,"" says Jitendra Panda, MD & CEO, Peerless Securities. 


	He advises investors to put their money in actively-managed banking sector funds in a staggered manner. There are 13 mutual fund schemes dedicated to investing in banking stocks. These funds together manage around Rs 2,423 crore as on March 31. 


	""Banking sector has short-term issues such as non performing assets, but as the economy picks up, the sector is bound to do well,"" says Sunil Singhania, CIO-equity investments, Reliance Capital Asset Management. 


	However, advisors are asking investors to be measured in their approach. ""Diversified funds have 20-25 per cent of their investments in banking and financial sector stocks. So, an investor with exposure to diversified equity funds should restrict his investments in banking sector funds to the extent of 10 per cent of his entire equity portfolio,"" says Feroze Azeez, director — private wealth management, Anand Rathi Financial Services. 


	He recommends investing in Reliance Banking Fund through a systematic investment plan (SIP). However, identifying the right scheme to invest could prove a bit tricky for average investors. Though these schemes appear the same at first glance, they have varying investment mandates and it can make a big difference to their fortunes, say experts. For example, banking funds as acategory registered 4.43 per cent returns in the three years. 


	The best performing banking fund offered 12.62 per cent, while the worst performing banking fund lost 7.42 per cent. The large variance in returns is partly due to difference in their investment mandate. Passively-managed Kotak PSU bank ETF and Goldman Sachs PSU Bank BeES Fund lost money, as their investment mandate makes the fund manager mimic the PSU Banking index, which has been falling in last three years in a slowing economy. 

	

	In comparison, activelymanaged funds fared far better. PSU Index ETF from Kotak and Goldman Sachs lost 7.42 per cent and 7.05 per cent, actively ICICI Prudential Banking & Financial Services Fund gained 12.62% in three years. ""Actively-managed banking funds were invested in PSU banks two years ago, but they were quick to move to private sector banks, thus managing the risk well and generating outperformance for the investors,"" says Azeez. 


	 

	He prefers activelymanaged funds as they can align their portfolios with changing dynamics of the sector to generate outperformance to the benchmark. Banking sector has three components — public sector banks, private sector banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Mutual fund schemes have products that invest in one or all of these components. 


	For example , Goldman Sachs AMC has two different schemes that track CNX Bank Index and CNX PSU Bank Index. Reliance Mutual Fund also has two schemes — Reliance Banking Fund, which is an actively-managed banking sector fund and R*Shares Banking Exchange Traded Fund, which is an index fund that tracks CNX Bank Index. ""Investors keen on sector exposure without fund manger risk should invest in passively managed index funds, however those seeking outperformance should invest in actively-managed funds,” says Singhania.

Jet Airways top pick in aviation stocks: Pankaj Pandey,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/jet-airways-top-pick-in-aviation-stocks-pankaj-pandey/articleshow/50349794.cms,m.economictimes.com,Jet Airways top pick in aviation stocks: Pankaj Pandey," 	In an interaction with ET Now, Pankaj Pandey, HoR, ICICIdirect.com, said Jet Airways is still at a substantial discount compared to the market leader. Excerpts:  	ET Now: Within aviation, there has been a lot of talk about SpiceJet and IndiGo, but you are putting your bet on Jet Airways which has had a decent run given the performance and the reality with crude oil prices. Why is that your top pick within aviation?  	Pankaj Pandey: On Jet Airways, we have a target price of Rs 790. What we would want to believe is that the kind of margin expansion that happened in FY11 to the tune of about 11 odd per cent, that is very much possible in a scenario like this where crude, aviation turbine fuel has corrected by 43 per cent. In addition, if you look at the industry still not competing on prices, which is a very positive and encouraging trend from overall perspective, we believe that the margin expansion will be more than what we had earlier anticipated. Crude is still expected to stay low, which is where the trigger would come from. In addition to that, growth in passenger traffic has been quite good at about 19 per cent, which augurs well from an earnings perspective. This stock is still at a substantial discount compared to the market leader. So from that perspective, we believe that this stock has a lot more to catch up and that's why it is one of our top picks.

In June 2012 quarter, the company reported a robust 38% y-o-y growth in net profits. 

 In the quarter ending June 2012, JK Cement's revenues grew by 21% y-o-y to Rs 736 crore. This was mainly due to 15% growth in dispatch volumes and 5% increase in realization per ton. 

 However, on a sequential basis, dispatch volumes were lower by 11% in comparison to March 2012 quarter. The company was able to achieve higher volumes on y-o-y basis due to a weak monsoon that led to an increase in construction activity. 

 However, it would be difficult for the company to maintain the 7% growth in volumes in the coming quarters. For a pick up in demand, a lot would depend on the revival of infrastructure and real estate structure. One of the key triggers for the revival would be the softening of interest rates. 

 At current market price of Rs 232, the stock is trading at an Enterprise Value (EV) per ton of $65. This is in line with its similar sized peers, which are trading at an EV/ton of nearly $60.

KV Kamath to map Infosys succession plan; stock rises,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/tech/software/kv-kamath-to-map-infosys-succession-plan-to-groom-managers-for-key-positions/articleshow/8138617.cms,m.economictimes.com,"KV Kamath to map Infosys succession plan, to groom managers for key positions","
  BANGALORE: Infosys, which on Saturday appointed KV Kamath as chairman in place of its iconic founder NR Narayana Murthy, will now draw up a succession plan for the eventual exit of all founders and the appointment of young professionals to run the company. 
  
  Kamath, whose tenure at ICICI Bank coincided with the appointment of many women professionals to important positions and who oversaw a similar succession at the bank during a troubled time in 2009, will help prepare such a plan, a person close to the development said. He will oversee the process of identifying and grooming people to fill important roles either at the board level or at the level of the management council, the software services firm’s next big decision-making body. 
  
  ET was the first to report that Kamath was the front-runner for Infosys chairman’s post in its edition dated August 16, 2010. 
  
  These managers could be given major responsibilities such as leading the company as the chief executive, becoming the COO or being appointed to similar senior roles at the board level, the person added. All this is expected to happen in the next five years and before the eventual retirement of Kamath from the company and that of the two founders — SD Shibulal and Kris Gopalakrishnan — from their executive roles. 
  
  “Forget charisma and clout, Infosys’ biggest transition is when founders are gone, and that’s why the company has picked Kamath, who has proven succession planning skills,” said another person familiar with the process behind this appointment. 
  
  Infosys has been dogged by controversy over succession as time neared for Murthy’s retirement from the company. He started the company in 1981 with money borrowed from his wife and is stepping down from all positions this year. So far, the company has followed the practice of allowing each of its major founder shareholders to take up the chief executive’s position.

  But this has had its share of problems. A senior Infosys director and a long-time Murthy confidante, TV Mohandas Pai, quit in a huff last month, saying the company should reward merit over seniority. 
  
  
  Murmurs of dissent at the Top management
  
  There were murmurs of dissent among the senior management cadre over being ignored for bigger roles. On Saturday, in a partial acknowledgement that the problem was serious, Infosys said it will consider appointing some senior managers to the board before the next shareholders meet in June. 
  
  ""Murthy is no mean planner - he was thinking at least five to seven years ahead when all founders would be gone and the board too will need new faces,"" said a person familiar with the decision-making at Infosys. ""Kamath has been brought in to create a structure that gives Infosys a self-perpetuating board and management, the way Tatas are running their companies,"" he added, requesting anonymity. 
  
  Kamath's skills at pushing growth and getting his managers to capture market share are well known and ICICI Bank grew to become one of India's biggest banks during his tenure. But in Infosys, Kamath faces a different set of challenges. The old guard is exiting and a new set of leaders has to be found and groomed for bigger responsibilities. The transition also has to be done without causing resentment among employees and management and uncertainty among shareholders. 
  
  
 
  In an exclusive chat with ET, Murthy also praised his skills in delegating responsibilities. Kamath has experience in managing succession. In 2009, just before he joined the Infosys board, Kamath helped ICICI Bank manage a successful leadership transition, passing on the baton to Chanda Kochhar. 
  
  ""Nobody has managed the transition from CEO to chairman as well as KVK has. He has made sure that Chanda was in the front seat. Was there to provide all advice, nicely, in a dignified manner. It is one of the finest examples,"" Murthy said in an interview. 
  
  ""At this point, the board feels that professionals who created and ran this company are slowly handing over the charge to a younger lot of people who will carry the baton for many more years,"" Kamath said in an interview. 
  
  ""In that process, there is a whole lot of handholding, mentoring, building of leadership talent, engagement of customer when required, in that process teaching the younger people, is required,"" Kamath added. Around a year ago, Cornell University professor Jeffrey Sean Lehman, an independent director on the Infosys board and chairman of the nominations committee, along with Deepak M Satwalekar and Kamath started a search for Murthy's replacement. A few months into the search, the committee started realising that Kamath's candidature could not be ruled out just because he's also on the nominations committee. 
  
  This was also the time when Infosys increased the retirement age for board members from 65 years to 70 years - a clear indication that Kamath was among the top candidates being considered for the post. 
  
  Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories""After he became a potential candidate, Kamath recused himself from the selection committee and the process,"" said Lehman. In August, Lehman had told ET that it's technically feasible for one of the nominations committee members to be considered for the chairman's post. 
  
  Some management experts and industry observers praised Infosys' transition plans saying it was done in an orderly manner. ""They are the first among major Indian companies to go through this transition,"" John McCarthy, senior vice-president and principal analyst, Forrester Research, said in a recent interview. ""It's always a challenge when you move the original management out. So far, they have done it in a transparent and orderly manner."" 
  
  ""Infosys needed an outsider. It had become too insider-involved and reached a plateau, they were running out of ideas for change. They needed a new sort of approach. This is where Kamath fits. He transformed ICICI from a sleepy organisation to the largest private sector bank when he left,"" a former ICICI Bank colleague said about Kamath. 
  
  Clearly, Kamath's stature as one of the top Indian corporate leaders helped him get the job, but can he become the door-opener Infosys has been missing ever since Nandan Nilekani quit in 2007? 
  
  ""Clearly, Infosys has gone for somebody who can help them do management transition and not necessarily open doors like Nandan did,"" a brokerage analyst in Mumbai said, requesting anonymity. Some analysts said Infosys could have looked at leaders at McKinsey, Citibank or even Pepsi for bringing a global, high-stature profile. 
  
  For instance, Nandan leveraged his equation with CEOs at customers such as BT, which until a few years ago was Infosys' top customer accounting for nearly $300 million in annual revenues. Over the past two years, rivals TCS and Wipro have successfully made inroads into BT and today earn more from the UK telecom operator than Infosys. 
  
  ""This is just a cosmetic change - from Kris to Shibu is not a big shift,"" said another analyst at a US-based brokerage firm. The reason behind such sentiment has to do with the intensely competitive nature of the IT industry. 
  
  Bigger rival TCS has been increasing its lead and fourth-placed Cognizant Technologies, snapping at Wipro's heels, has shown that it is a force to reckon with.

  In the past six months, the stock of technical textile player Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn has fallen by 44% against the drop of 5% in the ET Textile index. But those investors in the company’s stock for the long term need not worry since the company’s fundamentals and outlook for the coming quarters look promising. 
  
  Increased focus in high-margin technical textile business and retailing would drive the company’s future growth. The company has undertaken expansion of capacities across its various segments, including technical fabric, denim, fusible interlining fabric and terry towels. 
  
  Through this expansion, the company will expand its technical textile capacity from six million meters to 64.5 million metres by September 2011. It plans to expand the terry towels capacity by five times to 15,000 tonne and double its fusible interlining and denim capacity to 12.5 million meters and 40 million meters, respectively. 
  
  Technical textile, as such, is a high-margin business segment of the textile sector. It caters to sectors such as construction, automobile, agriculture and medicine. 
  
  The scope and rate of growth in technical textile is higher than home and apparel textiles. Shri Lakshmi Cotsyn is a market leader in this segment and derives more than 32% of its total revenues from this business segment. Hence, the huge expansion of its technical textile (almost 16 times) stands in good stead for the company. The company is set to benefit from the doubling of its home furnishing and fabrics segments. 
  
  The fabrics segment includes denim, bottom weight, blended, quilted and embroidery and home furnishing includes terry towels and bed sheets. Both these segments, in all, contribute more than 28% to the company’s total revenues.Shri Lakshmi plans to open 1,500 multi-brands retail outlets on a franchise model in this fiscal. This, along with its rapid capacity expansion in denim and fabric segments, would improve realisations. 
  
  In the third quarter ending March 2011 (its fiscal ends in June), the company’s net profit increased by around 9% to Rs 27.7 crore on a year-on-year basis. Also, its net sales jumped by around 14.3% to Rs 437.8 crore. After witnessing a sharp fall in the past year’s June quarter, the company’s operating profitability is once again closer to the year-ago level of above 16%.

  What has been your portfolio strategy of late because last time when we interacted with you on this forum, your strategy was to buy defensives and you were clearly looking at buying large cap banks?
   
  We were already invested in large cap banks and as I had said while the near term looks like there could be some margin pressure, but given the opportunities over the long term and the fact that some of these banks have now focus on asset quality, we do not see significant risk in owning these banks, so therefore we said we would own some of the PSU as well as the private sector banks. Our strategy continues to be the same, we always look at valuations, taking into account certain long term assumptions, while there are lot of noise on a near term basis and it would start again now with the quarterly numbers coming out. We clearly look at the long term opportunities and normalise our numbers and with the valuations look attractive we would go ahead and invest. At this point if you look at our portfolio as of last month I think the Quantum Mutual Fund would have had cash of around 11% or 12% and that is what the fund managers indicated that they would use if the markets or valuations became more attractive.

Ashwani Gujral: Bata India was a day trading call and it has done well enough. If we have a couple of days' point of view, we can easily take profits. However, a long term breakout has happened above the 735-740 levels. We could expect another 250 points on the upside over the medium term in case the trend sustains. 

 So, levels of 1000 in the medium term are not unlikely. This stock has broken out after a long consolidation, which it has done all the way from August 2011. So, breaking out of a six-month consolidation on very good volume is always positive. This shows that any consumption, globally or locally is likely to get into the next leg of the rally.

Hemang Jani: From the large cap space, one can definitely look at some of the private sector banks like ICICI Bank, Federal Bank and Axis Bank, which have corrected about 5% to 7% in the past few trading sessions, where the numbers have been by and large good. We think that, overall though there might be volatility around that space, an upside potential is about 20-25% from current levels.

It has posted a consolidated revenue growth of 21%, the highest over the past three quarters, owing to the launch of its limited competition generic products in the United States and favourable currency movement. 

 The operating margin of 26% is also the highest since the beginning of the financial year. At Rs 476 crore, the company’s net profit is double than that in the corresponding quarter two years ago. 

 
  The company’s generics business in the US benefited from the launch of limited competition products, including Tricor, Trizivir and Cymbalta. However, the branded business, which has four main products, suffered a slowdown in the US and remains a matter of concern. With most of the trade-related issues pertaining to the new drug pricing policy getting settled, the company’s domestic business recovered smartly and posted a 14% growth in revenues – higher than the industry’s single-digit growth. 

 Revenues from the Japanese business were dented on account of currency depreciation and negative performance of its subsidiary Irom. In a short span of two years, Lupin has emerged as one of the most promising pharma stocks. It is now the second most valuable pharma company on the bourses.

 Shares of Amtek Auto lost almost a third of its market capitalisation in three trading days of this week. 

 The component maker said it is exploring various means of fundraising. ""There is temporary cash flow mismatch in the company and to mitigate the present situation, the promoters have already infused Rs 75 crore and if required in future will also infuse more funds. The company is also exploring various means of fundraising,"" the statement said.

 ""The group companies have lost nearly one-third of their market capitalisation (about Rs 4,300 crore) since the start of August,"" said an ET report. There are four listed companies in the Amtek Group. 

 Amtek Auto is the parent company, which holds stakes in Castex (formerly Amtek India), Metalyst Forgings (formerly Ahmednagar Forgings) and JMT Auto.

 The stock of Amtek Auto was also excluded from the derivative segment from September, this year. This led to investors unwinding its positions, say experts.

NSE's stock option strategy pays off as volumes soar,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/nses-stock-option-strategy-pays-off-as-volumes-soar/articleshow/19586028.cms,m.economictimes.com,NSE's stock option strategy pays off as volumes soar," MUMBAI: Stock option volumes in the market are up with the country's leading bourse, National Stock Exchange, trying out a new strategy to attract investors. 

 Since April 1, the exchange has reduced the strike price interval for stock options -- a move that has given more investors greater opportunities to trade. 

 ""It's like introducing a new station in a railway route... so, more people can get into the train,"" said a broker. 

 The average daily stock option trading volumes in April has been Rs 11,900 crore so far as against Rs 9,738 crore in February and Rs 9,564 crore in March. These numbers are arrived by multiplying the stock price with number of contracts traded. 

 Thus, the higher number for January (at Rs 12,982 crore) was primarily because of to higher stock prices then. NSE's benchmark Nifty index was hovering between 5,800 and 6,1000 in January while it touched a low of 5,500 in April. 

 Simply put, if the strike price available in the L&T call and put was earlier at an interval of Rs 50, the NSE has now reduced this to Rs 20. So, if traders could take position in call and put options of L&T at Rs 1,350-1,400-1,450 at an interval of 50 points, the new rule enables them to also take positions at Rs 1380-1400-1420 and further, at intervals of 20. 

 ""The new strike price rule will definitely bring incremental liquidity in stock options segment in a sustained manner,"" said Siddharth Bhamre, head of derivative at the Mumbai-based Angel Broking. 

 According to Sundararaman R, senior vice-president and head of new products at NSE, the new strike price is contributing 32% of trading volumes in L&T, 42% in ICICI Bank and 33% in Tata Motors, which are among the most liquid stock options traded on NSE. 

 
  ""Overall, the newly introduced strike price is contributing 25% to the total stock option volumes on NSE... The correct way to see rise in interest due to change in rule is to consider volumes in the newly introduced strike price, which is up significantly,"" he said. 

 NSE has said that it could also include yet another strike price between the previous strike prices on an intra-day basis depending on market conditions. Market experts say it is like providing a constant supply of instruments to woo traders from rival bourses. 

 ""As premiums and liquidity are lower in far out-of-money stock options, preference is to trade in at-the-money or in-the-money options, thus paying higher premiums. Now with the availability of new strikes, positions can be created with lower premiums,"" said a ICICI Direct note to clients. 

 ""You can now take a higher number of lots in near-the-money options with the same funds as compared to ATM/ITM options previously,"" the note said. 

 This is NSE's second attempt to make the segment more attractive. In 2010, the exchange switched from American to European style stock options to counter BSE's delivery-based settlement. European stock options are only exercisable on the expiry date, cutting the overnight volatility risk in the underlying asset for sellers. American-style stock options are exercisable any time before the expiry date.

In a chat with ET Now, Anish Damania, Head-Institutional Equities, IDFC Securities, shares his view on the oil and gas sector. 
 
 
ET Now: Interesting moves when it comes to the oil and gas pack. One of course the crude cool off benefiting and secondly, it seems like there is going to be a decisive decision this time around on the gas pricing too. What is the sense that you are getting about the demand one is seeing of late for names like an ONGC or for that matter even Reliance, also the entire OMC basket?
 
 
Anish Damania: So petrol prices have already been in line with the market prices. So as the crude prices have fallen from a high of about $113-114 to $102, there is a correction even in the petrol prices which have been coming up. So we have seen two cuts in petrol prices come up. Diesel on the other hand continued to be subsidies. So they want to bridge that gap as much as possible.
 
 So this allows them to bridge that gap quicker than expectations. So the increase in diesel price is also good because that reduced the subsidy and as far as ONGC is concerned, they would be the major gainers of any cut in subsidy because they will have to bear that much less burden. So if one were to look at that, then ONGC is the biggest gainer in this. As far as Reliance is concerned, Reliance is more a function of how the GRMs are behaving and how the differential between crude and light crude is behaving. the more the difference the better is the outlook for Reliance.
 
 So at this point of time, Reliance till the time gas pricing is decided, we will see that trade about current levels or little bit higher. But in case of ONGC, definitely subsidies are falling. So they are the major beneficiaries there and that story continues and if gas pricing comes up, that will be an added benefit to ONGC.

In another interaction with top B-school students, he said in the next 10 years, at least three Indian pharma companies will become global players with innovative drugs in all the markets. While valuations — price-to-earnings multiple of some of the pharma companies may appear expensive, optimists would focus on the earnings growth estimate of the top 10 for the next two years.

 The pharma index has outperformed most other cyclical sector indices and the CNX Pharma index has gained 73% in the past year against 29% gains of the CNX Nifty. Companies mentioned in the table have been consistently meeting their earnings expectations and chances are they would continue to do so over the next few years. According to Bloomberg data, earnings estimates of these top 10 companies are likely to grow in the range of 17% to 68% CAGR over the next two years, and are available at FY17 earnings multiple of 15 to 26. Amid uncertainty over capex and loan growth taking off and the valuation and earnings mismatch of several cyclical companies, it would not come as a surprise if investors prefer pharma stocks.

Excerpts:  ET Now: Do you see areas of value in real estate or is it all avoid for now?  Anand Tandon: No. Other than HDFC, which is obviously the most expensive of the lot, some of the others are reasonably priced. My own favourite would be LIC Housing where the institutional backing ensures that you have no issue in terms of capital and the growth will be reasonable without being flashy.  valuations are also relatively cheap. Rather than playing real estate, there is no question in my mind that the better way to play that sector is to buy it through the housing finance companies.  	ET Now: Sharda Cropchem has had a good listing, a lot of people have applied to it as well, do you have an opinion here?  	Anand Tandon: There is an interesting business model there where you are basically trying to focus on getting the registrations and then completely outsourcing the material. The simple question is that what is the risk that supply chain will not collapse?  	We have a situation in this country today where a large part of the pharma industry is actually determined, also dependent on China and a similar problem arises there as well. So while on the face of it, it looks like business which has very high protection as well as very high margins and consequently ROEs.  	To my mind, the risk is also fairly significant because they do not necessarily have their own technology or the ability to find a replacement for the stock that they are buying from China. So it is a high risk venture. The numbers will probably still justify themselves for a while but with the kind of upside that it has already seen, I would be a little hesitant at these prices. "

 ""However, the upside also seems capped to at 8300 in Nifty currently. So investors can buy on dips and traders can ride directional waves with due caution,"" he adds.

Prestige to raise Rs 216 cr from anchor investors,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/prestige-to-raise-rs-216-cr-from-anchor-investors/articleshow/6733424.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Prestige to raise Rs 216 cr from anchor investors,"
  BANGALORE: Bangalore-based real estate company Prestige Estates plans to mop up Rs 216 crore from anchor investors for its initial public offering (IPO), which will open on Tuesday (October 12).
  
  The firm has roped in around 20 anchor investors like Blackstone, Artha Capital, Mirae Assets Global Investment (India), Blackrock, Sundaram BNP Paribas Mutual Fund and Reliance Capital. The company plans to allocate 10% of the issue to anchor investors.
  
  “There is substantial demand from anchor investors who want to take larger exposure in the company,” said Venkat K Narayana, CFO, Prestige Estates.
  
  Anchor investors are the funds that buy a large chunk of shares a day before an IPO opens, helping in determining an approximate benchmark price for share sales. The realty firm plans to sell the shares within the price band of 172-183. 
  
  The pre-IPO valuation of Prestige Estates is 4,515-4,800 crore, while the post-IPO valuation is expected to be 5,900 crore at the upper-side of the price band. For the issue, Prestige has appointed Enam Securities, UBS, JP Morgan and Kotak Mahindra Capital as its book-running lead managers. Shares offered through the IPO are proposed to be listed on the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  The realty major would be diluting 20% stake in the company. Post IPO, Prestige’s promoter holding will drop to around 80%. Irfan Razack, Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack are its three co-promoters.
  
  The Prestige IPO will open on October 12 and close on October 14. Prestige aims to use the fund from the IPO for existing projects and new launches across verticals in addition to paying back debt.
  
  “We will use 15-20% of IPO proceeds to repay debt, 65% to invest in ongoing projects and the remainder as working capital,” said Mr Narayana.
  
  As of June 2010, Prestige had a consolidated net debt of 1,700 crore. For the year ended March 2010, the company had a total income of 1,086 crore.

Prospects of monetary stimulus fuel a fresh gold rally,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/prospects-of-monetary-stimulus-fuel-a-fresh-gold-rally/articleshow/21094151.cms,m.economictimes.com,Prospects of monetary stimulus fuel a fresh gold rally,"NEW YORK: Gold extended its biggest weekly jump since 2011 and other precious metals rallied on prospects the US will maintain monetary stimulus. The Australian dollar gained and Asian stocks fell ahead of data economists project will show China’s economy slowed in the second quarter.
 
 Gold climbed 0.2% to $1,288.02 an ounce by 10:20 am in Tokyo, as palladium headed for a one-month high. The so-called Aussie strengthened 0.2% after sliding to the weakest level since August 2010 July 12. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index excluding Japan index fell 0.2%, with markets in Tokyo closed for a holiday. Futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 0.1% after the gauge reached a record July 12. Crude dropped 0.4% and corn futures sank.
 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S Bernanke said last week that the US would need very accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future, bolstering gold's allure as a store of value. China’s economy, the world’s second-largest, expanded 7.5% in the three months to June 30, according to the median of 45 estimates before data due on Monday, after growth slowed to 7.7% in the first quarter. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said July 12 that growth in 2013 may be below target, comments later corrected by the official Xinhua News Agency.
 
 “The continuing theme for gold and metals in general is Bernanke indicating a more accommodative monetary stance,” Gavin Wendt, founder of Mine Life, a mining and resources researcher in Sydney, said by phone. “China can't really grow at 9 to 10% every year. Growth now is coming off a very high base, but it’s more sustainable.”
 
 Hedge funds raised bets on higher gold prices for a second week as Bernanke’s comments damped expectations stimulus will be cut soon. Net long positions on the metal rose by 4.1%, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for July 9 showed. Gold surged 5.1% last week.
 
 “Bernanke’s comments put some positive feeling back into gold and into all commodities,” said Dan Denbow, a fund manager at the $1 billion USAA Precious Metals & Minerals Fund in San Antonio. “The Fed has been working hard to show that taking back a little bit of bond buying isn't removing accommodation, and Bernanke was very firm on that. There was a bit of a sentiment shift.”
 
 Silver rose 0.3%, while palladium gained 0.6%, poised for the highest close since June 14. Platinum climbed 0.3%, set for the highest close since June 19. Zinc, nickel, aluminum and lead for three-month delivery fell on the London Metal Exchange, as tin rose 0.3%. Copper futures lost 0.5%.

Pulses prices likely to go up around Diwali: Study,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/views/pulses-to-remain-benign-in-short-term-on-expectations-of-new-crop-arrival/articleshow/94724484.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Pulses to remain benign in short-term on expectations of new crop arrival,"New Delhi: Pulses prices have shot up during the recently concluded monsoon season, especially Kharif pulses, owing to lower production estimates compared to the last year, propelled by the erratic rainfall distribution in the key producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, and lower crop area this year as farmers shifted to competitive crops.

Tur (Arhar) dal prices have gained by about 25 per cent since June 2022 while, urad prices have surged by about 21 per cent during the same period in main mandis, and prices of moong have upped by about 13 per cent.

Chana, which is the key pulse crop in India and is cultivated in the Rabi season, remained supported during the same period due to a rally in the Kharif pulses but higher supplies of chana will keep the prices sideways over the medium-term.

Looking forward, due to the onset of Kharif crops' arrival, prices are likely to remain steady during October-December 2022 quarter, as we witnessed during most of September 2022, wherein prices capped 2 per cent range. Now, much will depend on Rabi Crop Planting’s intention, especially for China

Whether farmers will opt for more area amid a huge pileup of carryover stocks or shift area to other remunerative crops will drive the sentiment to some extent but nothing will change the outlook of Chana until we have clarity about crop progress in the Rabi season.


A look at the stock position and procurement:
Chana stocks with NAFED are around 30.5 Lakh MT, of which 15 Lakh MT will go into the buffer for states. Chana procurement by NAFED: Chana procurement stood at 25.92 Lakh MT. The state-wise breakup is as follows - Maharashtra 7.60 Lakh MT, Gujarat 5.59 Lakh MT, Madhya Pradesh 8.02 Lakh MT, Karnataka 74 KMT, Andhra Pradesh 72 KMT, Rajasthan 2.99 Lakh MT and Uttar Pradesh 26.45 KMT.

The procurement program is completed across all the above-mentioned states. Government Chana procurement target for 2022-23 is 29 Lakh MT, against which 25.92 Lakh MT procurement is completed, reaching 89 per cent of the target. In Maharashtra, procurement reached 98 per cent of the target, in Gujarat 104 per cent, in Madhya Pradesh 92 per cent, and in Rajasthan 50 per cent. 


Origo pulses crop production estimate (for the crop year 2022-23)
Tur production for 2022-23 is estimated to drop 4.64 per cent YoY at 3.66 MMT against 3.84 MMT in 2021-22. Tur acreage is down by 4.78 per cent YoY while yield is estimated flattish from the last year.

State-wise production breakup

Maharashtra's production is projected to be lower by 12.89 per cent YoY at 1.02 MMT and Karnataka is seen down by 8.08% at 0.86 MMT while production would increase in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Urad production for 2022-23 is estimated to fall by 7.92 per cent YoY at 1.60 MMT against 1.74 MMT in 2021-22. Urad acreage is down by 6.27 per cent YoY while yield is estimated to drop by 1.77 from the last year. There is more downside risk to the urad crop as rains affected the yield in Madhya Pradesh.

State-wise production breakup

Production in Madhya Pradesh is projected to increase by 10.15 per cent to 0.51 MMT, while production in Uttar Pradesh is estimated to decline by 4.23 per cent to 0.36 MMT and Maharashtra is seen down by 22.14 per cent to 0.22 MMT.

Moong production for 2022-23 is estimated higher by 3.49 per cent YoY at 1.53 MMT against 1.48 MMT in 2021-22. Moong acreage is down by 6.09 per cent YoY while yield is estimated to be higher by 9.57 per cent from the last year.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC; stock gains over 6%,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/rakesh-jhunjhunwala-bullish-on-ncc-stock-gains-over-6/articleshow/45144791.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rakesh Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC; stock gains over 6%,"MUMBAI: NCC, a Hyderabadbased engineering and construction firm, has been under the spotlight on Dalal Street of late as investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has been raising its stake in the company in recent quarters. Jhunjhunwala, known to have a following in the market, increased his stake in NCC recently through the open market and by subscribing to the rights issue.
 
 The stock surged as much as 6.89 per cent in intra day trade on Friday and hit an all-day high of 61.25 and a low of 58.10 on the BSE.
 
 He has acquired four crore shares by subscribing to the rights issue and bought 6.5 lakh shares through the open market on October 31. He held 11.85% stake as on September 30, 2014 and with this purchase, his stake has risen to 12.78%.
 
 So, what makes Jhunjhunwala bullish on NCC?
 
 Analysts believe the investor could be betting on a turnaround in the company as the rights share issue and sale of assets could cut debt. “We see an improved growth prospects for NCC with better liquidity and lower debt burden post completion of its rights issue,” said Ashish Shah, analyst, IDFC Securities.
 
 
  
 
 ""With a leaner balance sheet and negligible capital commitment towards its asset portfolio, we expect traction in NCC’s core EPC business.""
 
 NCC has risen by 33% in the last one month and 178% so far this year against ET Construction index’s gain of 13% and 47%, respectively, during the same period. Private equity firm Blackstone held 9.9%stake in NCC as on September 30.
 
 ""NCC has multiple triggers waiting in the wings, which can lead to significant cash accrual and expect robust growth in the order book over the next two years,"" said Vibhor Singhal, analyst at Phillip Capital.
 
 NCC’s Rs 600-crore rights issue has been subscribed by 1.14 times last month. The proceeds from this issue will be used for repayment of its term loans and NCDs, which stand at about Rs 600 crore currently on a standalone basis. The borrowing cost of these loans ranges from 10-15% with the weighted average borrowing cost of about 13%. With these loans now proposed to be repaid, it is expected to result in interest savings of at least Rs 60 crore for the company.
 
 Post the proposed rights issue, NCC’s debt-to-equity ratio on a standalone basis will reduce to 0.6 from 1. On a consolidated basis, it will fall to 1 from 1.4.

Rate cut hopes make traders bullish on Bank Nifty,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bank-nifty-futures-shatter-traders-hopes/articleshow/46901495.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bank Nifty futures shatter traders’ hopes,"MUMBAI: Many affluent and retail traders have been caught on the wrong foot on their recent equity derivative bets. These market participants are staring at steep losses in their positions in bank index futures contracts following the slide in these shares in the last one month.
 
 For many on Dalal Street, the words loss and risk have been forgotten concepts in the last one year or so. So, when high net-worth and retail traders took sizeable bullish bets on banks early in March, as the index hovered around record levels, few expected the upward momentum to reverse. Now, a month later, with the Bank Nifty still almost 6% below its peak, traders are wondering whether to stay put or book losses. They had built long positions in Bank Nifty futures in the March series when the index was around 19,800-20,000 on expectations the Reserve Bank of India would continue to ease monetary policy, even after surprising the market with two rate cuts this year. The Bank Nifty closed at 18,800.85 on Friday.
 
 “Traders were anticipating that the RBI would continue to cut rates and that Bank Nifty would move from strength to strength. There are many who are stuck,” said Siddarth Bhamre, head — derivatives and technical research, Angel Broking. The slide in Bank Nifty in line with the broader market started in the first week of March but traders stuck to their positions on hopes the index would rebound soon. They rolled over their bets to the April futures and options series on hopes that the markets, including bank shares, would rebound, helping them minimise losses or even eke out small profits. The Bank Nifty bounced back to almost 19,000 levels but has been unable to cross that level.
 
 “Some of the clients have booked losses but several others are hanging in there. They will wait some more time because there is a feeling that the downside is limited,” said the head of the high net-worth desk at a retail brokerage. “They will decide whether to roll over based on the rollover cost.” Fund managers say the fourthquarter results would be the next trigger for banks though a lot of the pessimism over earnings disappointment has been discounted. “Banks will find it difficult to move up in a big way from the current levels because results may not have anything in them and there are no triggers especially on the economy front,” said V Balasubramanian, senior fund manager at IDBI Mutual Fund.
 
 Analysts do not expect the Bank Nifty to cross 19,500 in the near term, unless the benchmark indices move up sharply. “Unless the Nifty does not see sharp upsides, we are not seeing much of a rally in the Bank Nifty,” added Bhamre.

  Bond yields came off one week lows on Thursday after top policymakers said they were concerned about soaring prices, raising the possibility of an off-cycle rate hike by the central bank. 
  
  The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond ended at 7.64%, off the day’s low of 7.54%, its lowest since June 10. It had ended at 7.59% on Wednesday. Volumes were heavy at Rs 16,675 crore ($3.6 billion) on RBI’s trading platform. 
  
  India plans to buy back Rs 10,000 crore of bonds via a multiple price auction on June 18, RBI said on Wednesday. An expected outflow of over Rs 136 lakh crore between late May and June toward third-generation (3G) spectrum auction payments, advance taxes and broadband auction payments has tightened liquidity with banks and sent cash rates higher. 
  
  However, hawkish comments from top policymakers have investors see a greater chance of an early interest rate hike despite a slight easing in food and fuel price inflation. 
  
  India’s inflation rate has reached uncomfortable levels and some, action from the central bank, is needed to curb demand-side pressures, C Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council said on Thursday. 
  
  Also, on Thursday, RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty said domestic inflation was a bigger concern than other global factors. 
  
  The one-year rate fell in the morning on hopes the buyback will ease the tight cash conditions but the policymakers’ comments pushed it higher. The rate was at 5.50%, up from an intra-day low of 5.31% and up from Wednesday’s close of 5.41%. The five-year rate that closely followed federal bond yields on Thursday, was at 6.87%, 2 basis points above its previous close. It hit a low of 6.77% in the morning. The government is also due to sell Rs 11,000 crore of bonds on Friday. 
  
  In interest rate futures market on NSE, with the 10-year benchmark paper as the underlying, the June contract implied an yield of 7.8782% while the September contract was not traded.

  Do you see KRBL, an exporter of basmati rice, benefiting from the increase in rice rices?
   
  Yes. The company seems like benefiting greatly from the price rise. Since there has been a significant crop failure in Pakistan, the realisation has become very high. Apart from that, the company has undertaken a strong expansion programme. It looks like the company is well positioned to take advantage of the export boom and the scarcity of rice production that happened because of some of the geographical factors. So, my call obviously is to recommend a buy on this counter.

 We have not yet seen the managements turning extremely optimistic and nobody has been going overboard. Even if you look at TCS’ management, the body language shows that they are fairly cautious.
 
 They may be of view that things may not be as bad as we thought. This could be the right time to get into these IT names as the valuation will otherwise get stretched again. Right now, Infosys and Wipro probably are…TCS of course is a different.

  In this sort of a market, it becomes very difficult what you can accumulate but clearly it is not declining. Whenever the markets are coming down or it’s basically holding onto 680-700, so chances are that it will at least keep you safe if nothing else but clearly upside will need the stock getting past 760-765. 
  
  That will probably happen only once the market stabilises on the large caps, only then somebody will look at Bajaj Holdings but it seems that the stock is forming some kind of a base and it is reasonably safe to buy it here. If the market does not collapse, chances are that the risk-reward is pretty positive.

  MUMBAI: Shipping Corporation of India surged by over 8 per cent in early trade on the BSE today, a day after the government allowed the Navratna PSU to issue fresh equity to the tune of 10 per cent of its paid-up capital.
  
  Buoyed by the development, shares of the company zoomed up 8.12 per cent to hit a one-month high of Rs 181.75 in early trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  Yesterday, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had given approval for the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Shipping Corporation of India and allowed the company to issue fresh equity to the tune of 10 per cent of the paid-up capital.
  
  The government said disinvestment in SCI is expected to fetch nearly Rs 1,300 crore.

 Of the targeted pipeline, four projects have already been awarded this financial year while nine others with a total project cost of Rs 23,000 crore have been identified for bidding in the next six to eight months.
 
 ""We expect uptick in tender pipeline from traffic-based competitive bidding project (TBCB) with 8-10 projects lined up for bidding over next six to eight months. Companies in the transmission & distribution segment also share optimistic view on the order pipeline. The commentary suggests this segment is likely to see a significant improvement in outlook, given the large pipeline of tenders expected from PowerGrid (PWG), SEBs and TBCB orders over the next 18-24 months. Our preferred picks in the T&D segment are KEC (accumulate), Kalpataru Power (accumulate) and Techno Electric (not rated) in the EPC space and Alstom T&D (not rated) in equipment space,"" brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report.
 
 Around Rs 14,100 crore worth of transmission projects were awarded through tariff-based bidding in 2014-15. Overall, at the central level, 26 projects have been bid out so far. Our interaction with PWG and various companies suggests a possibility of Rs 80,000 crore - Rs 1,00,000 crore bid between PWG, TCBC and SEBs over the next 18-24 months.
 
 ""On a thumb rule basis, 55-60 per cent of ordering is likely for transmission lines, where KEC, Kalpataru, L&T and Tata Projects will be the key beneficiaries and 40-45 per cent ordering will be for sub-stations and equipment like transformers/reactors/insulators/conductors, HVDC and new technology products like SVC/STATCOM, where the key beneficiaries would be ABB, SIEMENS and Alstom. Ordering is also increasingly dominated by high-technology products (765kv/HVDC/GIS, SVCs etc.),"" the brokerage said.
 
 In line with the government’s ‘Make in India’ programme, PWG has focused on improving domestic manufacturing in various products (765 Kv transformers/reactors, 765 Kv GIS equipment, 800KV HVDC equipment, SVC/STATCOM, conductor/insulator/EHV cable) by making domestic manufacturing facility necessary for most of the products. ""This will create a level-playing field for companies like ABB, Siemens and Alstom T&D, who already have manufacturing facilities in India,"" the report said.

 Elsewhere, brass and select copper varieties also moved up on better offtake from consuming industries. 

 While, copper utensils scrap eased owing to lack of industrial buying support. 

 Globally, most industrial metals continued to rally on the LME and hit multi-month highs buoyed by strong US economic recovery momentum underpinned by minutes of the US Federal Reserve's and better-than-expected China's factory sector output data. 

 Nickel spiked by Rs 10 per kg to Rs 1,255 from Thursday's closing level of Rs 1,245 and tin firmed up by Rs 5 per kilo to Rs 1,615 as against Rs 1,610. 

 Brass sheets cutting, copper cable scrap, copper wire bar and copper sheets cutting all inched up by Re 1 per kg each to Rs 359, Rs 495, Rs 523 and 474, respectively.

Sensex@record high: How to play the market from here,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sensex-nifty-near-record-highs-heres-what-should-investors-do/articleshow/93614415.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sensex, Nifty near record highs. Here's what should investors do","It was expected to be a bear market rally, a short-term relief. While the jury is out, the ongoing rally has lasted longer, much to Dalal Street's surprise. Valuations are again looking expensive and technical charts are sending overbought readings, and yet the market is not cautious, as the narrative has changed on inflation, even as the Fed has shown no sign of going soft.

The reason why this leg of the rally has lasted longer is the cooling of inflation, expectations of central banks taking a measured approach to inflation and growth, and, at home, the fact that consensus earnings, which were supposed to be badly hit in June quarter due to full-scale impact of inflation, has seen only a 2.7 per cent downgrade this earnings season.

Profits for Nifty50 firms have risen 23 per cent YoY in the June quarter, led by the BFSI sector. Excluding BFSI, profit grew 18 per cent YoY for Nifty50 firms. This is even as companies such as Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, SBI, HDFC and BPCL posted weaker-than-expected results.

Add to that the comeback of foreign investors, who have bought shares worth Rs 22,453 crore in August so far.

""Risk appetite globally has increased and a lot of money is moving to equities. Investors have faith that central banks and governments globally will tackle macro issues relating to inflation and growth well. Corrections have been small in terms of value and time and fresh buyings are happening every fall,"" said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities.

Jasani said economies globally may or may not do well, but large corporations may keep growing.

""If you are overweight on equities, it may be the time to sell on rallies and re-enter on dips. If you are underweight, keep accumulating gradually. But if you are equal-weight, wait for dips to add stocks,"" Jasani said.

At the day's high of 60,238.70, the BSE Sensex has rallied 9,317.48 points or 18.3 per cent over its 52-week low of 50921.22 hit on July 17.

It is a case of history repeating itself, said Rahul Shah, Co-Head of Research at Equitymaster.

""Whenever the Sensex has not entered a bear market, the reversal has been quite quick historically and the same has happened this time also. The icing on the cake is that, unlike last time, valuations are much more reasonable this time around. Although the broader market is by no means cheap, it isn't prohibitively expensive either,"" Shah said.

Shah said investors looking for fundamentally strong stocks at attractive valuations could still find pockets of undervaluation.

That said, Niteen Dharmawat, Co-Founder, Aurum Capital, said one should not expect similar kinds of returns that the market has given in the last couple of weeks.

""We will have to curtail our return expectations because we already have seen a significant amount of rally,"" he said.

Kenneth Andrade, Old Bridge Capital said whatever is happening, it is unexpected because India had two great years leading up to 2022 and a correction was more or less expected in this cycle.

""We are trading fairly where we left off at the beginning of the year. That is how I think the market will move over the next couple of quarters. I mean the data points are quite simple; they are very macro-linked. We have to see how central banks globally address all of what is happening out there,"" he said.

Stable demand for housing loan to drive HDFC growth,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/stable-demand-for-housing-loan-to-drive-hdfc-growth/articleshow/5482768.cms,m.economictimes.com,Stable demand for housing loan to drive HDFC growth,"India's largest mortgage finance company, HDFC, continued with its strategy of improving asset quality and converting more approvals into disbursements in the quarter to December 2009. Gross non-performing assets or bad loans were marginally lower at 0.94% of portfolio at the end of the December quarter compared to 1.01% in the year ago period. That a revival is ahead seems to be reflected in more loan approvals getting converted into disbursements. HDFC converted as much as 88% of approvals into disbursements in the December 2009 quarter. Indeed, the tide had turned in the quarter to September 2009, when 85% of approvals were converted into disbursements. Prior to that borrower interest was lukewarm given the extent of the slowdown and with relatively higher interest rates. Disbursements formed 81% of approvals in FY09. With a y-o-y growth of 18%, HDFC’s loan book grew at the same pace in the December 2009 quarter as in the previous quarter. Its disbursals aggregated Rs 11,185 crore during the third quarter after plunging to Rs 8,688 crore in the June 2009 quarter. Clearly, there has been a recovery for HDFC after its profit fell by 15% in the previous fiscal due to high interest rates and sluggish loan demand. With the improvement in spread and growth in loan book, profits grew 23% in December 2009. Its spread also improved at 2.36% in the quarter to Dec ember compared to 2.2% in the September 2009 quarter. Meanwhile, profits for the December 2009 quarter included profits on sale of investment, which was a one-off item. Excluding this one-off item, profit growth was 16%. HDFC has moderated its expenses, with its wage bill and other operating expenses remaining more or less flat on a y-o-y basis. This has helped it to maintain profit growth, at a time when the asset book is not growing at the heady pace which it recorded in the past.HDFC should be able to maintain its spread in the coming quarters, considering the easy liquidity conditions. Considering that interest rates are expected to be stable, at least in the near term and with a rebound in growth, demand for housing loans could remain roughly at the same level as seen in the past six months. It is quite likely that HDFC would post a profit growth in double digits, going forward."

  NEW DELHI: Tata Motors on Thursday reported that its full-year profit more than trebled, driven by a strong performance of British luxury brands, Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR). India's largest truck and bus maker posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,274 crore for the fiscal year ended March, compared with Rs 2,571 crore a year ago. The rise in profit was largely driven by the near Rs 7,700 crore (£1.04 billion) net profitability of its JLR unit, which was initially loss making, but has turned around in the last few quarters. 
  
  ""The improved profitability was driven by higher volumes and pricing of these (JLR) products across various markets,"" chief financial officer C Ramakrishnan told reporters. The company's net profit from domestic operations, however, dropped 19% to 1,812 crore, compared with Rs 2,240 crore in 2009-10. An analyst tracking Tata Motors said high commodity prices and lower sales could check profitability of the company, and the auto sector in general. 
  
  Tata Motors, part of the salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, builds utility vehicles, cars and the ultra-cheap Nano. It acquired Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor in 2008 for $2.3 billion. JLR's global sales volume for the year rose 26% to 2.43 lakh units, helped by improved market conditions, better market mix and strong demand from China, which has emerged as one of the strongest markets for the brand. 
  
  The company's global sales for the year rose 24% to 10.80 lakh vehicles, backed by its wide product portfolio. Consolidated revenue rose by a third to Rs 1.23 lakh crore. In the domestic market, sales of Tata's passenger vehicles, including Fiat and JLR vehicles distributed in India, grew 23% year-on-year to 3.19 lakh units, helped by rising personal incomes and easier finance. In the commercial vehicles segment, its sales jumped 22.7% year-on-year to 458,828 units, mainly because of improved infrastructure. In India, the demand for cars is expected to moderate because of higher fuel costs and interest rates, with growth pegged at 12 -15% for this fiscal year. It was 30% last year. 
  
  Rising raw materials prices had forced Indian car makers, including Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki, to raise prices in recent months. Tata Motors' shares closed up 2.5% at Rs 1,162.40 on BSE, ahead of the results.

 Top rated Rural Electrification Corporation's tax free bond issue was on Monday oversubscribed four times from its total issue size. This issuer, however offered rates less than what Power Finance Corporation and NTPC had offered a few weeks ago as the Reserve Bank of India slashed the borrowing cost more than what it was estimated.
 
 The company collected a total of around Rs 2,800 crore versus Rs 700 crore, the total issue. The REC bonds offer retail investors as much as 7.43 per cent for a 20-year maturity, 7.14 per cent and 7.34 per cent with 10- and 15-year maturities, respectively, which are also higher than similar-maturity secondary market yields.
 
 Tax free bond prices are linked to the benchmark bond yields, which move following RBI rate actions. ""Despite fall in interest rates, there is no appetite loss among investors,"" said Ajay Manglunia, executive vice president - fixed income at Edelweiss Finance. ""Retail investors has seen this issue as an opportunity to earn higher rate over a long period,"" Out of total investors more than 47 per cent were retail. They rush for longer maturities.
 
 Tax free bonds are the best possible investment option for investors in the 20 per cent and 30 per cent tax brackets when compared with bank fixed deposits. ""With interest rates moving down there is rush for tax free bonds amongst retail and HNI investors. The next issue is expected to be from NHAI for Rs 12,000 crores, where retail investors can expect atleast a 50 per cent allotment as compared to a 22 per cent allotment in REC bonds,"" says Vikram Dalal, Managing Director, Synergee Capital.
 
 Country's largest lender the State Bank of India offers 7.5 per cent fixed deposit rate with two-three year maturities.
 
 For investors who are in the middle tax bracket, the post-tax return works out to 5.96 per cent, while for those in the highest tax bracket the return works out to be 5.18 per cent. As compared to this, the REC tax free bond offered a maximum of 7.43 per cent in the 20 year category, a clear 225 basis points higher than SBI's fixed deposit rate.

Gaurav Mehta: We actually did reverse our stance on Infosys 24 hours ago.

"UltraTech, other cement companies good buys on margin boost",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ultratech-other-cement-companies-good-buys-on-margin-boost/articleshow/49992500.cms,m.economictimes.com,"UltraTech, other cement companies good buys on margin boost"," Lower prices of essential commodities and seasonality of business are expected to enhance the operating margins of cement companies in the range of 200-400 basis points in the second half of the current fiscal.
 
 This may offer the much-needed trigger for cement stocks that have failed to report meaningful returns in the past six months. Over the past year, pet coke, coal, and diesel prices have fallen in the range of 6-25%. This has reduced operating costs of cement companies in terms of lower costs.
 
 On average, power, and fuel costs of prominent cement companies fell by 13% in the September 2015 quarter in comparison with the corresponding quarter last year. In addition, their freight costs also fell by nearly 5%. Power, oil, fuel and freight costs together eat into 20-30% of net sales revenues of most cement companies.
 
 
 

 
 With crude oil expected to remain stagnant over the next year due to oversupply, costs of pet coke and diesel - both derivatives of crude - are expected to be range bound, cushioning the input costs for cement makers.
 
 They are also expected to benefit from higher construction activities in the second half of the fiscal, which often result in higher cement prices. It is observed that in the second half of a fiscal, prominent cement makers report close to 100 basis points jump in their operating profit margins.
 
 Given these factors, analysts estimate that cement prices to go up in the range of 200-300 basis points, which in turn would boost operating profit margins of cement companies in the range of 200-400 basis points.
 
 The ET cement index fell by 4.6% in the past six months in tandem with a similar fall in the benchmark CNX Nifty.
 
 Investors may expect a turnaround in stock prices given the improved revenue visibility and expectations of better profitability in the coming quarters.

Hemindra Hazari: I would look upon this as a buying opportunity. You have to acknowledge the fact that pharma counters have performed exceedingly well.
 
 Hence, profit booking is obvious. In addition, there have been some concerns over cross-currency headwinds that may hurt the fourth quarter numbers of drug makers.
 
 Earnings could also be impacted by lack of product approvals in the US and regulatory issues that have come in.
 
 The analyst community is just voicing some caution. This is probably an opportunity for some to book profits. Having said that, I would like to add that this is one of the sectors which I have liked and will continue to like. In India, it will be the external demand triggers, rather than domestic demand triggers which will be more important.

  The sale of low-growth, low-margin payment processing business would enhance 3i Infotech’s focus on its core IT products and services business. But it will take at least two quarters for its profitability to reflect the positive impact of the development. 
  
  The proceeds of $137 million (around Rs 610 crore) from the sale of the transaction services division to Cerberus Capital Management will be utilised to reduce the current debt burden by nearly 30% to Rs 1,500 in the near term. 
  
  This will also reduce 3i Infotech’s debt-equity ratio to 1.2 from 1.6. In 2007-2008, mid-tier IT player 3i Infotech had entered the US payment processing market through acquisitions of Regulus, J&B Software, and JP Morgan’s unit. 
  
  This was a part of 3i Infotech’s strategy to strengthen its presence in the US banking and finance segment. The strategy, however, hit the roadblock during the subprime crisis in late 2008. The revenue from this segment since then has remained sluggish. For instance, the total annual revenue earned by the three units at the time of acquisition was over Rs 800 crore. 
  
  With revenue of Rs 820 crore in FY11, it has hardly budged from the threeyear-ago level. In FY11, revenue from 3i Infotech’s IT products and services rose by 14% whereas it was 10.4% lower for the transaction services. 
  
  According to company’s MD and global CEO V Srinivasan, the sale is highly lucrative. He mentions the company had spent $25 million (Rs 115 crore) of internal accruals (equity) towards the total purchase value of $ 115 million (around Rs 530 crore) for the three units in 2008. 
  
  The company has earned $ 45 million (over Rs 207 crore) in operating profit before depreciation so far. Considering this and the current sale value, return on equity turns out to be more than 200%, highlights Mr Srinivasan. 
  
  The latest sale will lower the company’s future net profit but the impact will be mitigated largely due to the reduction in interest cost and depreciation. Srinivasan pegs a decline of one rupee or 8% in the annual earnings per share. But in the long run, its profitability is expected to improve by 100-200 basis points now that the company has sold the low-margin business.

ET Now: How do you see the first day of the new futures and options series?
 
Mitesh Thacker: Thursday's close has been good. The intraday buying seen during the day confirmed that 8,320-8,330 on Nifty should now act as the immediate support level. Bank Nifty has just managed to sneak above 18,500 despite the fact that the last half-an-hour of trade was volatile for it.
 
 In case, Bank Nifty sustains above these levels, despite some kind of weakness in the CNX IT, I would maintain a slightly positive bias for the next few days. Bank Nifty could possibly outperform along with the energy and pharma stocks. May be, these sectors will pull up the Nifty to 8,450-8,500.
 
 Meanwhile, if CNX IT continues to trade below 11,300, then it will have a 200-300 point kind of a decline. Overall, on the broad basis, Nifty might move up. That is what I will look at. I will also be trading more of long bias on individual stocks and would possibly place a couple of short calls on the IT stocks.

Amara Raja Batteries offers a good buying opportunity for investors,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/amara-raja-batteries-offers-a-good-buying-opportunity-for-investors/articleshow/16408082.cms,m.economictimes.com,Amara Raja Batteries offers a good buying opportunity for investors," The quarterly result of Amara Raja Batteries, India’s second largest battery maker, has been better than expected, justifying its recent re-rating. The company’s revenue and net profit for the first quarter of 2012-13 have zoomed up by 32% and 95%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.
 
 This stellar performance can be attributed to the increased capacity in the automotive segment and increasing demand in the UPS business. Though the rupee depreciation has taken some sheen off the significant fall in prices of lead on the London Metal Exchange (LME), the 5% fall in rupee terms (after adjusting the currency impact) helped the margin expansion.
 
 The battery demand in India continues to zoom because of frequent power cuts, leading to a rise in demand for UPS batteries, and an expanding automotive market. Though the demand from the original equipment manufacturers is not that high, it is compensated by the strong demand from the replacement market; 60% of its revenue comes from the auto segment and around 65% of its auto segment revenue comes from the replacement market.
 
 
  The battery business in India is also getting organised with a shift from unorganised to organised players. This is helping players like Amara Raja and the market leader, Exide Industries. With a strong brand franchise and efficient two-tier dealer network, Amara Raja continues to fortify its position in the current duopolistic market conditions.
 
 It has managed to register a volume growth of 14-15% across its industrial and automotive segments. This structural up-trend is also helping it improve its earnings quality.
 
 Analysts believe that the stock continues to be attractively priced despite the recent rise in its price. Compared with its expected earnings growth rate of 25-30% in the future, Amara Raja’s stock is still trading at 13 times its historical earnings.
 
 This means that its PE-to-growth ratio is still close to 0.5 times and, therefore, a further re-rating is possible. The negligible debt and sufficient cash reserve are other factors that are attracting investors to this counter because they will help Amara Raja tap the upcoming growth opportunities in India as well as in the international market without much difficulty.
 
 Selection methodology: We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the past month. The rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weightages to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell) and any improvement in rating indicates that the analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock.

"At Rs 22 lakh, MRF is most costly futures contract",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/at-rs-22-lakh-mrf-is-most-costly-futures-contract/articleshow/26545423.cms,m.economictimes.com,"At Rs 22 lakh, MRF is most costly futures contract","MUMBAI: Planning to trade in the counter of mid-cap tyre company MRF in the derivatives segment? Well, the chances are that you may not be able to afford it. A single lot of MRF futures on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) is worth more than Rs 22 lakh, making it the most expensive futures contract.
 
 As per the circular by market regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the lot size of any derivatives contract should not be less than Rs 2 lakh and shouldn’t be more than Rs 4 lakh. The lot size of MRF in the derivatives segment is 125 shares and its stock price is close toRs 18,000 per share. While the share price of MRF rose sharply this year from a low of around Rs 10,000 in November last year, NSE has not revised its lot size. When contacted, NSE said it was merely following the Sebi circular.
 
 A lot size is nothing but fixed units of a particular security that can be bought or sold in the derivatives segment. The lot size is fixed according to the price of the security and other factors.
 
 “It is surprising to see that a single lot of stock futures is worth Rs 22 lakh, which makes it impossible even for high net worth traders to take positions,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares and Securities.
 
 Traders require around 30% margin money to trade in derivatives contracts. Therefore, over Rs 6.5 lakh is needed if you were to trade in a single lot of MRF futures on the NSE.
 
 “MRF, in the first place, does not deserve to be in the derivatives segment,” said SP Tulsian, independent equity advisor. “The volumes in the MRF counter are extremely thin and the counter seems to be controlled by operators due to its expensive lot size.”
 
 Sebi has stipulated that an exchange should revise lot sizes of contracts every six months, but it has also clarified that “wherever warranted, revise the lot size by giving an advance notice of at least two weeks to the market”.
 
 In the case of MRF, market players contend that a revision was warranted, but nothing of the sort happened. Often, exchanges prefer to trade in derivatives contracts of companies that have high daily trading volumes and market depth, which check volatility and price distortion. Due to its expensive contract size, the spreads or the price gap between buy and sell orders of MRF are usually Rs 50 or more. For instance, the top buy order for MRF at around 2:30 pm on Thursday was Rs 17,860 while the sell was asking for Rs 17,925. The spreads rise in a market where there’s no volume depth.

"Bajaj Auto: Higher input costs offset sales gain, hit margins",negative,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/bajaj-autos-results-hit-by-input-cost/articleshow/6777475.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bajaj Auto's results hit by input cost,"
  The only disappointment in Bajaj Auto’s otherwise impressive results for the September 2010 quarter was the impact of the rising input cost structure. As a result, the company’s profit margin declined 150 basis points year-on-year to 20.7%, despite net sales showing an increase of 50.4% to Rs 4,341.8. Bajaj Auto is the second-largest player in the motorcycle segment.
  
  Its realisations per unit rose 4.4% compared with a year ago, but that could not fully offset the higher cost of rubber-based inputs, and the strengthening metal prices. As a result, its adjusted raw material costs as a percentage of net sales increased 440 basis points to 67% in the September quarter compared with a year earlier. 
  
  Buoyant sales of variants of its Pulsar and Discover models helped the company attain a market share of 34% in the motorcycle segment, a growth both on a sequential and year-on-year basis. Strong sales volume also helped the company’s net profit improve by 69.3% to Rs 682.1 crore compared with a year earlier.
  
  The company recently brought on stream additional production capacity at its Pantnagar plant in Uttarakhand, which would ease the supply constraints on its premium models, Pulsar and Discover. Also, tax breaks in the state and better realisations from these models should help Bajaj Auto to deal better with the rising cost structure, say analysts.
  
  Apart from raw material costs, analysts are increasingly worried about the growing competition in the motorcycle segment, with the recent entry of diversified player Mahindra & Mahindra. Also, Honda’s probable exit from Hero Honda and its plans to scale up its presence in the motorcycle segment could further put pressure on margins in this segment. 
  
  Bajaj Auto’s stock fell marginally by 0.6% to Rs 1,512.6 in a weak broader market on Tuesday but it is still not too far away from its 52-week high reached in early October. At these levels, its trailing 12 months P/E works out to be 19.2. Sector leader Hero Honda’s stock trades at a P/E of around 16. 
  
  The premium valuation of Bajaj Auto can be attributed to its superior operating margin compared with Hero Honda’s. Going ahead, analysts expect strong sales momentum of the company to continue. However, its current valuations appear to have fully factored in the future incremental growth.

 Bharti Group will continue to hold a 20 per cent equity ownership in the new company Mahindra Comviva while Tech Mahindra will own 51 per cent. 

 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch has reset estimates and raised Tech Mahindra and Satyam’s rating to Buy. 

 “Deal wins & acquisition announced by TechM over the past fortnight are likely to give the company critical scale in large strategic accounts like Hutch, KPN. Moreover, steady growth in AT&T and likely stabilization in top client BT set stage for an improved organic growth trajectory. Deal pipeline is healthy and we could see a few more closures in the next couple of quarters,” the report said. 

 The brokerage has a price target of Rs 1,150, an upside of over 25 per cent from the current market price. 

 Most brokerages are of the view that the acquisition will help strengthen Tech Mahindra expertise in the mobile VAS domain. 

 “We believe the acquisition is another step by the Tech Mahindra management to achieve its stated target of doubling revenues over the next three years. It would not only deepen TechM’s expertise in the mobile VAS domain and give access to over 100 global telecom operators, but also keep its telecom exposure at an elevated level,” said an IDFC report. 

 The brokerage is of the view that there is still some steam left for re-rating of the stock. It has maintained ‘Outperformer’ rating with a 12-month price target of Rs 1,050, based on ~12x avg. FY13-14E EPS. 

 Meanwhile, Dolat Capital Market in the report post acquisition has revised its target price upward and expects the stock to get re-rated. 

 “The positive news flow continues to reinforces our view of re-rating of the stock considering its strong business aggression organically (Dutch Telecom deal) and inorganically (Comviva and HGS Deal) to boost the revenue growth traction. We maintain Tech Mahindra as our top pick with a revised target price of Rs 1,180 (earlier Rs 1065) valued at 10x (earlier 9x) of its FY14E earnings,” the report said. 

 Shares of Tech Mahindra gained momentum after acquiring a 51 per cent stake in Bharti Group-owned mobile value-added services provider Comviva Technologies for Rs 260 crore.

ET Now: How are you viewing IT stocks right now, do you think there is a stronger case given the currency for the IT majors, the IT sector as whole actually?
 
Anand Tandon: Absolutely I have been bullish on IT for whole of this year and the rupee slipped tremendously. There are some headwinds in terms of the immigration bill and so on but that will come into affect only next year and more importantly at least near term the demand scenario looks to be a little better than what it was perhaps six months back but numbers have been reasonable not hitting the ball out of the park. We have to remember that obviously the rupee depreciation will benefit only in the near term, it is quite likely that contracts will get renegotiated sooner rather than later but that said it does help in many ways in increasing margins.

"Calculus: Recovery in China, new models may help Tata Motors",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/calculus-recovery-in-china-new-models-may-help-tata-motors/articleshow/49719878.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Calculus: Recovery in China, new models may help Tata Motors","Tata Motors reported a net loss for the September 2015 quarter, the first such loss in at least 25 quarters on account of slower growth in its Chinese market and higher expenses due to certain operating factors. While this may cause some concern among investors, the medium-term trend looks positive considering a gradual recovery in Chinese demand, scheduled launch of new models and falling input costs.
 
 The September quarter performance was marred due to certain expenses that depressed the earnings of Jaguar Land Rover, a Tata Motors' subsidiary which contributes more than 90 per cent to its revenue. JLR reported Rs 2,493 crore expense (on its books) on account of cars damaged due to the fire that erupted at Tianjin port in China where 5,800 Jaguar Land Rover's car were stored. The company has applied for the insurance claims but it will take several months to receive the insurance payout.
 
 Then, there was bunching-up of product launch costs inflating the other expenditure. The company has launched Discovery Sport (February 2015), Jaguar XE (Many 2015), Lightweight Jaguar XF (September 2015) since the beginning of the year. In addition, given that several facelift models will be introduced in the next few months, it has led to a higher average discount level per vehicle.
 
 

 
 Plummeting volumes in China hurt margins and volume growth of the company. The contribution from China's volume to the total sales volume has come down to 17.6 per cent in September quarter against 27 per cent in the same period a year ago. The fall in China's contribution has impacted profitability since vehicles sold in the world's second largest economy fetch a superior margin as compared with other geographies.
 
 Given the subdued demand, the company relaxed credit terms to Chinese dealers, thereby increasing the working capital requirement for JLR. All these factors reduced operating margins by nearly 500 bps from the year ago.
 
 Some early indicators point at revival in volumes and a possible margin improvement in the coming quarters. China's auto sales volume increased by 11 per cent in October - the first time in seven months - after the government cut tax on some car segments to boost sagging demand. JLR has launched locally produced Discovery Sport at a discount to the imported version in China. The company has guided sales volume of 500,000 JLR units for the current fiscal which seems to be achievable with China sales rebounding and double-digit volume growth in big markets such as the US and UK.
 
 Along with this, JLR will launch its two midrange sedan Jaguar XE in the US and Jaguar F Pace (a crossover) in 2016, which is expected to support volume growth.
 
 Analysts had a target price of over Rs 700 for Tata Motors' stock before the slowdown in China was visible. Back then, the company was commanding an EVEBITDA of 8-8.5. Though Chinese demand is recuperating, it is expected to be a slower recovery. Hence, there will be compression in EVEBITDA multiple, which has prompted analysts to adjust the target price in the range of Rs 480-500 per share.

Cheaper raw materials lift India Inc margins for June quarter,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/cheaper-raw-materials-lift-india-inc-margins-for-june-quarter/articleshow/48506556.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cheaper raw materials lift India Inc margins for June quarter,"MUMBAI: Buoyed by cheaper raw materials, India Inc reported better than expected margin improvement for the June quarter compared with previous quarter. Interest outgo relative to operating profit — the profit after depreciation but before interest and taxes — also fell with firms pruning finance costs.
 
 To curb interest outgo, companies resorted to issuing bonds and commercial papers (CPs), which charge alower rate than regular loans. However, barring these positive factors, sales and profit growth remained subdued during the June quarter. A sample of 2,171 companies, excluding banks and finance firms and oil & gas companies, reported a 1.3% year-on-year growth in net sales and 2.2% drop in net profit for the first quarter of 2015-16.
 
 “The sales and profit performance was mostly on expected lines. Operating margin, however, was better than expected,” said Nischal Maheshwari, head of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities.
 
 Operating margin of the sample rose 150 basis points (bps) to 17.4% from the previous quarter, close to the 17.5% margin in the June quarter of the previous fiscal. Margins improved for the first time in the April-June 2015 quarter after skidding in each of the previous three quarters. The sample also showed a 185 bps drop in interest cost as a percentage of PBIT (profit before interest & tax) to 29.4% compared with the previous quarter. However, it remained significantly higher than the year-ago level of 27%, indicating that the aggregate operating profit of India Inc did not increase as much as the rise in interest outgo.
 
 For this ratio to improve, revenue needs to grow faster than the current rate, which can only happen once demand recovers.
 
 
‘POOR CAPACITY UTILISATION’
 
 “Sales growth will be hard to come by at the moment considering poor capacity utilisation. And lower sales growth has caused India Inc’s asset utilisation to fall,” said Dhananjay Sinha, economist and strategist, Emkay Global Financial Services.
 
 Chances are the numbers could improve in the next two quarters ending September and December 2015, thanks to the base effect. Single-digit sales growth in the yearago period is likely to help India Inc report better top line. But growth led by real demand push may be visible only by the end of the current fiscal, feel analysts.
 
 “We continue to believe that any revival in earnings would commence only from the second half of FY16 (December 2016 quarter). The second quarter (September) is a seasonally slow quarter, so we may not see a significant improvement in the earnings,” said Vaibhav Agrawal, V-P & head of research, Angel Broking.
 
 The depreciation in the Chinese currency is a major event, according to some experts. “It is likely to put pressure on export-oriented companies in India in sectors such as chemicals and textiles where Indian companies compete with their Chinese counterparts,” said Maheshwari of Edelweiss.
 
 The performance across sectors during the June 2015 quarter was mixed as companies with pricing power in some sectors such as FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) and automobiles were able to take advantage of lower commodity prices. On the other hand, companies in the capital goods, power, pharmaceuticals and metals continued to perform poorly due to slack demand.
 
 
AUTOMOBILES
 
 While the earnings growth of auto companies for the June quarter was as expected, some of them surprised the street with better realisation, average discount level and margins. Backed by cost efficiencies and higher realisation per vehicle, Maruti and Bajaj Auto outlived expectations. Hero MotoCorp reported better margins. M&M expanded margins in the tractors segment despite a drop in volume. Contrary to general expectation, the management of M&M expects tractor growth to be 5% in the current fiscal. However, Hero Moto-Corp’s commentary on two-wheeler volumes caused analysts to lower estimates for FY16.
 
 
CAPITAL GOODS
 
 Paucity of orders — except for some pickup in roads and power transmission — and difficulties in project execution continue to haunt the sector. The biggest infrastructure company, L&T, reported lower than expected earnings growth. But it maintained the guidance for margin, revenue and order inflows for FY16.
 
 
CEMENT
 
 The June quarter reflected seasonal weakness to a large extent. With the exception of South-based cement companies which benefitted from improvement in demand, companies in other regions faced slow offtake. Besides low activity in infrastructure projects, slowdown in real estate construction has hit volumes. Among larger cement companies, only UltraTech could beat analyst estimates. Demand, growing at 2-3%, could more than double in the next two years as construction activities in rural and urban infrastructure and real estate projects gather steam.
 
 
FMCG
 
 It was a mixed bag: sluggish volumes, savings on cost and improved margins. Market leader Hindustan Unilever Limited maintained 6% volume growth in the domestic consumer business. Companies such as Britannia and Emami did well while most others disappointed. While tapering off of rural growth remains a concern, benign input cost is likely to provide room for margin expansion. This will allow companies to invest more in brands. The phasing out of excise duty benefits will continue to hurt the top line growth of companies such as HUL and Colgate-Palmolive. The upcoming festive season is likely to be the next trigger for growth. IT Barring Infosys, other top IT exporters including Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and HCL Technologies reported slightly lower than expected growth in dollar-denominated revenue for the June 2015 quarter. Margins dropped due to salary increases and US visa costs. Volumes are traditionally better in the September quarter. Companies are expected to do well given their strong order books and the weakness in the rupee against the dollar.
 
 
METALS
 
 Metal companies were hit by falling commodity prices and lower demand. Companies reported lower sales and profits with contraction in margin. No immediate recovery in metal prices is expected on account of the downturn in the commodity cycle.
 
 
PHARMA
 
 While Dr Reddy’s outperformed, Sun Pharma and Lupin posted disappointing numbers. Absence of any major drug launches and slowdown in drug approvals in the US impacted sales. This was partly compensated by recovery in the domestic market. Future growth will depend on the pickup in drug approvals in the US, monetisation of product pipeline and volume recovery in the domestic market.
 
 
POWER
 
 Subdued demand led to lower capacity utilisation for major power utilities. In the June quarter, all India thermal plant load factor (PLF), or capacity utilisation, stood at 62% as against 67% in the same period last year. However, companies saw an improvement in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortisation) margin due to lower fuel costs. Demand is expected to remain sluggish until industrial demand recovers.

 Industry may have less than four months of beans on hand to meet demand, according to Eric Sivry, head of agricultural options brokerage at Marex Spectron Group in London. Gains may be limited if Ghana accelerates sales of next year's harvest. “A comfortable level of forward cover for the industry would be eight to nine months or more,” Sivry said by email on Tuesday. “Many believe that Ghana may soon jump in and offer a clip of new crop.” 

 Cocoa for March delivery climbed 0.7% to $2,800 a tonne on ICE Futures in New York after earlier on Tuesday gaining to $2,820, the highest for a most active contract since September 15, 2011. Ghana is the secondbiggest grower after Ivory Coast.

But the stock has underperformed due to higher ad spends pulling down profit growth. Chances are that the situation can change during the year.
 
 
Consistent Rise in Market Share
 
 Colgate has managed to increase its market share for toothpaste every year in the last four years. The market share for toothbrushes has also increased over four years to 42.1 per cent.
 
 
Ad Spends to Moderate
 
 Two years ago, Colgate raised its ad spends to 19 per cent of sales from around 10 per cent after P&G introduced Oral-B toothpaste. A lower ad spend from now on would help improve profit margins. Analysts expect operating margins (EBIDTA) to increase by 3-4.5 per cent in the next two years.
 
 

 
 
Portfolio Premiumisation
 
 Share of premium (value added) products, such as Sensitive Pro-relief Enamel Repair and Active Salt with Neem toothpastes, in total sales has increased to 20 per cent from 10 per cent three years ago. In other countries, premium products account for a much higher share of total sales. The benefits are beginning to show. In the March quarter of 2015, the company’s operating profit was highest in the last 12 quarters.
 
 
Dividend Payout to Improve
 
 With Colgate rolling out its highest capital expenditure plans over the last two years, dividend payout fell to 65 per cent of net profit in 2014-15 from 88 per cent in 2012-13. Since the capex cycle is over, the payout is expected to be higher in the coming years.

Cotton rally forces textile mills to go for small buys,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/cotton-rally-forces-textile-mills-to-go-for-small-buys/articleshow/6661798.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cotton rally forces textile mills to go for small buys,"
  COIMBATORE & CHANDIGARH: With cotton prices at a 15-year high, textile mills are looking to buy the commodity in smaller quantities instead of the usual bulk purchases they do in the first six months of the new season. The mills are also planning to hold stocks for two months instead of six months.
  
  And the companies fear that the prices will only increase with exporters on a buying spree to ensure shipments for November. The prices of Shankar 6, a much-sought-after variety, is ruling at Rs 38,500 per candy when compared to Rs 22,500 per candy during the same period last year. While cotton prices have increased by 70% in the past one year, yarn prices have moved up by around 50%.
  
  The 30s count yarn was selling at Rs 125 per kg during the last week of September 2009 but it is ruling at Rs 185 per kg now. The 40s count yarn prices have jumped to Rs 197 per kg from Rs 132 per kg last year. For textile mills, the October-March period is crucial during which they will buy cotton in bulk quantities and store it for the rest of the year.
  
  The Ludhiana-based Nahar group, which consumes 10 lakh bales annually, is procuring cotton on a day-to-day basis. “We have a daily requirement of 3,500 bales (one bale weighs 170 kg) but are procuring 1,700 bale due to the spiralling rates,” said Nahar group’s raw material general manager Ashok Kapoor. The company is procuring Punjab’s J-34 variety for Rs 3,660-3,700 per maund (one maund equals 37.3 kg). 
  
  “We have to buy left, right and centre. But, instead of holding stock for longer period, we might opt for two months’ stock,” said Coimbatore-based Rs 803-crore KPR Mills managing director P Natraj. The vertically-integrated KPR group, which has a 2.12-lakh spindle capacity, sells 75% of the yarn it produces to Tirupur exporters while the rest is consumed internally. 
  
  Most garment manufacturers have even started getting orders for cotton blended with polyester to cut cost. Ludhiana-based Venus Garments (India), exporter of knitwear to international retailers like Wal-Mart, Old Navy and Tom Tailor, has since the past two months started manufacturing polyester-cotton blend knitted garments for a few clients. 
  
  “There is a cost-saving of over 10% with polyester filament prices at Rs 80-100 a kg,” said Venus Garments managing director Anil Jain.
  
  For the Rs 208-crore Ambika Cotton Mills, which produces compact yarn used for shirting purpose, the dependency on local cotton is around 40% of its total requirement. 
  
  “We import long-staple cotton from abroad and we have no issues on that. But on the local front, we are struggling to get cotton despite being ready to pay international prices,” said Ambika Cotton CMD PV Chandran. He added that there were concerns of ginners blending long-staple cotton with short-staple varieties after January. Spinners are now mulling an increase in yarn prices.

Cotton rises 10% on demand for exports and local consumption,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/cotton-rises-10-on-demand-for-exports-and-local-consumption/articleshow/29468255.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cotton rises 10% on demand for exports and local consumption,"PUNE: Bullish market sentiments have led to an increase of 10% in cotton prices in just about a month. Good demand for exports as well as for domestic consumption and staggered release by farmers, who are holding on to the crop anticipating the prices to move up further, have supported the uptrend in the prices of the fibre crop. 

 The market is bullish about cotton prices. “Ruling at Rs 43,000 per candy (of 356 kg each), cotton prices have increased by Rs 4,000/candy in just about a month fromRs 39,000/candy due to the bullish sentiments in the market,” said Bharat Wala, president, Saurashtra Ginners Association. 

 Demand from China, the biggest buyer of Indian cotton, is not much. But the exports to other countries have helped keep the prices firm. BS Rajpal, MD, Aurangabad-based Manjeet Cotton said, “There is good demand for Indian cotton from Bangladesh and Pakistan, for premium quality cotton.” The local demand from spinning mills is also good. “Yarn prices are buoyant supporting the uptrend in cotton prices,” said an official of a cotton trading company on condition of anonymity. 

 The MSP of long staple cotton is Rs 3,900/quintal. However, farmers are currently getting about Rs 4,800/quintal to Rs 5,200/quintal. The arrival of cotton is very limited keeping the prices firm. As per the statistics available with the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), the arrival of raw cotton till January 26 is less by about 17% as compared to arrivals during same period of previous year. 

 Traders, ginners claim that the arrivals are restricted due to hoarding capacity of farmers. “Equipped with latest market information, the big farmers are releasing cotton in the market in a staggered manner,” said LV Loyalka, in-charge, operations, Central India, Olam Agro India. 

 Along with the big farmers/traders, ginners are also holding on to a big quantity of cotton expecting expecting the prices to move upward in the days to come. Pradip Jain, president, Khandesh Gin-Press Association said, “At the current prices of raw cotton, it is not affordable for ginners to sell cotton bales.” 

 However, there are mixed estimates about the cotton prices. As per one view, the cotton prices are likely to come under pressure from mid-February as the buying by mills declines due to financial year-ending procedures. While, prices are also expected to increase due to lesser carry forward stocks. “The prices are also expected to increase further from April due to ‘hands to mouth’ situation of Indian spinning mills,” said Rajpal.

 The Sensex has shed over 450 points in 2014 so far, making it the second worst New Year show in nearly two decades, but the leading foreign brokerage is hopeful of Indian equities touching new peaks in coming months. 

 ""Year 2014 will herald the beginning of a bull market in the country and we are setting the Sensex target at 24,000 and an imputed Nifty target of 7,148, implying an upside of 16 per cent from the current levels. 

 ""The Sensex would trade at a PE of 15.9 times which is broadly in line with the past five-year average,"" Deutsche Equities India Research Head Abhay Laijawala told reporters. 

 Although the domestic economy has bottomed out, a recovery is likely to be gradual, showing a perceptible improvement only in the second half of the next fiscal, once the private sector investment cycle starts to revive, he said. 

 ""While we are convinced that economic growth and earnings cycle have bottomed out, the pace of recovery will be crucially determined by the outcome of the national elections, which may form the fulcrum for investor sentiment. 

 ""For equity markets, the 2014 outlook will hence hinge on the ability of either of the two national parties (BJP and Congress) to anchor a stable coalition. We think whoever gets at least 180 seats may form a coalition Government,"" he said. 

 The year is likely to see many an inflection point for the country and its equity market, Laijawala said, as he sees domestic investor disenchantment with equities ebbing. 

 A subdued outlook for oil and gold prices further sweeten the investment thesis, he said. 

 On sectoral picks, he said ""our biggest ""overweights"" are IT services and banks with consumer staples being our largest ""underweight"". 

 On the risks to economic growth, Laijawala said the biggest threat comes from an unfavourable election outcome leading to a fragmented coalition Government. On the external front, any sign of a faster-than-anticipated tightening by the US Fed will be a source of investor concern.

Discom loan recast to power up shares of PSU banks,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/discom-loan-recast-to-power-up-shares-of-psu-banks/articleshow/49264933.cms,m.economictimes.com,Discom loan recast to power up shares of PSU banks,"MUMBAI: Shares of state-owned banks such as Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India and others that have underperformed the market so far this year may get rerated if the government clears the plan to restructure Rs 4.3 lakh crore loans of nine state power distribution companies. 

 Analysts said if the plan is approved, PSU banks will be able to upgrade these loans to standard category, which will bring down risk weightage to 20 per cent from current risk weight of 125 per cent. 

 Lowering of the minimum risk weight means banks will have to set aside less capital for the sector, leading to availability of more funds for lending to other segments. ""PSU banks and infrastructure lenders may get rerated if the government considers loan restructuring of state power distribution companies, along with power sector reforms, including tariff hikes,"" said PVK Mohan, head – equity and senior fund manager at Principal PNB Asset Management Company. 

 Government-owned infra-lenders like REC and PFC will also benefit if the debt restructuring proposal is approved. Indian banking system’s exposure to power sector is estimated at Rs 5.8 lakh crore, or 8.7 per cent of the total bank credit as of August-end. Most state electricity boards’ loan exposure is on the books of PSU banks, said analysts. 

 ""Restructuring loans of discoms is positive for state owned banks and bank ing system as issues regarding non-performing loans will get addressed,"" said Sampath Reddy, chief investment officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance. 

 About 8 per cent of Canara Bank and Central Bank of India’s loan expsoure are to SEBs. Allahabad Bank has 7 per cent, Syndicate Bank has 6 per cent, Bank of India has 4 per cent and Punjab National Bank has 3 per cent loan exposure to SEBs. 

 Shares of state-owned banks have underperformed the markets significantly this year so far. Oriental Bank of Commerce has plunged 58 per cent year to date, Bank of India has dropped 53 per cent, United Bank of India has declined 53 per cent, while UCO Bank has fallen 45 per cent, underperforming the BSE Bankex Index, which has dropped only 6.25 per cent this year so far. 

 ""Shares of PSU banks that have seen some investor interest on news that the government may recast loans of state power distribution companies may get rerated if the proposal is approved,"" said P Phani Sekhar, fund manager PMS, Karvy Stock Broking. 

 Private sector banks do not have direct exposure to state electricity boards but could benefit from the implementation of these reforms.

  One should start with a longer term chart here because that has been sideways for practically 2 years. It is the upper end of it. That is of interest now because we are getting closer to that, is about Rs 285. So that is the breakout, long way to go from here but overall, now if we move to the short or medium term, this is a safe distance of those February lows which is the benchmark I am using. 
  
  In fact it is about 20-25% above it. So short to medium term certainly looks quite healthy and results would give it a boost but longer term, you have got to see now whether if somebody buys it now, hoping for that breakout. 285 is where they should see if it gets past or not and keep a very tight trailing stop there.

 The stock is likely to benefit with the sale of tractors on the back of good monsoon and as investors turn attention to auto sector on hopes of pick-up in demand. 

 “Escorts reported 4QFY13 results well above our expectations largely led by good performance in the tractor business,” said Kotak Securities - Private Client Research report. 

 The revenues during the quarter improved by 15 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 9,442 million. 

 “The growth came primarily on account of 15 per cent tractor volume growth. EBITDA margin improved from 5.7 per cent in 4QFY12 to 6.8 per cent. PAT increased significantly from Rs 189 million in 4QFY12 to Rs 436 million during the quarter,” said Kotak Securities - Private Client Research report.

By Ashutosh Shyam
 
 For about two years, tractor maker Escorts had been struggling with a sliding market share and margin pressure. But the company did a course correction, tweaked a few things around, and is getting back on track.
 
 In order to improve its earnings profile, Escorts is now redefining market share by focusing on higher-priced products and vacating lower-margin ones completely. It is also taking a series of steps to prune cost, align company’s parameters with that of the industry, and carve out a pan-India presence for itself. It has exited low-margin business of tractors up to 30 HP (horse power) and concentrated on the higher margin segment between 30 HP and 60 HP, and plans to top the 50 HP-plus segment.
 
 The changes are paying off. The margins from the tractor vertical have risen to 10% from 4.5% in the past two years. With better financials, its stock, too, has gained 81% in the past year compared with BSE Auto index’s 6%. Tractor sales constitute 80% of Escorts’ earnings while the rest comes from auto ancillary, railway braking and construction equipment.
 
 “Our approach is to set a new competition benchmark in the tractor segment. We perceive John Deere as our main competitor rather than market leader M&M,” said S Sridhar, CEO, agri machinery division, Escorts.
 
 On the operational aspect, the company is tackling each segment -- between 30HP and 60 HP -- to drive volume growth. In the 30-40 HP segment, which constitutes 35% of volume, it has launched Euro series tractor which provides more power and mileage.
 
 Escorts expects the Euro series sales to touch 2,500 units by the next quarter, with the potential to reach 4,000 units. The possible addition of the Euro series has been delayed by 75 days as quality upgradation to European standards took time.
 
 Among the eight products upgrade, five are already done and three are expected in the next six months. But the company’s real challenges lie in the 40-50 HP segment, which constitutes nearly 50% of industry sales. Historically, Escorts enjoyed a market share of 20% in this segment, but slipped to 16% because of its limited presence in the southern/western markets.
 
 Escorts is taking corrective measures to change this situation. It is raising its dealership to 900 from 750 currently, out of which 50% are likely to be in the southern/western region. “Our aim is to capture 6% market share next year in southern/western India, and take it to 10-12% in the next five years,” said S Sridhar, CEO, agri machinery division, Escorts.
 
 The company’s experiment of focusing on higher HP tractor category has started delivering results in the over-50 HP category, where it aims to attain leadership position.
 
 The market share in the 50-HP segment increased to 6% in the December 2013 quarter from 1.5% in FY11. Now, the company is targeting a market share of 8-10% next year and 20% in the next three years. Escorts expects margins from tractor vertical to touch 15% in the next three years from the 10% at present on the back of better product mix and cost rationalisation.
 
 On the cost side, employee count has been reduced to 300 in the past two years and the company is planning to further reduce another 200 in the next two years.

 1. A relatively low vehicle penetration level. India has an average of 13 cars for per 1,000 persons, against 158 in Brazil.
 
 2. Past data shows that the auto sector can grow as much as three times the GDP rate when growth crosses 6%.
 
 3. Auto companies usually have debt-free balance sheets.
 
 4. Auto companies have higher dividend payouts. (Companies like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have had average dividend payouts of 57% and 47% in the past three years.

  At its peak, a quintal of ‘finger’ turmeric sold at Rs 15,800 and certain varieties like ‘Salem finger’ touched Rs 16,676 per quintal in Erode market, the second largest turmeric market in Asia, next to Sangli in Maharashtra. At present, the prices are hovering between Rs 15,300 and Rs 15,400. Around 20 to 40 quintal can be cultivated on one acre depending on the quality of yield. The literally nil carryover stocks due to a low output in 2009, average yield and rising global demand are said to be the reasons for soaring prices.
  
  Flush with money, farmers have enrolled their children for engineering studies and renovated their old houses. “We have almost repaid our debts with just one harvest of turmeric last year. With this year’s harvest, we expect to complete repayment of our debts and start saving for the future,” said a farmer in Kodumudi village in Erode. Kodumudi village is a major turmeric growing belt in the district. Nearly one lakh bags (each bag of 75 kg) of turmeric reaches the Erode market from this village alone. Turmeric is usually sown from May till August and harvested from January.
  
  On an average, the region comprising Erode, Bhavani, Salem, Attur and even Chamarajanagar in Karnataka contributes around 15-20 lakh bags to the country’s annual requirement of 40-45 lakh bags. In 2009, around 12 lakh bags were produced in this region. The crop area decreased in 2009 due to low price realisation in the previous year and also because of difficulty in cultivating the crop. While farmers reduced the acreage to 9,000 hectares in Erode region in 2008-09, they increased it by 15% for the current season.
  
   48-year-old farmer ES Sivanantham of Ennamangalam village in Bhavani Taluk sold 100 quintal at Rs 15,000/ quintal 10 days ago and since his family members laboured in the fields, he has reaped a profit of Rs 10 lakh. In January 2009, he sold the commodity at Rs 3,850 per quintal at a loss.
  
  Following the rise in prices, farmers have also increased the acreage of sowing from four acres to six acres this year. What if prices crash? He is not overly bothered. “It will be difficult but as farmers we have to take the risk,” he added.
  
  But a few framers like VP Krishnamurthy of Arasampattu village in Vellore district believe prices will not go below Rs 10,000 per quintal in the near future. He is hoping for the prices to hit Rs 16,000 to Rs 17,000 per quintal this year. He has around 80 quintals of turmeric in hand. The cost of turmeric cultivation per acre is around Rs 1.5 lakh with seed alone accounting for Rs 50,000 per acre. 
  
  The NAIP’s domestic and export market intelligence cell national consultant Dr N Raveendran said turmeric hits a peak once in every five years.

Favour private sector banks in the banking space: Deven Choksy,positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/favour-private-sector-banks-in-the-banking-space-deven-choksy/articleshow/50267758.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Favour private sector banks in the banking space: Deven Choksy,"In a chat with ET Now, Deven Choksey, MD, KRChoksey Investment Managers, shares his view on Essar Oil delisting. 

 
ET Now: From among the banks, anything else that you like, I mean specifically to IDBI Bank there has been news flow but other than that anything from the mid tier space especially that draws your fancy. 

 
Deven Choksey: Not much. I think among the mid-sized banks one is still not fully convinced that one should add them into portfolio given the variety of challenges that many of them are facing at this point of time. I would still think that the larger size banks would be relatively better off and certainly, the preference would go within the public sector space company like SBI where the downside risk is definitely protected because of the valuation at which the bank is quoting currently. 

 Given, the fact, that higher amount of growth is possible, that we are seeing the new marginal rate of lending coming up, given the fact that the non-performing related assets pressure is coming down and also the fact that many of its subsidiary companies are likely to get unlocking of valuations going forward. 

 I would think that this company would remain relatively a safer bet to add into the portfolio given the kind of potential from the banking space that we are seeing. Otherwise, some of the private sector banks remain really favourite because there the business model is more predictable and at the same time less surprises are their as far as the outcomes are concerned on different aspects of the business. So from that perspective, one would like to keep a mix of few stocks in this portfolio from the banking space and that too on very selective basis.

But certainly we see traction from this festive season particularly happening for the automobile industry, passenger car vehicle segment as well as two wheeler segment. In the second half, we are likely to see the growth coming up for the commercial vehicle segment.  	The quality automobile ancillaries which are having the large-sized customers and growth programme, is decided. To my mind, they would probably be the one who would get the maximum advantage out of it. Subros, the typical ancillary to Maruti and Hyundai, is likely to see a larger amount of growth coming up. "
Festive time: Jewellery makers rally upto 48% ahead of Diwali,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/festive-time-jewellery-makers-rally-upto-48-ahead-of-diwali/articleshow/43217619.cms,m.economictimes.com,Festive time: Jewellery makers rally upto 48% ahead of Diwali,"MUMBAI: The festive season is round the corner and the limelight has shifted onto jewellery companies. Most counters have rallied between 5 and 20 per cent in the past couple of sessions on the hopes of a pick-up in demand ahead of Diwali and the marriage season.
 
 Another reason for increased demand for jewellery counters is the decline in gold prices. The yellow metal has been on a decline on the back of a firm US dollar. The demand for gold has picked up in India after a gap of almost five months.
 
 Jewellers are rushing in to re-stock gold as the price fell to Rs 26,500 per 10 gm last week from Rs 29,000 in early April, in line with international markets. Experts say import of the metal will rise in September and may touch 55 tonne compared with 47 tonne in August. Jewellers are witnessing increase in sales and footfalls, and these are expected to increase as Dhanteras nears.
 
 ""Selected jewellery companies have started to perform following correction in gold price, which is hovering near Rs 26,500 per 10 grams. Gold has multiple supports near Rs 25,000-25,500,"" said Chandan Taparia, Derivatives and Technical Analyst – Equity Research, Anand Rathi.
 
 ""The next major trigger of demand in jewellery stocks is the upcoming festive season. As per industry experts, change in import duty, news of China to add gold in their reserves may be the reasons to give sentimental boost to these stocks,"" Taparia added.
 
 
  
Following are Taparia’s view on jewellery stocks:
 
 
Titan Company: The stock has been making higher highs - higher lows formation on monthly chart and had a strong run up from Rs 202 to Rs 402 levels in just nine months.
 
 It is in a bull run and is witnessing higher trading volumes. Fresh deliveries are seen as participants are expecting its up-move to continue in the coming weeks.
 As per its monthly chart, till it doesn’t go below Rs 363, the strength will remain intact in the stock and any decline would be utilized as a fresh buying opportunity.
 
 The stock is trading at life-time highs and is in an uncharted territory. If it holds above Rs 400, then the levels of 440-450, which is 10 per cent upside from current levels, can be expected.
 
 The stock is highly liquid. Being a part of the NSE F&O segment, options are also active. Conservative traders can ride the rally by trading in Rs 410 or 420 strike of October series.
 
 
TBZ: It was in a downtrend for the last two months and witnessed a decline from Rs 225 to Rs 137 levels. Recently, it has made its bottom formation in the Rs 140-150 zone and started to perform in line with the buying interest in all other jewellery stocks.
 
 In the last two trading sessions, it has seen the highest trading volumes of the year and also crossed & closed above its immediate hurdle of Rs 175 zones.
 If it manages to hold above Rs 175, then this rally can extend to the recent high of Rs 200 and Rs 225 levels. Now Rs 150 zone would act as a major support on declines.
 
 
PC Jeweller: The stock listed at Rs 137 in the month of December 2012 and has now doubled up. It is heading to higher territory as it is making higher top and higher bottom formation on daily, weekly and monthly charts.
 
 On Monday it moved 20 per cent with a significant jump in trading volumes. It has now major support at Rs 220 and on upside now the sky is the limit as it is heading to uncharted territory with better trading flows.
 
 
Rajesh Exports: The stock had a dream run between March and June. It moved up from Rs 75 to Rs 200 levels. It later declined from Rs 200 to Rs 135 and is now forming a base near Rs 140 zones. Still momentum is missing compared to peers.
 
 It has immediate hurdle at Rs 165 and above that bulls may take the stock towards Rs 180 levels. It has major support at Rs 140.
 
 
Gitanjli Gems: The stock witnessed a big crack in 2013 when it fell down from Rs 650 to Rs 48 levels. Traders are stuck on the counter and so supply keeps coming in on every small bounce back.
 
 The trend is negative, but on short-term basis it is making support base around the Rs 63-65 zone. Traders are running to average down their past holding. It has immediate support at Rs 62.50.

ET Now: Force Motors’s management commentary per se has been about cautious optimism ahead of the June quarter numbers, It is true that the company is doing work for two premier MNC car makers and that should augur well for it, but what has driven the stellar move that has happened on the counter, up 30 per cent for the week? Is the market pre-empting an extremely strong quarter? 
 
 
Daljeet Singh Kohli: I would say that the upmove has not been exactly due to likely strong quarterly numbers.
 
 It is a very good-quality company that is available to you right now and that at no obscene valuations, in case you compare it with say Eicher or MRF or anything.
 
 So people are expecting that this company will ultimately be in that league.
 
 For example, at Rs 5,000, Bosch used to look like highly overpriced. But people are still buying the stock. So, Force Motors is a similar kind of story.
 
 If you remember, at Rs 550 seven-eight months back, we had recommended it in one of our trading calls. At that time, Rs 850 was our target price. We had thought that it will probably run up. But the stock ran up too fast. We then increased out target price for the stock to Rs 1,300. But the story since then has been the same.
 
 This company is going to scale up its business to a large extent which is right now in very few numbers, which will become into five-digit numbers. The company is talking of a total to 20,000 engines, and then increasing it to 50,000.
 
 This will mean that this company can multi-fold in size in next three to five years. All this will be done with very high quality of management.
 
 We have never heard anything from that. This is the quality being chased and the expectation that this can be another multibagger like Bosch or Eicher. So those who are holding up the stock should not even think of anything. They should just stick to it. Those who have not bought it will feel that they have been left out at every given price. So, we will rather say that if you have to have it in your portfolio, you should take that plunge, so you should buy.

  Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan, in a chat with ET Now talks about the FII inflows. 
  
  
  Some time back we were just wondering that this kind of foreign money in a capital scarce economy is good because once it finally starts getting into real estate and infra are they really do get a very big business boost. How significant could it be if we continue with these flows? Some of these real estate and infras companies have no shortage of orders. The real problem is easy money. Do you think that could be the significant big up move next?
   
  Absolutely, I think at the moment what we are witnessing is a combination of a very strong revival in our domestic economy and it looks like it will continue for next 2-3 years - the fund raising and access to money particularly by the smaller companies which was a constraint particularly after 2008 debacle and the entire private sector funding actually had come to a standstill. Now there is strong revival there and companies are able to raise money both through domestic market - seen in the IPO market and from foreigners. 
  
  So because of this kind of money being available - particularly to companies in the infrastructure space, real estate and whole host of other sectors - definitely it would be a big positive. The only risk that people were looking at was the interest rates going up and we think that we could see 25 to 50 basis point hike but that should not be a major constraint. So that’s a very big positive development for our markets.

Forward Markets Commission unveils uniform norms for accreditation of warehouses,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/forward-markets-commission-unveils-uniform-norms-for-accreditation-of-warehouses/articleshow/41085959.cms,m.economictimes.com,Forward Markets Commission unveils uniform norms for accreditation of warehouses,"NEW DELHI: To strengthen warehousing facilities in the commodity futures market, regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has come out with uniform norms for the accreditation of warehousing service providers.
 
 The draft rules, on which public comments have been sought by September 15, come in the wake of Rs 5,600 crore payment scam at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) that surfaced in July last year, exposing loopholes in the system.
 
 The proposed changes are being made because at present no uniform norms are being followed by national level commodity exchanges for accreditation of warehousing service providers (WSPs).
 
 ""In order to ensure uniformity at all national commodity exchanges, the Commission has decided that the norms regarding Ownership, Net worth, Corporate Governance etc for WSPs for accreditation with the National Multi-Commodity Exchanges (NMCEs) shall be as follow..."" FMC said.
 
 As per the draft rules, a WSP should have a minimum net worth of Rs 5 crore for providing warehousing services for single commodity and Rs 10 crore for multiple commodities.
 
 The promoter of the WSP should be in the warehousing business for at least three years. He should be of ""repute"" and have ""credible market standing"".
 
 WSPs should furnish security deposit of about two per cent for the value less than or equal to Rs 250 crore of the goods stored in the warehouses, three per cent for the value of Rs 250-500 crore and five per cent for above the value of Rs 500 crore of goods.
 
 ""A daily monitoring of the security deposits vis-a-vis the value of the commodity stored needs to be done so as to ensure that the minimum stipulated security deposits is always maintained with the exchange,"" FMC said.
 
 It is necessary that WSPs should be adequately capitalised to carry on the activity in compliance with all conditions as may be prescribed from time to time, it said.
 
 The exchange may ask for additional security deposit like bank guarantee from approved bank, fixed deposit receipt, cash or other forms of liquid security deposit as may be deemed acceptable by exchange, it added.
 
 On corporate governance norms, FMC said that a WSP should preferably be a corporate body with a professional management team.
 
 ""The WSP should ensure that the ownership and management is separate and an arm's length relationship is maintained with promoter/promoter group entities/relatives of the promoters, and the major suppliers and major customers of these entities,"" the FMC said.
 
 The WSP should set up a number of committees to oversee its operations as may be prescribed by the exchange subject to the condition that there should always be an audit committee of the WSP comprising of independent professionals.
 According to the draft rules, a WSP should have a 'Customer Grievances Cell' to handle customer complaints and should take proactive steps to resolve customer related issues. 

 The exchanges should have a 'Know Your Depositor Policy' which needs to be complied with by a WSP. 

 FMC also said that the WSP should ensure that there is no direct conflict of interest with the interests of the exchange and the depositors/lawful owners of goods. 

 ""WSPs/owners/relatives shall not be allowed to trade on any Exchange. For this purpose, the definition of 'relative' shall be as provided under the Companies Act, 2013,"" it said. 

 For accreditation purpose, a WSP should have sound facilities and infrastructure to store commodities. It should have insurance cover for stored commodities and comply with the provisions of the exchange's rules, regulations and by-laws, besides various central and state laws. 

 ""The exchanges are directed to ensure compliance of the above norms while accrediting the WSPs,"" the FMC said.

The private sector lender’s chairperson hinted at a possibility of an interest rate reduction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Net profit in the June quarter climbed to Rs 2,695.7 crore, missing analysts estimates of 22% rise to Rs 2,721 crore. Its shares fell 1.5% to Rs 1,098.6 on the BSE.
 
 Net interest income — difference between cost of deposits and yield on advances — rose 23.5% to Rs 6,388.8 crore. ""Although the net profit is lower than expected, the overall quality of the bank remains intact. Net profit was lower due to specific provisions — such as floating provisions (Rs 65 crore) — that the bank made this year,” said Hatim Broachwala, a banking analyst from Nirmal Bang. The net interest margin, a measure of its profitability, reremained stable at 4.3%.
 
 
""There could be a possibility, albeit limited, of further rate reductions,"" chairperson Shyamala Gopinath, a former central bank deputy governor, told shareholders at the 21st annual general meeting. The Reserve Bank is set to announce its next monetary policy on August 4.
 
 The bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPA), or net bad loans — loans where customers failed to pay in time — rose to Rs 3,652 crore from Rs 3,356 crore. After making provisions of Rs 728 crore, the net NPA as a percentage of total loans remained stable at 0.27%. The provisions for bad loans were at Rs 482 crore in quarter ending June last year. ""The provision is not for any specific account,"" said Aditya Puri, chief executive of the bank. ""They are floating provisions which can be reversed. The slippages have come from agriculture and SME.""
 
 The treasury business, which lost money last year in June quarter, posted a pre-tax profit of Rs 253.7 crore against a loss of Rs 53 crore. Corporate segment’s pre-tax earnings rose 19% to Rs 2,143 crore The bank’s loans rose 22% to Rs 3.8 lakh crore while deposits rose 30% to Rs 4.8 lakh crore. The share of low-cost deposits — which is current and savings account — fell to 39.6% from 43% a year ago. The business environment appears to be improving, said Gopinath. ""Some traction in government-led infrastructure investments, partly by re-starting stalled projects could help turnaround domestic credit growth,"" said Gopinath.

Hot Stock: Brokerages expect sharp gains in Larsen & Toubro,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hot-stock-brokerages-expect-sharp-gains-in-larsen-toubro/articleshow/19358601.cms,m.economictimes.com,Hot Stock: Brokerages expect sharp gains in Larsen & Toubro,"MUMBAI: Infrastructure major Larsen & Toubro has become a blue-eyed stock-pick of brokerages. JP Morgan has upgraded its rating on the stock to 'overweight'. Last month, CLSA and Goldman Sachs also had upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ following its underperformance and hopes of pick-up in orders from the middle-east. 

 Not disappointing the brokerages, the company has been lately bagging big orders. After bagging Rs 5,689-crore EPC contract for Supercritical Power Plant in Rajasthan, the company’s construction arm secured AED 943.11 million Abu Dhabi Airport order today. L&T Construction also bagged orders worth Rs 3,700 crore in March, 2013. 

 According to JP Morgan, the company has managed to surprise with order inflow in weak environment. It is best positioned to benefit from capex revival and is well geared to tap the international opportunity. The brokerage has a price target of Rs 1,650 on the stock. 

 “L&T has been pre-qualified for several large projects in the middle-east transportation sector. The opportunities include Doha metro, Riyadh metro and freight corridor for Etihad rail. Financial bids for some packages have already been submitted. L&T has also been pre-qualified for a large road order in Muscat. We have built in a 25 per cent Y-o-Y growth in international orders for FY14 to Rs 187 billion,” the CLSA report had said. 

 It sees the stock hitting 1,750 in next 12-months. 

 Goldman Sachs sees limited downside risk in the stock making it risk-reward favorable on the basis of a robust order book (over 2X forward revenue coverage) providing revenue visibility and a declining interest rate regime. It has a target price of Rs 1,710 on L&T. 

 “If we strip out other businesses from the current price, the standalone business appears to be trading at a 1-yr forward P/E of 12.1X (ex- subs dividends), which is at a significant discount to its 3-year historical valuation of 20X. We believe this is attractive as we expect the company to generate a standalone ROIC of 22 per cent in FY14E,” it added. 

 The recent movement in the stock price has also made technical analysts to take a bullish trading call on the stock. 

 “On a short term basis, the stock RSI (14) is giving a divergence along with an exit from oversold region indicating stronger price moves to the upside. The stock has held its Rs 1,309 levels over the last 9 months and is expected to see commited demand at current price level. L&T has seen some long buildup along with possibility of shorts exiting the counter as per options data,” said Sahil Kapoor, analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services. 

 He has advised traders to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,420, keeping a stop loss below Rs 1,330 for a target of Rs 1,560. 

 Manav Chopra, Technical Analyst, Nirmbal Bang sees the stock touching a target of Rs 1,525-1,540 in next 2-3 weeks. 

 “The stock has been in a rising channel pattern since December’11 and the recent decline has taken support at the lower end of the channel. The RSI has declined near the support range and has formed a probable double bottom pattern which has been confirmed by an uptick in the indicator. There is also a probable double bottom pattern on daily price chart and positive divergence in RSI which is a positive signal and indicates an upside in the near term,” he said. 

 At 12:50 p.m.; the stock was at Rs 1,413, down 0.62 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 1,427 and a low of Rs 1,405.60 in trade today.

ET Now: Within NBFCs what is the clutch of stocks that you like the most?  

 
Ajay Bagga: Look at when the commercial vehicle cycle is going to turn this year. You can look at financials of that and then housing finance. Housing finance is no brainer.There is a huge growth you are seeing. Managements come out with guidance of 20-25% growth that they are anticipating. In the NBFC segment these two can be looked at. 

 
ET Now: Would you bet on the tried and tested like Gruh Finance etc. which are trading at premium valuations? Or would you go in for the ones which have not moved at all, say GIC or even LIC Housing Finance? The Can Fin Homes etc have not really moved as much as a Gruh Finance or an HDFC have moved?  

 
Ajay Bagga: You can look at either of those sections. Overall housing finance NBFC should do well. The market leaders of course stay at the top. But there are people who are able to lent to affordable segments so look at the distribution strength and even smaller companies can be looked at.

Indians on spending spree: Time to nibble at discretionary stocks,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indians-on-spending-spree-time-to-nibble-at-discretionary-stocks/articleshow/49192923.cms,m.economictimes.com,Indians on spending spree: Time to nibble at discretionary stocks,"NEW DELHI: Amid confusing signs on the health of the domestic economy, September auto sales data sent out a bold signal: Indians want to spend more.
 
 Two-wheeler volumes barely grew in the pre-festive month, but Royal Enfield maker Eicher Motors posted 59 per cent year-on-year growth, selling 44,491 units against 28,020 units sold a year ago. Enfield models with up to 350cc engine capacity grew 63 per cent to 40,280 units from 24,662, while models with more than 350cc engine capacity sold 25 per cent more at 4211 units against 3358 units a year ago.
 
 India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki reported better volume growth in Ciaz hybrid and S-Cross than in the mini-car and compact car segments. Hyundai saw better volume growth in i20 and Creta than other models. Honda sold more units of Amaze and City than Brio or Jazz.
 
 The fineprint: the discretionary part of the consumption story is beginning to gain traction. The middle class Indian is finally loosening his purse strings, growing more confident and comfortable as he has about income growth, job security and falling inflation. So, he wants to spend more, eat out more and travel more.
 
 With inflation on a steady decline, consumer confidence in the economy seems to have risen gradually following a series of adrenalin-boosting steps by the new government and the recent rate cut by the RBI.
 
 That should be a good reason for stock investors to start nibbling at the consumer discretionary basket, which earlier this week got a shot in the arm after the Reserve Bank of India cut the repo rate by a more-than-expected 50 basis points.
 
 RBI governor Raghuram Rajan was pretty candid about the fact that the central bank now wants to push consumption, which he said would be the only growth driver in the domestic economy in an environment of global economic slowdown, monetary tightening and currency headwinds.
 
 Rajan also said the forthcoming pay commission award, which is likely to come towards the end of the year and take effect from the first quarter of the next financial year, should work as a stimulus for the economy -- another signal that the central bank and policymakers are now betting on consumption to drive the early phase of revival in the domestic economy.
 
 Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO of Envision Capital, roots for the aspirational business theme. ""I think consumer discretionary is in a sweet spot,” he said. Shah likes Mahindra Holidays and the airlines stocks. “To us, even real estate is a consumer discretionary. If you have a real estate developer who is basically building residences and quality homes for middle income households, that is consumer discretionary for us.
 
 The second is something like Mahindra Holidays. The last two-three years have not been particularly good for the sector. I think the way we look at it, every Indian household who buys a car would potentially wants to go on a holiday,"" he told ET Now.
 
 Consumer discretionary comprises businesses that deal with products or services that are not necessities, and hence, linked mainly to urban consumers. A little risk exists here, though. Some astute investors figured out this opportunity quite early and have driven up many of these stocks such as Jubilant Foodworks, Page Industries to expensive levels. So investors need to be discrete here.
 
 ""Clearly, urban consumption is looking quite good because if you look at the three things happened to urban consumption, one clearly the lower inflation is helping them, more money has been saved in the pocket of consumer, lower fuel prices are actually helping them,"" says Vikram Kotak, Crest Capital and Investment.
 
 Ajay Tyagi, EVP and Fund Manager of UTI Mutual Fund, says the conditions are just right for discretionary spending and capital formation in the economy.
 
 ""All this while, we were waiting for inflation to cool down and cool off and consequently interest rates to come down. With both these things now becoming increasingly imminent I think that discretionary spending and capital formation should start sometime in the very near future and that should actually augur well for earnings growth,"" he told ET Now.
 
 ""There is a revival of confidence in a few sectors which are helping urban consumption to pick up. Rural consumption is a little down, but urban consumption remains a good theme, which you buy through an auto or you buy through discretionary or you buy through the white goods,"" Crest Capital’s Kotak told ET Now.
 
 Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President of Sharekhan, likes INOX Leisure, Satyam Multiplexes and Pantalook Fashion. ""We think they fit into our overall theme of urban discretionary consumption, which is a bet one can really look at. The other big choice is Pantaloon Fashion and Retail. ""We think there is going to be a merger of that into Aditya Birla Fashions by December and that company would be renamed and listed again in December and there is going to be a good unlocking of value there as well.""

ET Now: Not a table thumping number but clearly much above what the street or most bullish analyst were betting on? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: 2990 is a huge beat given the sentiments surrounding that stock. It is way beyond street estimates as far as the Q4 numbers were concerned.
 
 
ET Now: 2990 prima facie the numbers were looking strong, we do not have details on whether it is a tax ride back or whether it is a forex gain? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: I do not think you are going to see a major variation in the margins because not too much of a volume growth would have happened in the fourth quarter. We have to see the margin picture what sort of a forex gain or loss has come in and what sort of a taxation rate have they applied so all these details would be important.
 
 
ET Now: The FY15 guidance is out 7 per cent to 9 per cent, this is the most important number, it is not way out of what analyst were expecting but 7 per cent to 9 per cent is not bad but in line with the most optimistic estimate for FY15? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: They have managed to hold on to the expectation of brokerages' estimates so if they are between 7 per cent to 9 per cent the stock would not react negatively.
 
 
ET Now: NASSCOM has indicated that they expect the Indian IT industry to grow at a run rate of about 12 per cent to 14 per cent, Infosys has given a guidance of 7 per cent to 9 per cent so Infosys clearly has indicated that they would grow at a run rate which is lower than the industry average why should anybody be happy that is a bad news? 
 
 
Manish Sonthalia: They have a lot of restructuring to do, they are rationalising costs, you may want to sell the stock now and buy when the company has got restructured and then jump into the stock because it is a quality name. But whether you want to live through this or not depends upon your understanding about the company and what they have been doing.
 
 They are doing all the right things now, the leadership has been revamped, they would be working on sales effectiveness and delivery productivity. In the next two years hopefully this is the bottom part of the growth that you would be seeing in Infosys. Post restructuring may be this stock will really pick up and this company will get revamped which they have missed out and where TCS has scored.
 
 
ET Now: Infosys has some specific issues. At a time when HCL Tech, TCS or Tech Mahindra are growing at a run rate which is much higher than the industry average, why settle for Infosys where we know the path is going to be volatile? 

 
Manish Sonthalia: Dividend payout ratio has a very big bearing on PE multiples. If we are looking at a 40% payout ratio given that dividend yield of the market as a whole always remain between 1.5% and 2%, 15-16 prices to earning multiple is not expensive. We are looking at the bottom end of the valuation range for Infosys where things are only going to look up. 

 The stock prices do not move looking at the past, they move looking into the future and things are going to improve for Infosys and growth is going to converge towards TCS as far as 2016 is concerned.

"Invetsors, asset managers keep faith in Nestle despite Maggi row",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/invetsors-asset-managers-keep-faith-in-nestle-despite-maggi-row/articleshow/48291403.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Invetsors, asset managers keep faith in Nestle despite Maggi row","Asset managers, insurers and foreign institutions have been either holding on to their stakes or buying shares of Nestle even as the market capitalisation of the FMCG major, hounded by India's food regulator, fell Rs 15,000 crore between end May and early June. 

 Large investors such as LIC, Arisaig Singapore, Aberdeen and Commonwealth Bank of Australia - whose combined holding in the company is 6.58 per cent -refrained from selling shares amid brokers lowering earnings forecast and the market fearing a setback for the brand. 

 Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, has increased stake fivefold to 98,606 shares from 18,176 shares, ac cording to Bloomberg data. Local institutions such Axis and Bajaj Allianz also increased holding in the stock. 

 A closer look at trading data shows that between mid that between midMay and mid-June trading of Nestle India stock intensified. There was unusual volatility and hectic intraday trading during that period when average delivery of shares dropped to less than 40 per cent compared with 80 per cent in the past one year while number of trades surged 10 fold. 

 There are fundamental as wel as technical reasons for owning Nestle shares. “Nestle offers sharp brand positioning, strong urban distribution and exceptional supply chain. Hence, a sharp fall in share price attracted a lot of long-term in vestors,“ said a domestic fund manager on condition of anonymity. 

 He said that the Maggi controversy would induce the company to reth ink its strategy on margins over volume growth. The volume growth in the past three years came down to 9 per cent as against a historical average of 14 per cent. 'Buy' rating on the stock has increased to 29 per cent in July 2015 as against 19 per cent in January 2015. 

 After the Maggi controversy, Jefferies, a broker, released a `buy' report with a target price of Rs 7,025 while Credit Suisse upgraded its rating on Nestle India to 'neutral' from `underperformer' for the first time since December 2012. Strong business model and fair visibility of earnings valued on discounted cash flow (DCF) backed the outlook. But it's difficult to buy the stock in bulk due to low liquidity and low floating stock. 

 While this raises the impact cost of buying the stock, it's an indicator that there's room for appreciation.

Though the first quarter saw a year-on-year rise of 27% in fuel expenses, and there was an imposition of additional charges at the Delhi Airport, Jet Airways reported a modest net profit of Rs 36 crore after five quarters of loss.
 
 
Sustainable future: The consensus analyst rating has jumped to 3.57 from 2.57 in a month because it is believed that the factors which led the company to put up a good performance in the first quarter will continue. Besides, the continuing problems of Kingfisher Airlines and Air India should help Jet Airways improve its position.
 
 
Internal improvement: The good performance is the result of effort on the part of the management. The repositioning of its no-frills brands—discontinuation of the Jetlite brand and merger with the upscale JetKonnect brand—has helped it generate a 50% yield, which is revenue per passenger km, an improvement for Jetlite. The closure of non-profitable international routes also improved the international load factor by 580 bps (y-o-y). Jet Airway’s efforts to improve ancillary revenues, reduce operating costs through route nationalisation and contract renegotiation are yielding results.
 
 
  
Debt reduction: The management plans to reduce the debt burden by $400-500 million in 2012-13 with the cash generated from operations as well as from the sale and leaseback of aircraft. In 2012-13, it plans to raise $180 million in this way. During the quarter, Jet Airways completed the sale and leaseback of two aircraft, generating Rs 52 crore, and plans to do the same with 8-9 more aircraft in the next couple of quarters.
 
 Given the favourable domestic market environment, analysts feel that a debt reduction of $250-300 million is achievable.
 
 
Exercise caution: The improving fundamentals is expected to result in re-rating. However, investors should not ignore the key risks involved. The current threats include a further increase in ATF prices, with the Brent crude already jumping back to $112 levels, and depreciation in rupee.
 
 
Selection methodology: We pick the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating in the past month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weightages to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell).
 
 Any improvement in consensus rating indicates that the analysts are becoming more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks that have been covered by at least 10 analysts.

The central bank also removes restriction on import of gold coins. 

 In a notification issued on Wednesday, the RBI said, “Nominated banks are now permitted to import gold on consignment basis. All sale of gold domestically will, however, be against upfront payments. Banks are free to grant gold metal loans. 

 Aiming to tame the then widening current account deficit (CAD), the central bank in August 2013 had prohibited imports of gold coins and medallions besides restricting inbound shipments of the metal.

  MUMBAI: JK Paper, India's third-largest paper maker, is exploring options of building a pulp mill in south Asia, that would give the company complete ownership of the raw material vital for making paper. However, the Delhi-based company will look at such an option only after completion of an ongoing expansion at its paper and pulp facilities in India, chief finance officer, V Kumaraswamy, told ET. 
  
  At 10:32 am, shares of JK Paper were trading 0.40% up at Rs 49.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  ""We can look at setting up a pulp mill in Taiwan or Indonesia or the Philippines, and bring the pulp back to India as it's difficult to make pulp here,"" said Mr Kumaraswamy. It would currently cost between 1,000-1,200 crore to build a 200,000-300,000 tonne pulp mill overseas, he added. 
  
  Pulp, the crucial input for making paper and viscose staple fibre, is mostly imported by Indian companies as local laws relating to growing trees for pulp are stringent. 
  
  Companies are not allowed to directly own forests and can only support farmers who will grow the trees under the so-called farm forestry scheme. This has prompted Indian companies such as Ballarpur Industries, India's largest paper making company and the Aditya Birla group, to go overseas for acquiring pulp capacity. 
  
  While JK Paper has some pulp capacity of its own, it is spending 1,653 crore to build a new pulp mill with capacity 215,000 tonnes and expanding paper capacity by 165,000 tonnes.

Ashish Maheshwari: The two stocks that I like are among the top five in the industry where they operate. Both are available at very good price/earnings multiples and have shown consistent performance in past.
 
 Among them, the first is Kwality. It is India's third largest private sector dairy processor after Nestle India and Britannia Industries.
 
 This particular company is already processing 3 million litre milk per day and it already has six processing plants. Recently, company carried out one expansion plan. The plan is going to be operational in this quarter. After this, they are going to make butter, cheese, ghee and flavoured milk from these plants.
 
 With this, like they are also expanding their brand 'Dairy best' in northern Indian market, I am expecting topline to increase by almost Rs 1,000-crore in this particular segment once this plant is commissioned. From there, they are going to cater mainly to the retail side of the market, where the Ebitda margins are pretty high. In past also company has performed consistently. If you see last four years, the topline grew at a CAGR of almost 35 per cent.
 
 The bottomline has been consistently growing at 22 per cent plus. I am expecting that in this particular year, company can report an EPS of almost Rs 10. Going forward, it will be around Rs 12 in FY17, when this plant is operational. The stock is one of the cheapest plays in the dairy sector.

  ET Now: Any trading strategies on Manappuram Finance?
   
  Deepak Mohoni: Interesting stock to hold in a bull market because last bull market it went up 20 fold from end of 2008 to the top in October-November with the rest of the market. Now it has corrected heavily that is the volatility factor coming in fallen more than 50% again making a very strong move so short term definitely no problem here be on the long side whenever you trade it. Long term once it bottoms out or makes a higher intermediate bottom it could be an interesting stock to even have in a portfolio provided that portfolio has got 15-16 other stock as a question because if it even does about half as well as it did last time the returns would be quite enormous really.

Benchmark indices have witnessed their best period in the past 100 days after the NDA government took charge on 26 May, 2014.

Both the Sensex and the Nifty have managed to hit fresh record highs almost on a daily basis. The Sensex conquered the fresh peak of 27,000, while the Nifty breached 8,100 levels in trade on Tuesday.

Tuesday marked the 100th day since Narendra Modi was sworn in as India’s 14th Prime Minister. The S&P BSE Sensex has rallied nearly 9 per cent since then.

Most of the stocks, which have rallied so far in the year 2014, are from economy-linked sectors. So, stocks in auto, consumer durable and capital goods sector have seen major heavy weight buying.

Considering the fact that most of the stocks have already rallied so far in the year 2014, are there any multi-bagger opportunities left in the market? Yes, say analysts.

First, let’s discuss what are multi-baggers. A multi-bagger is a stock where one’s investment appreciates by multiple times. This is the term mostly used to describe those stocks which have the potential to report explosive growth over a period of time.

“Multi-baggers are stocks which give you returns which are multiples of your investment amount. This is a terminology derived from baseball where each base covered is a bag,” said Dr. Vikas Gupta, Executive Vice President, Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd.

“It is something like a ‘run’ in cricket terminology. A home run with 4 bases is equivalent to a ‘sixer’. This was a term coined by Peter Lynch, one of the most amazing fund managers and a big baseball fan,” he added.

What should investors look in a company to know that it could be a multi-bagger in the coming future? According to analysts, investors should avoid taking exposure in penny stocks and companies with inconsistent track record.

Look for companies with stable business models which can generate strong cash flow even in a downturn and should have the potential to perform really well under good economic conditions that one can expect in the next 3-5 years, say analysts.

In general, stocks, which had fundamental issues in the past, could be the potential multi-baggers.

“These kind of stocks could have lower than industry price multiples such as price/earnings, price/sales, etc. PEG ratio could also be a better idea in picking a value based multi-bagger,” said Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services.

“A fundamentally sound under-priced stock would always reflect less than 1.0 PEG ratio, because of continued rise in EPS and slow growth in price. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock might be undervalued given its bottom-line performance,” he added.

We spoke to various analysts and here’s the list of their stocks which could become multi-baggers in the coming years:


				
Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities

Cox & Kings provides a multi-bagger opportunity for long-term investors as the Budget 2014 contained significant announcements for the tourism sector as the government looked set to promote the tourism industry as indicated in its election manifesto.

	 
For instance, e-visas facility will be introduced at 9 major airports, 5 tourist circuits on specific themes will be set up, there would be development of more airports under the PPP mode in tier-II and tier-III cities, there is a Rs 1000-crore outlay for improvement of rail connectivity in North-East, among others.

Raamdeo Agrawal, MD & Co-Founder, MOFSL

Where you have global advantage, it could be either pharma or it could be tech again. So we are bullish on companies like Infosys and TCS. May be Sun Pharma, may be some other company, may be even a telecom company, a Bharti kind of company can become very large in the next 10 years.

Dr. Vikas Gupta, Executive Vice President, Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd

We think currently NMDC, Coal India, Baja Auto, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tata Motors, Hero etc. are some of the multi-baggers. Tata Motors might have high debt but that is in low-interest rate foreign currency and adequately supported by foreign currency earnings. Others are all zero-debt and some are sitting on large amounts of cash, that can be invested in growth opportunities, both organic and inorganic.

Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services

There are certain stocks which have the potential to become multi-baggers, such as Apollo Tyres, Redington India, L&T Finance Holdings, Idea Cellular, etc.

Ambareesh Baliga, Market Expert

Shipping is one sector where we could see a multi-bagger going ahead and when I say a multi-bagger, it could take possibly two to three years; but, that is one space where I think one should look at buying.

Very clearly, if you see the last results, SCI was a clear turnaround story and it is quoting at a discount to its book value. The book value is close to 110.

So this is a stock which one can look at buying at Rs 60. At least in the medium term, we could see levels of about Rs 85 to Rs 88, but then again if you are able to hold on for the next three to four years, it should more than double.

Avinnash Gorakssakar, Head of Research, Mintdirect.com

In the midcap pharma space, we like Indoco Remedies. They had very strong numbers in Q1, plus the kind of visibility the company is talking, they are saying that possibly in the next 12 to 18 months, they should be targeting a top line of close to Rs 1500 crore, which is very-very significant.

My sense is even from the current levels both from the earnings traction point of view and the kind of events, they are working on some molecules. My guess is probably a price target of Rs 325-350 over the next one year.

Dilip Bhat, Joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher

Voltas is one stock which has run up. Over the next three to four years, this stock can certainly be a multibagger from the current levels.

Federal Bank is a stock which probably in three to four years can go up two or three times.

L G Balakrishnan is another stock which is really doing pretty well and though it has had a good run up, it still has sufficient scope to give above average returns.

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: Media is a very large basket I know but the earnings have started to pick up. You look at Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd from the exhibition space or Dish TV India Ltd for that matter from the distribution space and their commentary for the quarter two has sounded off like it is going to be a promising quarter and we also hear ad rates picking up, which would probably augur well for print and television companies too. Are you bullish on the space at large? 

 
Taher Badshah: It is an interesting space to watch out for in 2015, especially if FMCG companies and even auto companies for that matter actually start utilising some of the savings that they have on raw materials towards more ad expenses. We are also probably going to see a lot of sporting events over the course of the year. So that is something which would also augur well from the point of viewership etc. The only challenge of course for these companies is that they are also investing simultaneously in newer properties and channels which probably could lead to margin dislocation in the near term. So that could probably be one of the headwinds which it encounters and it remains a reasonably competitive space altogether. So the next 12 months could probably be better compared to what the previous 12 months could be in terms of the earnings profile.

"Mid-cap pharma stocks can return 20% in 2014, say analysts",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/mid-cap-pharma-stocks-can-return-20-in-2014-say-analysts/articleshow/28336330.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Mid-cap pharma stocks can return 20% in 2014, say analysts","NEW DELHI: Despite headwinds from the USFDA, pharma stocks have been in favour due to the defensive nature of their business, healthy export performance and of course a weaker rupee.

Pharma companies for the second quarter of the financial year 2014 declared a mixed bag results. The recent market rally in the pharma sector has materially reduced the valuation gap that existed between the historical multi-year average valuation multiple and current valuation.

Following the past two quarters of weakness, analysts at top brokerage firms expect some good performance in India as implementation of DPCO 2013 concludes, among other reasons. Elara Capital expects domestic pharma business to rise by 9 per cent for the quarter.

Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD & Co Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, is positive on the entire pharma sector. Although he identifies two set of companies in the pack - one, export-oriented firms like Sun Pharma and the Ciplas of the world and Glenmark and all.

""This is one set of companies which are riding onto the Indian generic revolution all over the world,"" he says. The second set of companies which would ride the wave are domestic pharmas which have very large opportunities, he adds.

Agrawal is of the view that the entire pharma pack, particularly the large ones which have export as well as domestic operations, will see very interesting times.

Elara Capital in a report said that they expect revenues to grow at a robust 20 per cent, driven by continued strong performance by Sun Pharma.

Excluding Sun, revenue growth is expected to remain moderate at 14 per cent.

For the upcoming quarter (October-December), the brokerage firm expects weak earnings for GSK Pharma owing to price cuts and trade union strikes, with pressure on revenue and margin.

Performance for Ranbaxy is likely to be weak in the absence of new launches and pressure in the emerging markets.

However, overall, Elara Capital remains overweight on the pharma sector as the companies are well positioned to take advantage of the global generic opportunity, against the backdrop of a patent cliff and rich ANDA pipeline.

This, coupled with recovery in India, will drive earnings and stock performance. In the near term, Elara Capital expects mid-cap stocks to outperform large-cap peers.

At the current level, Elara Capital believes that large-cap valuations offer limited scope for a strong upside. In the mid-cap space, we like Torrent Pharma and Divi’s Labs. It maintains Dr Reddy’s as its top pick in the large-cap space.

Ipca Laboratories (Ipca), Aurobindo Pharma (Aurobindo), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (Sun) and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (Glenmark) breached their respective three-year and five-year historical average multiples recently on the back of a strong show in the export markets.

On the other hand, players like Dishman Pharma (Dishman), Cadila Healthcare (Cadila), Cipla and Divi's Laboratories (Divi's), which have yet to catch up with their historical average multiples in spite of a healthy growth outlook, can perform relatively better going ahead.

	 
“While the outlook for the overall sector remains strong, we observe players having a presence in niche segments like injectibles, ophthalmic solutions, hormones, nasal spray, sterile solutions, complex products in oncology space, and high-technology new drug delivery systems (NDDS), have yet to gain a premium over players having a presence in vanilla generics like tablets and capsules,” Sharekhan said in a note.

Owing to better growth visibility, the brokerage firm has introduced estimates for FY16 and rolling over valuation to the estimated earnings in case of Aurobindo, Cadila and Divi's.

They have maintained their ‘buy’ recommendation on Aurobindo (with a revised price target of Rs 470) considering the stock is available at a deep discount as against other large-cap players despite having rapidly built up a strong pipeline in a niche space.

Apart from that, Cadila is a strong ‘buy’ (with a revised price target of Rs 988) and also Divi's, with a revised price target of Rs 1,450.

Sharekhan bets on Cadila, Cipla and Divi's as top picks as these are yet to catch up with their respective historical averages due to certain issues, mostly temporary.

Here is a list of 11 stocks along with their target prices for the next one year from Elara Capital:

New launches help Garware Wall Ropes cast its net wider,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/new-launches-help-garware-wall-ropes-cast-its-net-wider/articleshow/34129801.cms,m.economictimes.com,New launches help Garware Wall Ropes cast its net wider,"Garware Wall Ropes is poised to grow faster in the coming years with the growing acceptance of some of its new products in the overseas aquaculture industry as well as in the domestic agriculture market. The company's valuations look attractive, if it can achieve its goals.
 
 ""We expect to grow 15-20% annually over the next three years,"" said Vayu Garware, chairman and managing director of the company. ""Our goal is to reach Rs 1,000 crore turnover in FY17.""
 
 This will be a significant spurt for the company, which grew at an average annualised growth rate of 8% in the past five years and clocked a turnover of Rs 639 crore in the 12-month period ended December 2013. The optimism stems from the popularity of some of its recent launches.
 
 The company is a leading global player in heavy-duty fishing nets for mechanised fishing and has developed low maintenance cages, anti-predator, anti-bird systems for aquaculture business, which is being increasingly accepted by customers.
 
 Aquaculture, also known as aqua farming, is the farming of aquatic organisms, such as fish, under controlled conditions, and is different from commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Similarly, the company had launched covering nets and sheets aimed at domestic agriculture for protecting farm produce from elements like excessive sunlight or hailstorm as well as from birds. They, too, are fast gaining traction.
 
 ""Products aimed at aquaculture in the exports market and agriculture in the domestic market will drive revenue growth,"" said Garware. According to him, nets and solutions supplied to the mechanised fishing and aquaculture industries together contribute half the company's revenues.
 
 In the process, the company's operating profit margins, too, will grow, thanks to its ongoing measures to curtail costs and also economies of scale on production ramp-up. The company's operating profit margins remained stable between 10% and 11% of net sales in the last five years.
 
 Garware Wall Ropes makes a range of products from threads, ropes, nets to coated fabrics, which are used in heavy-duty, specialised applications like towing ships, mechanised fishing and aquaculture, nets used in sports like tennis or soccer, geo-synthetics to prevent soil erosion or rock fall protection. The company's sports nets are used in tennis grand slams, football World Cups as well as during Olympics.
 
 The company carries nearly 107 crore of debt, and has a debt-equity ratio of 0.4. Over 75% of the debt is for working capital. The company has a long history of paying dividend, and has a dividend yield of 3.5% at present. The company recently reduced its capital 7.7% under a buyback arrangement. The scrip is valued at 6.5 times its earnings for the past 12 months and price-to-book-value of 0.6.

 Similarly, the metal for delivery in January moved up by 90 paise, or 0.09 per cent, to Rs 967.50 per kg in 583 lots.

Oil companies will be investors preferred choice soon: Sudip Bandyopadhyay,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/oil-companies-will-be-investors-preferred-choice-soon-sudip-bandyopadhyay/articleshow/38548802.cms,m.economictimes.com,Oil companies will be investor’s preferred choice soon: Sudip Bandyopadhyay,"In a chat with ET Now, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, President, Destimoney Securities, shares his views on oil and gas space. 

 
ET Now: Since the entire oil and gas space has taken a bit of backseat really post the budget, is it a good time to accumulate if one has missed out on the rally? 

 
Sudip Bandyopadhyay: Absolutely correct. In fact, this is exactly what we have been advising our clients. This is one space where there will be a complete re-rating once the gas price revision announcement comes. Look it is a matter of time. The government has kept a dead line of 30th September and we believe it will happen even before that. 

 Now whatever happens whether we go to that magic number of 8.4 or we settle somewhat below that at 6.8 or whatever is being talked about, that will straight way help these companies. 

 The second issue which we all must remember is the government is committed and they are on the path of gradual market linked pricing of all the petroleum products. 

 These steps help in a big way the oil marketing companies and over a period of time the entire, the burden of subsidy and the uncertainty pertaining to the subsidy will disappear and these companies being fundamentally strong otherwise will be an investor’s preferred choice for investment very shortly.

OMCs brave market volatility;surge to 52-week high on positive outlook,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/omcs-brave-market-volatilitysurge-to-52-week-high-on-positive-outlook/articleshow/47924900.cms,m.economictimes.com,OMCs brave market volatility;surge to 52-week high on positive outlook,"MUMBAI: The oil marketing companies (OMCs) held the fort when the Nifty fell from all-time high to sub 8,000 levels recently. These stocks continued to consolidate and are trading at 52-week high levels today. 

 The sharp rally in OMC counters was triggered by robust 4QFY15 results aided by abnormally high marketing margins and strength in refining margins. 

 ""OMCs have had an exceptional run in the past two years (up 99-347 per cent from August 2013 lows, vs Nifty rising 50 per cent). However, the benefits of reforms, benign oil prices and strength in refining do not seem fully factored in. We estimate steep 53-134 per cent earnings growth in FY16F, with IOC (the laggard so far) leading the pack,"" said Nomura report. 

 The brokerage house is of the view that market concerns on government of India’s interference in pricing / subsidies have now nearly vanished. 

 ""OMC stocks should be driven more by fundamentals and the scope for further re-rating remains,"" it said. 

 Nomura has raised IOC’s target price to Rs 515 from Rs 385 earlier, HPCL to Rs 935 from Rs 675 earlier and BPCL to Rs 1055 from Rs 810 earlier. 

 Since decontrol, OMCs have been recording super-normal margins on diesel, averaging Rs 1.8/litre, says Edelweiss report. 

 Diesel and petrol prices have been revised effective from July 1, 2015 — diesel prices have been cut by INR0.7/litre and petrol by INR0.3/litre. Oil price has extended its steady decline having corrected ~2 per cent since the previous fortnight. 

 ""Based on our global case studies, we had highlighted that marketing margins are poised to rise by as much as ~150 per cent and earnings of OMCs (HPCL, BPCL and IOCL) could double over the next 3 years,"" the report added. 

 However Kotak Institutional Equities is advising investors to be cautious in OMCs pack after stellar rally. 

 According to analysts at the brokerage house, marketing margins for these companies have moderated and refining margins are unlikely to sustain at such high levels. 

 ""We advise caution on the rich valuation of HPCL (REDUCE). We fine-tune estimates/target price for OMCs and retain ADD on BPCL and IOCL, though we will look for better entry points,"" the report said.

"Once Axis Bank crosses 1250, strength will return: Rajat Bose",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/once-axis-bank-crosses-1250-strength-will-return-rajat-bose/articleshow/7424356.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Once Axis Bank crosses 1250, strength will return: Rajat Bose"," 
  
  What is the call on Axis Bank?
   
  
  Rajat Bose: It is currently ruling at 1241 and Axis Bank generally tends to be a market performer when you look at from the short term perspective and the fact that it is trading below 15 points from yesterday’s close does not mean that it has become weak. I would consider weakness signs facing only if it were to fall below 1234 and sustain there. Otherwise, Axis Bank can stage a pullback and once it trades above 1250, once again that strength would be clearly visible. So nothing much to worry about as such as of now.
   
  
  What about the index?
  
   
  
  Rajat Bose: If you look at the option build up, the kind of open interest build up in the options segment, only now we are witnessing that 5500 calls might have added about 4 lakh shares additional. While there is some addition even inputs as well but it appears that the key level that I was watching for that was 5476 and now that it is holding out, I am not ruling out recovery but at the same time, I was not really expecting it to sustain below 5476 and the next stop was 5463 which happens to me the day’s low. Mind you if 5476 is not held out on a closing basis, then bulls would actually become much weaker once again and selling pressure might mount. 
  
  But given the build up that we have seen in puts in the last couple of days and also recovering in falls, it does not worry me so much right at this point in time, of course short sellers are bit aggressive at 5500 levels. So that could put some pressure at 5505 level for the Nifty but let’s wait as to how the day and the week comes to a close. I would say the nascent rally has not yet completed. It would still have some headroom left.
   
  
  Jain Irrigation on the charts?
   
  
  Rajat Bose: It has already recovered to about 191 from a level close to about 150 a few trading sessions back and that was a vertical fall. So vertical falls generally tend to give a good bounce back and this is that bounce back that is happening and then between 200 and 210, you would see Jain Irrigation probably would be meeting a lot of supply pressure. It needs to be seen as to how it reacts to that selling pressure. If the stock sustains above 200 going forward, then it would be pretty good. Otherwise at least for the 6 long months there had been distribution on this stock and this stock for all practical purposes looks like a sell on rallies and I would not really suggest people to actually get into this stock and while this rally should be used to actually exit the counter.

ONGC has potential to double in next two years: Analysts,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ongc-has-potential-to-double-in-next-two-years-analysts/articleshow/40989785.cms,m.economictimes.com,ONGC has potential to double in next two years: Analysts,"MUMBAI: The decline in global crude oil prices and gradual diesel de-regulation exercise has come as a boon for oil & gas major ONGC.
 
 The oil ministry has proposed to rationalise the subsidy-sharing mechanism for state-run oil producers, a move that is expected to reduce the burden on ONGC and Oil India. The government is likely to cap ONGC and Oil India’s share of subsidy burden to 50 per cent each.
 
 According to reports, the ministry has proposed to consider OID (oil industry development) cess paid by ONGC and OIL as part of their subsidy share. In return, the companies would pay royalty to states on the full price of crude and not the discounted rate offered to government refiners.
 
 Analysts are of the view that such a move will be EPS accretive for ONGC over the next two years. It will also benefit the government to sell stake in the company through OFS route.
 
 ""If oil subsidy continues to fall as expected we think that ONGC-OIL would be better off under the 50 per cent:50 per cent subsidy sharing formula than under the prevailing subsidy formula or the Parikh committee formula assumed by us,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.
 
 ""Under the 50%:50% subsidy sharing formula ONGC-OIL’s subsidy would be lower and net oil price realization higher than assumed,"" the report said.
 
 ONGC and OIL give discounts to help state refiners cover part of their losses from selling diesel and kitchen fuels at government-capped rates. Over the years, this discount has risen from 30 per cent in 2008-09 to 48 per cent in 2013-14.
 
 At last count, the discount stood at $56 on a barrel of crude. In addition, the producers also paid $18-19 as Central and state levies on each barrel of oil. Against a minimum return of $65 a barrel required to provide money for future exploration, the companies have been taking home only $31 on a price of $105 per barrel.
 
 ""The big deal in ONGC is that, we have arguably a good and visionary government in power. If they do the things to ONGC that I am dreaming and imagining of, there is no reason why ONGC should not double from here as well. It is a question of what the government does,"" said Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
 
 Under the proposed 50:50 per cent subsidy sharing formula, ONGC’s EPS would get a good boost.
 
 According to BofA ML report, ONGC’s FY15-16E EPS would be 2-8 per cent higher under 50:50 per cent subsidy sharing formula than under Parikh committee formula.
 
 In a recent report, CLSA increased its weightage on ONGC in India’s model portfolio.
 
 ""Driven by a 59 per cent decline in oil subsidies over the next two years as diesel subsidies are eliminated, we see post-subsidy crude realisation for ONGC to rise from US$41/bbl to US$50/bbl, despite our assumption of 100 per cent subsidy burden for upstream names,"" the report said.
 
 ""This, along with the doubling of the domestic gas price, will ensure a 22 per cent EPS Cagr over two years. ONGC is our top pick in the state-owned spacewith a BUY rating and Rs 530 target based on 11x PE to core business,"" the report added.
 
 The brokerage has ‘Buy’ rating with a price target of Rs 530 on ONGC.

Vijai Mantri: We have reduced our IT exposure little bit. We were significantly overweight on IT and pharma, but now we are little less overweight on these sector. We continue to believe that these sectors will continue to deliver performance. 

 Rupee has come down from 62 levels to close to 61 levels or from 63-64 levels to 61 levels. But, most of the IT billing for last quarter happened around 57-58 levels. Even if the billing happened at Rs 60, it won't be a bad thing. We continue to believe that IT industry will continue to show visibility on the earnings. 

 On the other hand, a lot of cyclicals are available at multi-year low. But, the challenge is whether the next government form and whether they will start the reform. Even if they start the reform, it will take a while before we see the visibility on the balance sheet of these companies. 

 Right now, our focus would be to own cash rich companies and companies which have a more visibility on the earnings.

 Financial analysts have put down the drop in the KSE index to the political uncertainty prevailing in the country due to the ongoing sit-ins by Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e -Insaaf and Tahirul Qadri's Pakistan Awami Tehreek in Islamabad, demanding Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation. 

 The positive sentiment by investors can be put down to the announcement that the army was going to mediate and find a solution to the political crisis, one trader said. 

 Pakistan's economic outlook had improved since the government of business-friendly Nawaz Sharif came to power with foreign exchange reserves having doubled from $7 billion to $14 billion. 

 Earlier in July, ratings agency Moody's had also upgraded Pakistan's country outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' citing its improving external liquidity position and commitment to reforms.

 The contract for May delivery climbed as much as 2.2% to 2,795 ringgit ($854) a metric tonne on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level for the mostactive contract since September 2012, and was at 2,793 ringgit at 5:11 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures are set for an 9.2% gain this month. 

 Production in Malaysia dropped about 9% in the first 20 days of the month from the same period in January, said Paramalingam Supramaniam, a director at Pelindung Bestari, a Selangor-based broker, citing estimates from the Malaysian Palm Oil Association. Output fell to 1.51 million tonne last month and reserves shrank to 1.93 million tonne, Malaysian Palm Oil Board data show. The harvest is the lowest in January and February because of growing cycles. 

 “Lower inventories of between 1.7 million to 1.8 million tonne are expected due to the lower production this month,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “The cut to soybean crop estimates may increase dependency on palm oil, keeping stockpiles low.” 

 Output of soybeans, crushed to make an alternative oil, will be 4.4% less than earlier expected in South America after dry weather hurt crops in Brazil, according to Oil World. 

 Prices rose on speculation that an El Nino weather pattern can occur later this year, impacting palm oil production, said Hiro Chai, vice-president at CIMB Futures in Kuala Lumpur. The El Nino, which can parch Australia and parts of Asia while bringing rains to South America, may occur in the coming months, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said on Tuesday.

But, a slump in the intellectual property related business, which came on top of a solid growth in the previous quarter, pulled down the growth in the overall revenue. 

 Revenue rose by 2.2% to $69.9 million sequentially during the December quarter. The growth in the products engineering and platform solutions was 3.8%, making it the fourth consecutive quarter in which it exceeded 3% increase. 

 The other division that derives business from intellectual property (IP) related activities reported a sequential drop of 4.8% in revenue. Revenue from this division have been lumpy due to the nature of business which involves selling licenses and services for applications whose IP lies with the company. In the previous quarter, it had reported an increase of 37.4% following a drop of 12.4% in the June 2013 quarter. 

 Despite a moderation in the growth of the total revenue due to the slack in the IP business, the company’s operating margin expanded by 180 basis points to 21.7%. This was on account of lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. Cost optimisation and recovery of some of the revenue, which was provided for in the earlier quarters led to lower SG&A. Barring this, the company has not changed its SG&A strategy on a year-on-year basis, according to the chief operating officer Mritunjay Singh. 

 He told ET that the order book looks strong following an upbeat demand in the US market. The company has also started investing in some of the European countries including France, Germany, and the UK. The company does not provide the order book size.

PFC tax free Bonds oversubscribed 12.09x on the first day,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/pfc-tax-free-bonds-oversubscribed-12-09x-on-the-first-day/articleshow/49229630.cms,m.economictimes.com,PFC tax free Bonds oversubscribed 12.09x on the first day,"MUMBAI: Power Finance Corporation’s Rs 700-crore tax-free bond issue was oversubscribed several times within hours of its opening on Monday, breaking NTPC’s record set two weeks ago, reaffirming the belief that RBI’s higher-than-expected rate cut is driving investors to such offerings. 

 On the first day of subscription, the state-owned company received subscriptions worth Rs 8,461 crore against the core issue size of Rs 100 crore, excluding an option to retain oversubscription up to Rs 600 crore mandated earlier by the government. The company is likely to close the issue on Tuesday, well before the scheduled closing date of October 9. 

 ""Two factors led to investor exuberance in the issue,"" said Vikram Dalal, managing director, Synergee Capital. ""Firstly, the PFC issue was finalised before the latest RBI rate cut and the reduction did not reflect in the pricing. Secondly, tax-free bonds issued in 2013-14 are now trading at a premium after the repo rate cut. Future tax-free issues would broadly offer 20-25 bps lower rates,"" he said. 

 Four categories of investors —retail, high net-worth individuals, corporates and qualified institutions — can invest in these bonds with 10-, 15-, and 20-year maturities subject to different rates. A retail investor can earn as high as 7.36 per cent, 7.52 per cent and 7.60 per cent for the three maturities, respectively. 

 The Reserve Bank of India slashed the benchmark rate by 50 basis points in its bi-monthly monetary policy on September 29. Since then, the benchmark bond yield has dipped by about 20-25 bps, pushing prices up. Retail investors have bid for Rs 2,069 crore against an upper investment limit of Rs 280 crore, while high net-worth individuals’ subscription to the issue is eight times more than the category limit of Rs 175 crore. 

 ""If we consider the shift in GSec yields, the coupon offered by PFC is quite attractive,"" said Deepak Panjwani, head - debt markets, GEPL Capital. ""This is an all-time record as investors showed tremendous appetite for PFC tax-free bonds."" 

 Eligible institutional borrowers’ bid was 22 times more than the Rs 70 crore limit for the category. A triple-A rated issuer can sell bonds to retail investors at a rate that is 55 basis points lower than similar maturity government bond yields, according to a circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes of the finance ministry on July 6. 

 The government has mandated that issuers would price tax-free bonds at 80 bps less than similar-maturity government bonds for institutional investors. ""After the NTPC and PFC issues, other tax-free bond issuers may struggle a bit to draw investor interest,"" said Ajay Manglunia, head, fixed income, Edel- weiss Securities.

The fall in weak market is a good opportunity for investors to add the duo in portfolio.

 He is of the view that telecom sector has been the most profitable sector in the economy in the last five years and there is no ground for anyone to argue on any financial parameter of listed players. 

 ""They have done the best on financial parameters. Today where every company is struggling to maintain even basic tenets of volumes and price; these companies have shown phenomenal growth rate of 20-30 per cent,"" Srivastava said. 

 CLSA has maintained ‘Buy’ rating on Idea Cellular after Q4 results. According to the brokerage, the company’s 4QFY15 revenue of Rs 84 billion, led by strong data traffic growth, was in line with estimates. 

 ""Ebitda, at Rs 30.4 billion, was 8 per cent ahead of estimates mainly due to lower network operating costs and PAT was 16 per cent ahead of estimates with 3x jump in investment income,"" the report said. 

 ""We upgrade our Ebitda estimates by 1-3% for FY16-18CL mainly led by higher margins. Besides Idea’s strong performance, in recent auction it secured crucial renewal spectrum ending the longstanding overhang on business,"" it added.

 On a consolidated basis, Bharti reported 4QFY15 revenues of Rs 230 billion whereas EBITDA stood at Rs 81.1 billion. 

 ""EBITDA outperformance was driven by the India business even as Africa EBITDA disappointed again. Part of the EBITDA outperformance was also on account of reversal of CSR expenses as the company changed accounting policy on CSR expensing,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities report.

  Every contract has got the other side to it as well but coming to the market it does look like small recovery on the way. 
  
  Markets are trying to bounce back, at least select stocks have made a bounce back but there is a possibility we could see the swings in both directions. 
  
  Best strategy right now is stick to very short term trades, not even a four-five day swing trade but just a day trade or a overnight with tight stop losses and once some trend develops then again you can linked in the duration of the trades.

But overall if the problem, and we all hope it will be contained, if it is contained, then I guess it is good for another 20% over the next one year or so and by that time you hope that the domestic CV cycle will turn and will ensure and will act as a buffer for whatever growth disappointment that is bound to come in JLR will come.

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 37 points higher at 5861, indicating a higher opening on the domestic market. 

 The Nifty index ended its two-day winning streak on Monday and closed in the red as rupee depreciated against the US dollar following better than expected jobs data in the US. 

 Though the Nifty managed to recover losses intraday, but still ended with losses of 56 points. Daily chart indicates that, Nifty once again shutting shop below its 200- Days Simple Moving Average i.e. below 5830 levels. 

 “Every time Nifty manages to stage a strong comeback, the bears resumed their onslaught. Their pullback rally was just not good enough for the market to close in the green,” said Swati A. Hotkar, Technical Analyst at LKP Advisory. 

 “It looks like Nifty is playing with gaps and each time we gap-down by the end of the day we recover. So what is happening here is that this is a market that is not clearly going down substantially on bad news which is a positive sign,” she added. 

 We believe that Nifty is trading in the range of 5750-5950 i.e. 200 points range and me may get a smooth rally once it manages to come out from the range bound trading. 

 Hotkar is of the view that traders should hold on to their long positions with the strict stop loss of 5750 levels. 

 Indian rupee continued to weaken against the US dollar and hit a fresh all-time low on Monday. The rupee breached 61 to the dollar mark in opening trade itself following strong US non-farm payroll data on Friday. 

 Movement of rupee will be in focus as further depreciation may put markets under pressure. However, most experts are of the view that the currency does look oversold and tired at 61 levels. 

 “The momentum is still bearish and big voices on the street are calling rupee undervalued at current levels,” said Manisha Gupta, Editor -Currency and Commodities at ET Now. 

 “They are predicting Rs 70 per dollar plus kind of levels. If the forecasts are to be believed then brace for more pain in the rupee market and Indian equities as well,” she added. 

 Overnight, US stocks closed higher building on gains sparked by last week's robust employment report which suggested that economy is on the path of recovery. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 88.85 points, or 0.59 per cent, to end at 15,224.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 8.57 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 1,640.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 5.45 points, or 0.16 per cent, to close at 3,484.83. 

 Asian stocks edged higher but investors were still nervous over China's new drive to reform credit to restructure the economy. 

 ""China shares had their worst day in two weeks on Monday, after China's leadership laid out plans to ensure banks would support an economic rebalancing to efficient high-end manufacturing from industrial overcapacity and extravagant investment funded by cheap debt,"" Reuters reported.

 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June policy meeting released on Wednesday highlighted that Fed will continue buying bonds until the labor market outlook improves substantially. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 89 points higher at 5895, indicating a higher opening on the domestic market. 

 The Nifty extended intraday fall in the afternoon and closed above 5,800 on Wednesday as traders booked profits in absence of supportive cues from European peers. 

 Nifty consolidated for the first half session in the narrow range of 5870-5850 off levels, but in the second half trading sessions bulls failed lost their grip and the index slipped towards its key support level of 5800. 

 “Daily Chart indicates that Nifty is hovering near the 200-DMA i.e. at 5830 levels. Overall the picture is not clear and the market is still going through a consolidation phase,” said Swati A. Hotkar, Technical Analyst at LKP Advisory. 

 Unfortunately, the Bank Nifty has not participated well which could act as a dampener. The index did tried to give some intraday buy signals, but failed to sustain above 11,500 levels on closing basis, she added. 

 Hotkar is of the view that unless and until Nifty doesn't come out from the trading range we may not get a smooth rally. As long as Nifty respects 5750 levels traders should maintain the positive bias. 

 The index has been consolidating in a narrow range for some time now, but analysts are of the view that the index will not break at the lower end of the range i.e. at 5750 levels. 

 “I would still not read into this as a weakness where we will break down off of 5750 and come down to 5550 or so. Tomorrow, the index is likely to rally towards 5850-5900,” said Sandeep Wagle, Founder & MD, APTART Technical Advisory Services in an interview with ET Now. 

 “However, a decisive move will only come when 5900 is broken on the upside or a 5750 is broken on the downside,” he added. 

 Overnight, US stocks ended flat but Ben Bernanke's comments sent U.S. stock index futures higher. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 8.68 points, or 0.06 percent, to end at 15,291.66. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index inched up just 0.30 of a point, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 1,652.62. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 16.50 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 3,520.76.

PSBs a good bet from a 2-3-year perspective: Angel Broking,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/psbs-a-good-bet-from-a-2-3-year-perspective-angel-broking/articleshow/15307319.cms,m.economictimes.com,PSBs a good bet from a 2-3-year perspective: Angel Broking,"In a chat with ET Now, P Phani Sekhar, Fund Manager-PMS, Angel Broking, shares his views on banking pack. 

 
ET Now: What is the call on banking pack? 

 P Phani Sekhar: The private sector banks remain our favourite. However, after seeing the public sector banks’ numbers, we tend to believe that some of the stocks like say an Allahabad Bank or Dena Bank, which we have been liking for the last two quarters or so, may continue to do well. Especially considering the fact that stock like Allahabad Bank has corrected almost 30% in the last 1.5 months or so.
 
 Union Bank, if one can lay one’s hands on it at around 140-145 levels, the stock looks attractive from a longer term perspective because a large damage has been done from an asset quality perspective. Although, there might be more slippages but at least investors now have a firm handle on what kind of slippages and restructurings to expect, because a large bulk of it is behind us.
 
 So, now it is much easier to value these companies as compared to what it was, maybe a quarter back and valuations since then have corrected to around 0.7 or 0.8 times, it offers much more margin of safety. The dividend yields have cropped, have jumped up to 5% to 6% which is an added attraction. So all these combined, public sector banks might be a good bet from a 2 to 3-year perspective from these levels.

Punj Lloyd rallies on reports of Medanta Medicity stake sale,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/engineering/stake-sale-in-medanta-medicity-by-year-end-punj-lloyd/articleshow/45324118.cms,m.economictimes.com,Stake sale in Medanta Medicity by year-end: Punj Lloyd,"
 NEW DELHI: Engineering and construction major Punj Lloyd will finalise its stake sale in Gurgaon-based hospital Medanta Medicity by December-end, a move aimed at reducing the company's Rs 6,000 crore debt. 

 Punj Lloyd holds 17 per cent stake in Global Health Pvt Ltd - a company which owns, manages and operates the hospital for around Rs 300 crore. 

 It plans to sell half the stake in Medanta Medicity, which is a multi-super speciality institute, founded by renowned heart surgeon Naresh Trehan. There have been reports of Singapore's Temasek buying that stake from Punj Lloyd. 

 ""I am aware that we are selling the stake of Medanta, but Temasek buying is news to me,"" Punj Lloyd MD and CEO J P Chalasani told PTI. 

 The stake sale is likely to be announced by December- end, Chalasani said without divulging further details. 

 ""It will help us in reducing our debt cost which is an important aspect for us ...Rs 6,000 crore is a significant debt for us, some of the things that we are trying to do is non-core asset monetisation,"" he said. 

 The company, so far, had an order-book position at Rs 11,000 crore. 

 ""For us our main market is global. That is the reason we are sometimes insulated from the market fluctuations here (India) because its unlikely that all markets simultaneously collapse,"" Chalasani said. 

 He added: ""So our order-book has always been healthy. This year (2014-15) has been good year. So far its around Rs 11,000 crore except for a Rs 666 crore highway contract every order is from outside and the overall the order backlog is Rs 24,000 crore as on today.""
 
 The company is also eyeing opportunities in the upcoming metro projects. 

 ""Order-booking is not a concern for us at this stage, India is now opening up, metro work is picking up in most cities, that is one area we are looking at,"" Chalasani said.

 Market participants are bullish on railway stocks as Modi has been emphasising the need for improving the rail network, making it more contemporary, similar to the Japanese railway system.
 
 Kalindee Rail rallied 19.9%, Kernex Microsystems rose 19.9%, Texmaco surged 19.3%, BEML jumped 19.3%, while Hind Rectifiers gained 17.5% at the BSE on Monday.
 
 The BJP election manifesto said that the government will introduce high-speed Bullet trains, launch the Diamond Quadrilateral project for high-speed train network, build 100 new modern cities, and expedite freight and industrial corridors to improve the country's infrastructure and create jobs.
 
 According to reports, the railway corridors Mumbai-Ahmedabad and New Delhi-Patna are on the priority list for the new government.
 
 ""Investment in railway infrastructure is an economic imperative; even a small increase in incremental capex will result in significant benefits,"" said Satish Kumar, analyst at Standard Chartered Securities, in a note to its clients. ""Our in-depth study and on-the-ground checks of the commonly ignored railway sector reveal a Rs 5 lakh-crore opportunity for companies,"" Kumar added.
 
 BJP and its allies enjoy a majority of 335 in the 543-member house, and Modi is unlikely to face much resistance in pushing reforms.
 
 Railway stocks are still about 70% below their life-time highs of late 2007 -- the peak of the previous bull run. However, investors stayed away from these stocks as the government did not make any major announcements in the last few years.
 
 ""The railway companies have not received any major orders for the last couple of years, and I hope this will change,"" said Sunil Jain, head of equity research at Nirmal Bang. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion has been pushing for FDI in railways since August last, and this is also seen as big trigger for these companies. DIPP is in favour of 100% FDI in railway transport like elevated rail corridor projects, freight terminals, suburban corridors and dedicated freight lines.

ET Now: What is the sense that you are getting about the telecom sector and especially newsy companies like Bharti Airtel, just yesterday we heard about them losing a case in Nigeria and then of course the acquisition of Loop mobile as well how would you approach the sector? 

 
Anand Tandon: There is serious consolidation that has happened for all practical purpose around the four players now. Therefore we will be ending up paying a lot more for making calls. 

 It may not have happened immediately and whenever Reliance Jio actually rolls out their plans you may have some amount of stickiness on the price of way up because there will be an initial kind of fight for customers at least on the data side. 

 But aside from there the expenses are done, the uncertainty in terms of how much money they have to pay for retaining their circles is now out of the picture. While there may be some issues that couple of the companies may have had to pay a little more by and large the negatives are in the price. 

 Now Bharti has a problem separately in Africa because they cannot gain market share easily but at least for something like Idea for example I do not see much of a downside from here. So over a slightly longer term frame when I am saying three to five years from now you should expect to make fairly good money if you were to invest at current level, you would probably beat inflation and interest rates.

Refinery stocks becoming hot-picks due to improving gross refining margins,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/refinery-stocks-becoming-hot-picks-due-to-improving-gross-refining-margins/articleshow/49993467.cms,m.economictimes.com,Refinery stocks becoming hot-picks due to improving gross refining margins,"Refineries stocks, which are often viewed as the ugly ducklings of the hydrocarbon chain, are becoming favourites of investors owing to improving gross refining margins (GRM), lower working capital requirements and shrinking fuel loss on feedstock due to falling crude oil prices. 

 Typically, crude oil accounts for 95% of the total expenditure of the oil refinery. Prices of crude oil fell 21% this year over and above a drop of almost 50% in 2014 thus benefiting refineries. 

 Stocks of refineries including Chennai Petroleum, MRPL, Reliance Industries and Essar Oil have gained in double digits since January 2015 even as the Nifty has lost 5%. 

 Gross refining margins have either improved or remained stable since prices of petroleum products such as petrol diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) have fallen less sharply than crude oil prices. For instance, petrol price has fallen by 37% in the past year against a drop of 45% in crude oil. 
 
 
 
 

 Additionally, cheaper fuel boosts demand. Petrol sales volume grew by 14.8% since January in India, the highest in 12 years and diesel sales grew by 5.38%, a three-year high. 

 Any uptrend in the benchmark GRM is more beneficial to RIL since it earns $2.-2.5 per barrel higher than the benchmark GRM as its refinery can process a wider mix of crude oil varieties. 

 In addition, higher supply of crude is helping refineries in Asia including India to avail of a better bargain from the Arab oil producing nations. Lower prices of crude oil, which is the major feedstock for refineries, means that their working capital need is lower thereby making more funds available for business expansion apart from lower interest payment on short-term financing. 

 Refineries incur fuel loss on the feedstock during processing. When crude oil was hovering at $100 per barrel, fuel loss accounted to $7-9 per barrel, which now has compressed to just $3-4 per barrel.This adds to more profitability of the refineries.

Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: There is a significant build up when it comes to the entire realty pocket.Is there anything that you consider good for an investment? Are these just trading plays for now? 

 
Deven Choksey: From an investment point of view, the housing real estate companies could be little better play compared to the commercial real estate. The inventories would take at least one and a half to two years to clear. If we see traction, then the market will start discounting the one and a half-two years period. Otherwise this particular space is likely to remain a drag to a great extent. 

 I am not too sure about the trading play. On the housing side, the improvements are definitely seen. There is a demand happening. The credit rate and the interest rate are either coming down or are expected to come down. In such situation,there will be better demand for the housing space. So one could remain strong with the housing space within the real estate business.

  MUMBAI: Driven by increase in net interest income, HDFC Bank posted 32.7% rise in net profit for the second quarter of this fiscal year. 
  
  The net profit for the second quarter stood at Rs 912.1 crore while net profit for six months was up 33% at Rs 1,724 crore. Net revenues (net interest income and other income) stood at Rs 3,487 crore, up 15% a year ago. The net interest income (difference between interest earned and interest paid on resources) stood at Rs 2,526 crore, which was driven by 30% asset growth. The net interest margin was 4.2%, same as the corresponding period last year. 
  
  “We expect to grow 4-5 % faster than the system growth (which is projected at 19-20%). Whenever the GDP grows faster, our wholesale loan book has grown faster and whenever the GDP growth slows down, our retail book has grown,” said bank CFO Sashi Jagdishan. “The profit growth is on account of stable margin, robust loan growth and healthy CASA ratio,” he added. The share of low-cost deposits (current and saving account) is half of the total deposits at 50.6% from 47% a year ago. 
  
  Non-interest income fell to Rs 960 crore against Rs 1,007 crore a year ago. The fall is largely on account of treasury loss of Rs 52 crore compared with treasury gains of Rs 165 crore made a year ago. Fees and commission was up 16% to Rs 857 crore against Rs 739 crore. 
  
  Gross advances rose 38% to Rs 158,512 crore. However, after adjusting for one off loans — such as short-term advances — the loan book rose 32%, said Mr Jagdishan. The retail book stood at Rs 81,950 crore and constituted 52% of the total loan book. “During the last quarter, HDFC Bank did not buy any retail home loans from its parent company HDFC. We will buy it in the next quarter,” added Mr Jagdishan. Deposits rose 30.4% to Rs 195,321 crore and half of it was low-cost deposits. The savings account and the current account were Rs 59,525 crore and Rs 39,363 crore, respectively. 
  
  According to Rajiv Mehta, assistant vice-president, India Infoline group, HDFC Bank’s results have exceeded expectations. “The credit deposit ratio touched a multi-quarter high of 80%. The 10 basis point drop in net interest margin was on expected lines as the bank has raised deposit rates twice. Going ahead, we expect margins to stabilise at current levels, aided by the recently announced 25 bps hike in base rate.” He added that the bank was well-placed to tap the expected growth in loans with a capital adequacy ratio of 17%.

Samvat survey: D-Street sees Sensex at 33k by next Diwali,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/samvat-survey-d-street-sees-sensex-at-33k-by-next-diwali/articleshow/49744733.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Samvat survey: D-Street sees Sensex at 33k by next Diwali,"NEW DELHI: Samvat 2072 is likely to be a cracker of a year for equity investors as most market veterans expect benchmark Sensex to head towards a record high of 33,000 in next one year. They expect Nifty50 to top 9,500 by next Diwali, shows a survey conducted by ETMarkets.com. 

 Most analysts see the Sensex move in a 3,000-point range in next one year, while Nifty50 could well top 9,500 in the same period. 

 Samvat 2071 started on a bullish note, but failed to keep up the momentum on Dalal Street, as the benchmark indices plunged over 6 per cent in the last one year, weighed down by both domestic as well as global factors. Both Sensex and Nifty 50 ended the Samvat year over 2 per cent down. 

 “We believe this was a healthy period of consolidation after the rally witnessed last year. We expect earnings growth to pick up going forward and have a 12-month price target of 31,500 for the Sensex and 9,540 for the Nifty50, implying 18 times FY2017E earnings,” said Dinesh Thakkar, CMD, Angel Broking. 

 

 
 

 

 Participants of the ETMarkets.com survey were near unanimous in their assessments that Samvat 2072 looks very promising. After a sharp correction so far in calendar 2015, experts see market valuations at reasonable level and advise investors with a long-term horizon to look at building a strong portfolio by accumulating stocks on every dip. 

 Motilal Oswal, Chairman & Managing Director of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, expects earnings growth to accelerate in the next few quarters leading to a healthy market performance. 

 “The macro-economic stability achieved in last two years has been quite impressive. We are looking at a market return of 20 per cent by next Diwali and expect Sensex to hit 33,000,” he said. 

 
Bull or bear market? 

 The bull vs bear argument has always caught investors’ attention in the past. The S&P BSE Sensex has plunged nearly 15 per cent from the record high of 30,024.74 hit in March. 

 One key highlight of Samvat 2071 has been strong domestic flows into the market, apart from continuing FII flows, which analysts say should keep the momentum going in Samvat 2072. Domestic institutions have invested Rs 50,500 crore in equities so far this year. It is clear that savings are finally moving to financial assets from physical assets, said Kotak Securities. 

 While it will be fair to say that the Indian market is on course to hit a fresh record high, the journey will not be as exciting as it was in Samvat 2070 or calendar 2014. 

 “A lot has happened since last Diwali. Though the index may seem flat, going ahead I still feel that next three to six months will continue to be challenging. The first speed breaker hump is going to be the Fed rate hike,” trader Atul Suri said in an interview with ET Now. 

 “Nobody knows how much of it has been discounted by the market. I personally feel we will have some hiccups before that and earnings growth will a big factor for India,” he said. 

 Suri is of the view that earnings revival has to come to make a case for a larger fundamental bull market to take the indices to lifetime highs. “That is something we have been hoping, hoping, hoping and well we are still hoping.” 

 Most experts expect the market to remain rangebound for the next two quarters given the lack of earnings growth. Earnings are expected to pick up from March 2016, which will lead to a gradual pickup in the broader market, they say. 

 But the bigger trigger would come from pro-growth reforms initiated by the government in the last one-year or so. “Clearly, from this Diwali to next, we would be higher, but it remains to be seen whether you are going to get mega returns or not. For mega returns to come, you need to solve the infrastructure problem which the government is actively working on,” said S Naren, CIO, ICICI Prudential AMC. 

 “The government has to ensure that the level of real estate under construction and the money stuck there comes down, and the ease of doing business happens. All of this will take more a year, maybe, to play out, but once these three factors are taken care of, you will have a sizeable bull market. If these do not happen, you will get marginal a bull market,” he said. 

 
What will push the market higher in Samvat 2072? 

 Most experts feel the fall in interest rates, earnings revival, capex takeoff and continuation of reforms will push the equity market higher in Samvat 2072. 

 The government has already taken several executive and administrative initiatives to increase the ease of doing business and support growth, which should start showing their impact in the next 12 months or so. 

 Kotak Securities said the government has increased spending by 61 per cent YoY in the first half of FY16. There is a strong focus on infrastructure creation and on bringing in funds for the same. However, any delay in the passage of important legislations like GST would impact market sentiments negatively. 

 ""Going ahead, we expect fiscal reforms to pick up speed in Samvat 2072. Important legislations, especially GST, are expected to be passed, even if in a diluted form,” said the report. “Inflation has come off over the past few months and, we believe it will continue to trend lower. This would open up the window for more rate cuts in FY17,” they say. 

 Major global economies are battling slowdown and there are expectations that lower global growth will push commodities prices southward, which is expected to continue in the short term, but India would still manage to steal the show, experts said. 

 “We believe India presents itself with an opportunity for investors -- both domestic and overseas -- in the medium to long term. We recommend investors to focus on investment in businesses that are likely to receive support from favourable government policies,” said Pradeep Gupta, Co-Founder & Vice-Chairman, AnandRathi Financial Services. 

 “Some of the key initiatives taken up by the government to further improve business environment include the ‘Make in India’ initiative for broader manufacturing with a special emphasis on defence manufacturing. It is estimated that defence spending will increase to almost Rs 3 lakh crore by FY19,” he said.

ET Now: What are you advising clients with regards to infra or PSU banks, have you recommended any names to your clients? 

 Hemang Jani: We have already seen the top rung banks going up by about 8% to 10%. Some of the second rung banks such as Bank of India, Syndicate Bank or Canara Bank, are looking promising because we have not really seen that bigger move in those counters. They have also been beaten down badly. So, we believe that Canara Bank, Bank of India or a Syndicate Bank can give another probably 10% to 12% kind of upside.

We are just going about our business. Spaces other than banking are participating. The market would have been in trouble otherwise. IT and auto has come back. Commodities, metals, etc, are making come back. This sort of sector rotation will ensure that the Nifty remains up.The spaces can correct in the background.

  Did you have a look at the auto sales numbers because this time around for the month of April? It has not been a spectacular month so to speak like we have been seeing over the last few months where records have been broken on a sequential basis?
  
   
  
  Prakash Diwan: On a relative basis, yes, we have been kind of anticipating this stagnation of numbers or I would say at least a growth rate on month-on-month numbers to kind of flatten out a bit and that expectation has been around for quite sometime in the last 3-4 months but importantly what is going to happen is if auto numbers continue to be decent enough even if the growth is not very spectacular, as long as we can manage the input side of the operations well and that’s something that’s causing a lot of concern because most of them have not been able to increase prices.
  
  There is a little bit of a doubt whether the input costs have been completely absorbed or factored in, so all these issues are what’s raising probably a little bit of hackles for the auto investors but otherwise, autos would still continue to see about another quarter, two quarters of decent growth and it is only after that that we will have to revaluate in terms of whether this sector is down and out.

The S&P BSE Sensex hit its all-time high after a flat start, led by gains in realty stocks, Infosys, TCS, HDFC and Dr Reddy's Laboratories.  The previous all-time high for Sensex was 27,354.99.  At 1:10 p.m.; the 30-share index was at 27296.78, up 219.10 points or 0.81 per cent. It touched a high of 27,358.85 and a low of 27,088.65 in early trade ..  Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also managed to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8150, led by gains in realty, IT and consumer durable stocks.  However, the rupee depreciated by 19 paise to 61.54 against the US currency in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange today due to the dollar’s gain against other currencies overseas.  At 01:20 p.m.; BSE Sensex was trading 201 points higher at 27,999. While, Nifty was up 63 points at 8150.40.  Overnight, the US markets ended marginally lower, while the Asian markets were trading mixed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index was trading 0.80 per cent higher at 15,676 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was trading 0.63 per cent lower at 23,668.  South Korea’s Kospi index was trading 0.32 per cent lower at 1,954 and China’s Shanghai index was trading 0.62 per cent higher at 2,387.  On expected lines, the US Federal Reserve announced the end of its economic stimulus, known as quantitative easing, on Wednesday. The program was launched during the financial crisis in 2008 to stabilize the economy and support the financial system, which pushed the asset prices higher across the world.  The US Federal Reserve has held rates near zero since December 2008 and has more than quadrupled its balance sheet to $4.4 trillion through three separate asset purchase programs, says a Reuters report.   According to experts, the Federal Reserve did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero “for a considerable time,” but investors were hoping for more dovish commentary from the Fed and that’s why most of the global markets were trading mixed.  “Pulling out of the quantitative easing was kind of expected and that has gone by the plan; but the market was expecting them to give somewhat dovish comment about postponing the possible interest rate hike in the US and that did not happen,” said Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Financial Services.  “That comfort did not come and probably, that risk still continues to remain on the markets. So to that extent, the markets would be disappointed, but I do not think anything would change significantly at this point in time as far as Indian markets are concerned,” he added.  The risk still remains more for emerging markets than for India because of relative stable macro picture as and when US Federal Reserve decides to hike interest rates in near future. Analysts say more sharp swings in stocks are likely as that day draws closer.  “The Fed did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero ‘for a considerable time’. Most economists predict the Fed won’t raise that rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, before June,” AP said in a report.  Not just in India, investors across the globe are worried about the fact that when the US Fed plans to raise interest rates, it could impact foreign institutional inflows. So far in October, FIIs have net sold shares worth Rs 3,200 crore in the Indian markets.  Yes, volatility cannot be ruled out. But the flow of money will go on and India happens to be in a sweet spot compared to the rest of the emerging market economies, they say.  “It is a given that QE is going to end from the US, but at the same time, ECB is looking to start another round of QE. Bank of Japan will come up with another QE, but the dollar is going to be strong and it is the dollar that determines the liquidity in the world,” said Rahul Chadha, Co-CIO of Mirae Asset Global Investments.  “The way we look at it is that countries which do the necessary reforms will get the capital because there is going to be enough capital in the world. Thus, it is not a question of everybody getting free money, which is why we remain more confident about India than other economies like Brazil, Russia, etc,” he added.  India’s long-term story intact:  One thing which experts feel very firmly is the fact that India happens to be in a sweet spot and the whole India story remains intact.  Experts feel that India is more prepared than before to face hike in the US interest rates sometime next year. It will only be a sentimental pull back which should be used as buying opportunity by long-term investors.  India has managed to hold onto its macro factors which is very good thing, when compared with the rest of the emerging market economies and that will aide capital flow.  Growth seems to have bottomed out, crude is falling, inflation is stabalising, economy is showing signs of recovery and corporate earnings are expected to grow considerably in the next couple of quarters, which may attract more foreign capital to India.  Globally, the slowdown in growth rates has dampened the sentiment quite a bit, not just for the Indian markets but across the globe. We have also seen commodities that have corrected significantly in the past couple of months.  “But the action is actually in India and I strongly believe that our future in the next six months in terms of equity markets will be more determined by what New Delhi does than what happens across the globe,” said P Phani Sekhar, Fund Manager-PMS at Angel Broking.  Khemani of Edelweiss if of the view that from medium term to long-term perspective, India remains one of the best markets to be invested into, and equity remains one of the best asset class to be invested into.  Investors are also betting that the European Central Bank (ECB) will now announce its stimulus program to revive growth in Euro-zone, and Japan could also do this as early as by the end of this week or beginning next week, say experts. Experts feel that some of this excess liquidity will be coming to India compared to other emerging market economies.  “I expect that both Japan and Europe will continue with monetary easing and quantitative easing for a couple of quarters more and early indication seems to suggest to me that Japan could do this as early as by the end of this week,” said Sashi Krishnan, Chief Investment Officer, Birla Sun Life Insurance.  “Yes, there will be some sort of QE-induced slowdown or outflows of overseas investors coming into India,” he added.

 Net profit of the Non Banking Finance Company was Rs 342.08 crore during the same period of 2012-13 fiscal. 

 ""Despite a difficult operating environment, our asset quality remains fairly stable,"" Shriram Transport Finance's Managing Director and chief executive Umesh Revankar told PTI. 

 While the net interest income, which is the core income of the company, rose 14.1 per cent to Rs 962.8 crore in the April-June quarter, net interest margin stood at 7.01 per cent against 7.42 per cent reported a year earlier. 

 ""Though margins are under pressure due to the operating environment, we hope to hold on to the current level,"" Revankar said. 

 Commercial vehicle financing is going through a lean patch due to economic slowdown impacting players in this space. 

 The company, which deals in the commercial vehicle and equipment financing, said that while its on-balance sheet assets under management (AUM) grew by 40 per cent to Rs 35,910 crore, offbook assets rose by 1.87 per cent to Rs 16,586 crore during the first quarter. 

 Referring to cost of credit, Revankar said that it would depend on the liquidity situation. 

 ""Cost of credit will depend on the liquidity situation. After the RBI measures to squeeze liquidity from the system, short-term rates had gone up. However, we feel that it is a short-term measure and liquidity situation will improve in the future,"" Revankar said. 

 Revankar said the company is increasing its presence in rural areas which will give it higher yield, and it is also trying to diversify funding sources by tapping into the retail space. 

 Shriram Transport Finance, which has recently come up with a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue, is also witnessing sound response to its offer, Revankar said. 

 On the asset quality front, while gross NPA of the company rose to 3.09 per cent from 3 per cent reported a year ago, net NPA increased marginally to 0.68 per cent from 0.62 per cent reported a year ago. 

 ""We have done well in the asset quality front given the current environment. We hope to hold on to the asset quality,"" Revankar said.

ET Now: We keep on talking about how the economic recovery is still some time away. The first one-and-a-half years of the Modi government have not really produced those winners. But somehow the buying interest seems to be in economy-related sectors. Some of the capital goods companies saw some buying last week. We have seen some buying in freight corridor companies such as Gateway Distriparks. Infrastructure names too are attracting attention. HDFC Mutual Fund has bought stake in MEP Infra. What are your thoughts on the wide basket of stocks?
 
 
Harendra Kumar: Some of the names that you mentioned are clearly the companies that have not been investors' favourites in the previous rally. These are smaller names, aligned to the newer opportunities the Modi government is leading them to.
 
 So, the stock picking is happening with the three-year perspective with focus on companies which have clear balance sheets and where investors can bet on their promoters. We are seeing this kind of shift with a lot of investor interest. A corollary to this is obviously the opportunity of smaller companies, which are aligned to state budgets. You would have seen the order book of J Kumar Infra and KNR Infrastructure moving up. Similarly you have PNC Infratech as well. So, the traditional infrastructure names of the previous rally are no longer the favourites. But investors are looking at newer smaller infrastructure or capital goods companies to play on the cyclical recovery.
 
 One caveat I would like to have here is that older capital goods companies which are on the industrial side are extremely expensive, trading typically in the range of 40 PE on forward earnings, even as their ROEs are extremely low. In this context, newer and smaller names are finding more optimism and are seeing buying by fund managers.

Net sales rose to Rs 544.5 crore from Rs 416.2 crore in the year-ago quarter, the company said. 

 “Despite the economy growing below 5%, increasing concerns on high interest rates, continuing inflationary pressures and the steep depreciation of rupee, our performance has been operationally better vis-à-vis the previous quarter,” JC Sharma, vice-chairman and managing director at Sobha Developers, said. 

 The company sold 1 million square feet of new space in the quarter under review against 0.95 million sq ft in the year-ago quarter. Average price realisation increased to Rs 6,304 per sq ft from Rs 5,575 a year ago. 

 “The unbilled revenue as of 30th September is Rs 2,197 crore on the sales made so far, out of which we expect a minimum ofRs 497 crore to be recognised during the second half of the financial year. In addition to this, income from new sales will also contribute to the revenue,” Sharma said.

Despite mixed global cues and rising crude prices, Nifty and Sensex ended higher, with Nifty ending above the 17,700. Broader markets outperformed the headline indices.
 
Here's how analysts read the market pulse:

Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities, said: “Zooming into the 15 minute chart, we see that though Nifty witnessed selling pressure from the highs, the index recovered from the lows and managed to close with healthy gains. The short term trend therefore remains up as the Nifty moved above the previous swing high of 17,429 and made higher bottoms over the last few weeks.
 
Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said: ""Nifty remained volatile during the day before closing on a flat note. On the daily chart, the index has been consolidating for the last few days. However, it has sustained above the crucial moving average on the daily timeframe confirming the uptrend. On the higher end, the index may move towards 17,950. On the lower end, support is visible at 17,650/17,550.""

That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s action:


Stocks gain ground on Wall Street
Stocks mostly rose in morning trading on Wall Street, but major indexes remained unsettled as more big companies report earnings.

The S&P 500 fell 0.3% as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.5%. Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms plummeted 22.1% after reporting a second straight quarter of revenue decline amid falling advertising sales and stiff competition from TikTok. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 452 points, or 1.4%, to 32,299.
 

European markets close higherThe pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day a marginal 0.08% higher, having earlier touched its highest level since September 20 in a see-saw session as traders digested the latest 75 basis point rate hike by the European Central Bank (ECB). European stocks fell after the ECB policy announcement but quickly regained ground and ended the day higher having traded as much as 0.9% lower in the build-up during morning trading.


Tech View: Inside barOn the daily chart, the Nifty formed an Inside Bar. The hourly chart shows that the index is forming a distribution below the key Fibonacci retracement at 17,800 for the last couple of sessions, analysts said. After consolidating around the 17,800 zone for the last three sessions, any upside could lead the index towards the 18000-18200 zone.


Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trend in the counters of SJVN, JSW Steel, DCB Bank, Ircon and DCW, among others.

The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Stable market to arrest slide of banking stocks: Deven Choksey,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/stable-market-to-arrest-slide-of-banking-stocks-deven-choksey/articleshow/21507090.cms,m.economictimes.com,Stable market to arrest slide of banking stocks: Deven Choksey,"In a chat with ET Now, Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Securities, shared her views on the banking sector.
 
 
ET Now: What has spooked the banks? If Tuesday’s policy was more like a no-event, what is really disturbing markets here? Why is the Bank Nifty under intense pressure?
 
 
Deven Choksey: RBI maintained that instead of withdrawing the tight monetary policy and bringing down the rates, they would probably do it in a gradual manner, which could possibly kill this quarter. Wherever they have a bulk deposit related issue, the impact on the margins will come up to a greater extent.
 
 On the back of envelope cases calculation, every 1% increase in the borrowing cost results into around 30 bps negative impact on to the NIMs. Assuming that, there is 2% increase in the borrowing cost, which could go down to by about 60 bps. If this is translated into a quarterly basis, then it would be about a 15 bps impact coming on to the books of these banks. We do not know whether this is an actual impact coming on to the books of these banks because of the bulk deposit. Yet, the market had to readjust and that is where the analysts have downgraded most of the banks because of the bulk deposit related issues.
 
 As market gets some amount of stability based on such calculation, the down fall into the stock prices would probably get arrested. We would probably see some amount of stability before increasing the prices.

Steady track record to drive profit numbers for Shriram Transport,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/steady-track-record-to-drive-profit-numbers-for-shriram-transport/articleshow/5483714.cms,m.economictimes.com,Steady track record to drive profit numbers for Shriram Transport,"
  The quarter ending December 2009 turned out to be the best quarter for Shriram Transport Finance in the current fiscal. The company, which is a market leader in the used commercial vehicle financing, had posted a 20 per cent year-on-year profit growth in the first half of FY10. 
  
  Backed by high growth in disbursements, improvement in net interest margin (NIM) and moderation in operating expenses , the company ended December 2009 quarter with a 59 per cent profit growth.
  
  Shriram Transport’s disbursements were up 70 per cent in the December 2009 quarter, thanks to a recovery in the new commercial vehicle (CV) market. The sales of new CVs are on upward trend and even the freight rates have moved up. Consequently , the demand for financing of new CVs too has gone up. 
  
  However, the growth number is a bit skewed because in the corresponding period last year, the new CV sales had dipped due to the slowdown . Meanwhile, the company posted an impressive 50 per cent growth in disbursements in its niche segment of used CV financing.
  
  The company reported a NIM of 7.33 per cent in December 2009 quarter compared to 6.95 per cent in December 2008 quarter and 7.07 per cent in the September 2009 quarter. The liquidity conditions, which had worsened in the corresponding period last year, have recovered totally, helping in expansion of NIM. 
  
  A part of improvement in NIMs was due to change in the business-mix also. Typically, used CV loan constitute 75 per cent of total disbursements, but in the December 2009 quarter, it constituted 80 per cent of total disbursements. Since old CV loans are high yielding than loans on new CVs, NIMs got an upward thrust. So, a bit of improvement in NIMs was due to one-time factor. 
  
  However, NIM has returned to the normal range and liquidity conditions continue to be healthy. Therefore, it’s unlikely that there will be any pressure on NIMs in the coming months. Meanwhile, the company’s operating expenses including salaries, provisions and write-offs grew by 14 per cent in December 2009 quarter compared to 18 per cent growth in the six months ending September 2009.
  
  On the business side, the recovery in the CV market has started. Since it is a cyclical industry, the current recovery phase is expected to continue for a couple of years. That coupled with the company’s steady record in used CV financing will help it in maintaining a high profit growth, going forward.

Net sales improved to Rs 359.4 crore ( Rs 286.62 crore).
  
  The net profit in Q3 has surpassed the Rs 17.41 crore clocked by the company in 2008-09 on a net sales of Rs 1262.2 crore. The board has declared an interim dividend of 40% for the current year to absorb Rs 8.41 crore.

Devang Mehta: Suven Life Sciences is an excellent high-growth, high-margin business which operates out of the new chemical entity-based, contract research-manufacturing space. 

 Typically, it is a pharma stock which enjoys very high margins. In addition, it has a huge monetisation opportunity for one of its molecule — SUVN-502. The molecule is in the advance stage. 

 Other than this, the company has no working capital issues; it has superb balance sheet and good return ratios. We feel that this stock can probably be a dark horse going forward. We have a very conservative price target of around Rs 336 for Suven Life Sciences.

Texmaco Rail on fast track as wagon demand picks up,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/texmaco-rail-on-fast-track-as-wagon-demand-picks-up/articleshow/43476260.cms,m.economictimes.com,Texmaco Rail on fast track as wagon demand picks up,"ET INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Warren Buffet is bullish on railways, having bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $34 billion four years ago.
 
 The same logic that the railroad makes good economic sense in a country as vast as the US also applies to India and its largest wagon manufacturer Texmaco Rail, which provides the best investment in the rail industry. 

 Texmaco had a bad FY14 though. Under the previous government, very few orders were placed and in the previous fiscal there were none, resulting in FY14 revenue plunging 46%. But with a new government at the Centre, things are changing. 

 The government has highlighted increasing wagon demand by 25% to 25,000 from the current year onwards.
 
 In June, Indian Railways resumed wagon orders — 3,000 from Texmaco to be delivered in the current year.
 
 
 The Texmaco management believes that this is just the beginning and is already seeing big demand, not only from the government but also from the private sector. 

 With a capacity of 10,000 wagons, it has a 25% market share and is the only company in India with an in-house engineering department. “We are likely to get an order for 1,000 wagons from defence services in the next one month for moving tankers and artillery,” chief financial officer AK Vijay told ET. 

 Vijay was also upbeat on passenger coaches. “The present capacity of the railways cannot meet the demand for passenger coaches. We have supplied the prototype to Indian Railways.
 
 Once approved, we will be eligible for future orders.” Demand from the private sector, which dropped to 1,000 wagons in 2013 from 5,000 earlier, is expected to rise. 

 “We have already started supplying specialised wagons to Hyundai and Ford and intend to supply to others as well. Going ahead, demand from the private sector will gradually improve and you will also see that white goods will also be transported by rail,” Vijay said. 

 In addition to this, the recent acquisition of Kalindee Rail makes the combined entity a complete rail solutions provider.
 
 While Texmaco is present in wagon manufacturing, Kalindee is engaged in infrastructure and signaling.
 
 The company is also planning to enter the railway infrastructure segment, with plans to build steel castings for railway lines. 

 “The Indian railway system is in dire need of renovation and expansion. In addition to this, we are confident of securing international orders as well. Our quality of products is acceptable to the US, Australian and Scandinavian railroads,” said Vijay.
 
 Given its capacity and orders, the future looks impressive.

Textile companies' good run likely to last for another year,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/textile-companies-good-run-likely-to-last-for-another-year/articleshow/30330034.cms,m.economictimes.com,Textile companies' good run likely to last for another year,"It has been a stellar six months for India’s textiles companies. 

 A weak rupee, consistent demand from China and a buoyancy in demand in the US and European markets, have helped as textiles companies across the value chain have done well. But it is companies who are into production of raw materials, especially yarn besides production and export of garments which have recorded a higher growth in revenues. 

 
Rally could well run for a year 

 So will the rally in textile stocks on the back of the buoyancy in the sector, be sustained? It well could for perhaps a year, especially for companies who manufacture garments and yarn. 

 Here’s why: Yarn-and-garment-manufacturing companies reported a revenue growth ranging between 15 per cent and 53 per cent in the last six months on a year-on-year basis. Taking a cue from this, investors appear to be buying into this story. The ET Textile Index, which mirrors many textiles companies, reported returns of 47 per cent in the last six months compared with 8 per cent returns by the S&P Sensex. 

 

 There is the competitiveness of India’s textiles industry. Labour costs in Bangladesh and China are relatively high and Bangladesh , which had emerged as an alternate market to India, is also weighed down by a political strife. This could work in favour of India’s yarn, fabrics and garment manufacturing companies. 

 
Chinese demand factor and the Indian advantage 

 Besides this, the fortunes of Indian textiles companies are linked to the demand from China . Of the yarn which it produces, 30 per cent is exported to China. Demand from China for cotton yarn is expected to continue for at least one year. Thanks to various quota systems in China , companies there find import of cotton more attractive than producing or buying in their local markets. 

 In fact, to support its farmers, the Chinese government has been buying and stocking cotton at 20,400 Yuan per tonne when international cotton prices are trading at close to 15,000 Yuan per tonne. This makes Chinese cotton expensive there, forcing Chinese companies to import yarn. 

 This works well for Indian companies such as Vardhman Textiles, TT, Nahar Spinning Mills and Nitin Spinners. On the valuation front, Vardhman Textiles is placed better than most spinners. The company is trading at one year forward price to earnings multiple of 3.49 times, which is lower than its five-year average price to earnings multiple. 

 
The Benefit of a Weak Rupee 

 The weakening of the rupee has also boosted garment-manufacturing companies. Interestingly , the recovery in the US and European markets will continue to help garment-manufacturing companies such as Gokaldas Exports , Mandhana Industries, Raymond and Arvind in providing a leg-up to their business. 

 These companies are also expected do well because of the 2 per cent interest incentive offered by the Indian government on incremental exports and on an annual basis. From a valuation perspective, Arvind and Mandhana Industries are poised for better, trading at one year forward price to earnings ratio of 9.9 and 14.7 times, which are lower than their five-year price to earnings multiples.

The real reason for the market fall is that we were overbought and we needed a reason to correct, as did all other markets.

 The stock climbed 11.23 per cent to hit a high of Rs 445.05 on BSE, breaching its previous high of Rs 439.90 hit on October 20. 

 The company would sell its stake to the existing JV partner Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. The stake sale pegged the value of the joint venture company at Rs 6,305 crore. 

 L RamKumar, MD, Tube Investments, said in an interview to ET Now that his company will use the proceeds to retire debt. It would take another 2-3 months for the company to get the required approvals, the spokesperson said. The long-term debt of the company stood at Rs 1,000 crore. 

 Earlier, MM Murugappan, Chairman of Tube Investments, in a regulatory filing to BSE said, ""I am delighted that Mitsui Sumitomo is increasing its stake in Chola MS to 40 per cent. This will further strengthen our relationship with Mitui Sumitomo and help realise our vision in making Chola MS the most respected general insurer in India."" 

 Foreign partners can bring in foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 49 per cent in the insurance sector. In November, Japanese Nippon Life agreed to buy an additional 23 per cent stake in Reliance Life Insurance for Rs 2,265 crore.

 This may trigger valuation re-rating of the residual stake in the insurance venture as well as bring down its debt burden. The combined positive impact of these two factors lifted its stock 11.62% on Monday, the highest one-day percentage change since September 2014, to end at Rs 446.6. There are two factors that might help analysts to lift their target price on the stock. 

 One, the company will receive nearly Rs 882 crore post selling 14% stake in the insurance company. This will be used to retire the debt of the company and consequently, bring down the interest expense by nearly half. 

 At the end of FY15, the company has a total debt of Rs 1,420 crore, and is expected to receive net proceeds of Rs 750-800 crore from stake sale after deduction in capital gains. 

 De Arul Kaarthick, analyst with Karvy stock broking says that the interest cost of Tube Investments will come down to Rs 79 crore for the next fiscal versus Rs 122 crore this year. The company’s profit margin for the next year may improve by 120-150 basis points. 

 Secondly, after selling 14% stake, Tube Investments will still own 60% in the insurance firm. Given that the current deal is valued at 8.46x the book value, much lower than currently factored by the analyst, the revised valuation for general insurance could set higher valuation benchmark of the remaining stake and could potentially trigger valuation rerating of the insurance company.

  MUMBAI: Stocks of Uttar Pradesh-based sugar firms like Balrampur Chini, Bajaj Hindusthan and Dwarikesh rose on Wednesday on hopes of investor-friendly sugar policies in the state.
   
  Sugar companies and their investors have cheered the return of the Samajwadi Party to power in UP as they hope that Mulayam Singh’s dream of making the state India’s largest sugar producer will result in the new government offering fresh sops or reviving its old pro-industry investment policy.
   
  Shares of sugar companies, with large operations in UP, rose early on Tuesday as it became clear that the Samajwadi Party was heading to form a government in Lucknow, but profit-booking during the later part of the day in an overall volatile market saw sugar stocks end in the red.
   
  At 11:00 a.m., leading producer Bajaj Hindusthan was trading 2.4% higher at Rs 34.20, while Dhampur Sugar Mills rose 2.3% to Rs 40.90 and Dwarikesh Sugar was marginally higher at Rs 42.00 on the BSE.
   
  In the broader market, the BSE barometer Sensex was trading marginally lower at 17,169, while the 50-share Nifty index was up 0.05% 5224.
   
  According to an ET report, UP chief minister Mulayam Singh had announced a scheme in 2004 that gave generous incentives like capital subsidy, entry tax exemption, and reimbursement of transport cost, stamp duty, registration charges and purchase tax for 5-10 years to sugar companies investing above Rs 350 crore.
   
  Attracted by the scheme, between 2005 and 2007, companies such as Bajaj Hindusthan, Balrampur Chini, Uttam Group, Dwarikesh, Triveni, Parle, DSCL, Dhampur, Triveni, Rana Sugar, Simbhaoli Sugar, and Dalmiya invested more than Rs 5,000 crore in 28 new plants and expansion projects.

  For a genuine long-term contrarian investor who does not bother looking at things, this is one of the greatest bottoming out opportunity in sugar stocks. If you are a trader, they are just moving within a range of Rs 5-10 which nakes it extremely difficult to trade within such a narrow range.
   
  But let me just say that sugar is bottoming out for the long term and anybody who can seriously hold these stocks will benefit.

 At 09:40 a.m.; Bajaj Hindustan was trading 6.8 per cent higher at 13.97, followed by Oudh Sugar Mills Ltd which was up 8.8 per cent to Rs 17.30. Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd was up 3.9 per cent and Mawana Sugar was trading 4.6 per cent higher.
 
 The fate of Uttar Pradesh's Rs 35,000-crore sugar industry, which is the sole and largest agriculture-based industry, hinges on one decision - the price of sugarcane, ET reported.
 
 Though the chief minister is likely to send the state-advised price of cane to the Cabinet on November 25, things have already turned sour for the sugar industry and cane farmers.
 
 According to the ET report, typically, governments in UP have favoured farmers when it comes to deciding the cane price, with the intention of garnering their votes.
 
 Also, given the steep increases that previous chief minister Mayawati had implemented in cane price (SAP), Akhilesh Yadav would feel constrained to do so. State authorities indicated that cane price this season also would depend largely on the escalation in the input cost for farmers over the years.

  What is the call on HCL Tech in the entire IT space right now? 
  
  Shiv Nadar wants to raise some money for their charitable trust. So to that extent, one should not read too much into this sale. Yes, since it was a block deal, so it was done at a discount but there have been a lot of research reports which have been recommending a buy on HCL Technologies. 
  
  We understand that they have got a very diversified revenue stream as far as main company is concerned and they are quoting at a significant discount to all the majors like Infosys or Wipro. So to that extent, I do believe that this fall should be taken as an opportunity to buy into the counter.

"UTI truly independent, IPO to strengthen this character: Leo Puri",positive,https://m.economictimes.com/uti-truly-independent-ipo-to-strengthen-this-character-leo-puri/articleshow/48249727.cms,m.economictimes.com,"UTI truly independent, IPO to strengthen this character: Leo Puri","MUMBAI: Asserting that UTI Mutual Fund is the only large independent asset manager in the country, its chief Leo Puri has said that the fund house's proposed IPO will further strengthen this character. 

 ""We are very proud to be an independent asset manager. We are the only large asset manager which is not controlled by a corporate or a bank. This gives us a unique position in terms of being an independent financial institution,"" Puri said. 

 The country's oldest fund house, which manages assets worth over USD 15 billion, is planning to launch an Initial Public Offer (IPO) and would be the country's first asset management company to go public. 

 ""One of the benefits I see from our IPO is that it will strengthen our character as an independent asset manager,"" Puri told PTI in an interview here. 

 Listing out the benefits in this regard, Puri said a large number of retail investors after the IPO, along with a professional management and a board-governed structure, would make it further answerable to the market for its performance. 

 ""We certainly should be answerable and transparent and people should be able to ask us how we are doing and what we are doing. We would like to be positioned that way. It will keep us on our toes,"" he added. 

 Puri said that UTI Mutual Fund is an asset manager today in entirety. UTI Mutual Fund was carved out of the erstwhile Unit Trust of India as a mutual fund in February 2003. 

 It is promoted by the four of the largest public sector financial institutions as sponsors -- SBI, LIC, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank. These four each hold 18.5 per cent stake in UTI Asset Management Company, while US-based fund house T Rowe Price has acquired a 26 per cent stake. 

 ""We are no longer a conglomerate. We are not the old UTI which was promoting exchanges and other entities,"" he said, while adding that the institution is very proud of the role it played in the past but that phase is over now. 

 ""That phase of India's history is done and today it is much more important to focus and excel in what you do. We are asset manager in broad sense and that is what we want to excel at,"" he said. 

 Talking about the benefits that an independent character bring in, Puri said it gives you greater credibility and ensures that there are no conflicts of interest, in comparison to others promoted by business houses or even banks. 

 ""There is nothing to conflict us in terms of how we run our operations or how we influence the governance of the companies. The two roles of an asset manager are to allocate capital and to influence governance. 

 ""The best asset managers across the world are the independent ones, because these two functions ideally and even from a systemic point of view are best carried out by a company that has got a broad-based ownership and board governance, as opposed to being subsidiarised. 

 ""I think our markets will mature in that direction also, but UTI is already there as a role model of what you could build,"" he added.

ET Now: Do you think the selling in IT is still not complete?
 
 
Arindam Ghosh: In couple of quarters going forward, we can definitely see some of the IT companies both frontline and the mid-tier to come under some pressure.
 
 But overall, we must remember that the recovery in the US and European markets is going to be quite strong this year. This will definitely counterbalance or offset to a certain extent any kind of adverse movement in currency.
 
 One should therefore continue to have or utilise these opportunities to buy into these IT companies as and how the earnings or results keep coming out over the next two quarters.
 
 One must also keep a fair balance between export-led and domestic-led. So, this cannot be a situation where you get into a complete swing trade and build your portfolio on the basis of domestic cyclicals and completely ignore the export-led companies.
 
 It is a careful and calibrated rebalancing which needs to be done keeping in mind a whole lot of factors like the election outcome.
 
 Of course, we have to see beyond the elections on how the fundamentals and various dynamics like growth, inflation and interest rates play out.

The company’s net sales dropped 18% - with cigarette sales impacted by aggressive price increases taken by the company to pass on the additional tax burden. At 27.5%, the operating profit margin dropped almost 200 bps y-o-y. The net profit dropped over 5% from the year ago level. 

 According to a report by Anand Rathi after the results, the company’s cigarette volumes in the March quarter fell 15% y-o-y and for FY13 they were down 12%. The company has rolled out 64mm cigarettes at Rs 2 and Rs 2.50. There has been no change in excise duty on cigarettes of less than 65mm. 

 With aggressive price hikes in all premium cigarettes, 64mm cigarettes are expected to gain market share. According to the report, VST’s brands Charms and Charminar, which are at low end of the cigarette market, may gain market share in 64mm cigarettes on any down-trading from premium cigarettes. 

 According to a post-results report by ICICI Securities, the 64 mm category of cigarettes contributed ~8% to the company’s volumes. The volume share of this category is expected to increase considering the second consecutive year of excise hikes in Budget 2013. 

 The company has a strategy to pass on any excise hikes and concentrate on low price cigarettes with those categories, which do not attract high duty. VST fetches similar margins in 64 mm and 69 mm categories. The company has increased its payout to 76%, which yields a dividend of 4% at current price. 

 With the strong balance sheet and healthy return ratios, analysts believe the stock is trading at attractive valuation multiples.

Westlife raises Rs 180 cr via preferential issue of shares,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/westlife-raises-rs-180cr-via-preferential-issue-of-shares/articleshow/21276771.cms,m.economictimes.com,Westlife raises Rs 180cr via preferential issue of shares,"MUMBAI: BSE-listed Westlife Development today said it has raised Rs 180 crore through preferential issue of shares to Arisaig India Fund, following the Bombay High Court's nod for merging Hardcastle Restaurants (HR) as its direct subsidiary. 

 Hardcastle Restaurants is the master franchisee for west and south India operations of McDonald's Restaurants. 

 ""The funds raised through the preferential allotment will be used to invest in the growth of our business, aggressively increase our retail footprint. We plan to add 75-100 restaurants in FY'14 and FY'15,"" Westlife Development vice-chairman Amit Jatia told PTI. 

 Westlife will allot a total of 54.04 lakh fully paid equity shares to Arisaig India Fund Ltd, amounting to 3.47 per cent stake in the company. 

 The preferential allotment to Arisaig will have a lock-in period of one year from the date of allotment. 

 The Scheme of Arrangement involves the consolidation of BL Jatia group companies, HR (through its majority shareholder, Triple A Foods), and Westpoint Leisureparks (majority shareholder of Triple A Foods), under Westlife Development Ltd, Jatia said. 

 The BL Jatia family holds majority ownership in these companies. As a consequence of the merger of the companies, the equity base of Westlife Development would expand to 15 crore shares. 

 ""This is Westlife in a new form. The new shares will be listed on the BSE and we hope this will get done in the next three weeks. This will increase liquidity for us and help us keep our expansion plans on track,"" he said. 

 Arisaig India Fund is a registered Singapore headquartered FII and part of Arisaig Partners, a fund management company with USD 5 billion in assets across emerging markets. 

 Westlife reported consolidated revenues of Rs 684.3 crore in FY'13, riding on a strong revenue growth of 25 per cent of its subsidiary, Hardcastle Restaurants.

I mean after today’s sell off in the initial part, it almost seems like post Reliance’s numbers, sentiment turned around. Have those numbers had a negative surprise, market was sure to go down further from these levels?The irony about the whole market situation is that at 5200+, we are like superstars and at sub-5000, we are like untouchables. So from that point of view, one needs to keep shoulder on head and if one does not want to think about tomorrow or may be about one week or a fortnight, then it is definitely time to cherry pick valuations. Of course 4 or 5% down, much does not really mean in terms of downtick in terms of valuation but it does call for 25-30% selective stock picks because there has been stock specific moves in the market. So rather than trading Nifty or Sensex like I said earlier, it makes sense to cherry pick on some of these stocks and sectors. How are you placing Bharti at this point?We have been a contrarian call as far as the entire telecom is concerned. Most of the experts have been cautious on the telecom pack but we feel instead of saying it from a one or two quarter basis, give it a little bit more stretched out time horizon, 'yes’ because of tariff wars, the ARPUs will come under pressure. Revenues profitability will be affected but if you think beyond six months, eight months to a year time, 3G penetration and of course the rural expansion will add on to the bottom-line of most of the cellular frontline companies. So on that point of view, the top choice remains Bharti. Post that, RComm and then possibly Idea. Again your subscriber base is going to improve month on month, there is no doubt about it but in the near term at least two quarters, you will see a kind of a contraction in the profitability of the company. So we are not talking about three to six months but definitely one year plus, we would look at lower levels to buy into telecom.Realty also as a space down about 2% and no surprises there really. That entire pocket, how would you approach it now?Very selective and it is still reflecting what we saw about two months back, market performs good, you have real estate being a superhero and if the markets are bad, definitely it is going to be one of the underdogs. I would possibly look at the new boy on the block that’s Godrej Properties. So that company, the real estate pack, looks a little bit more attractive. HDIL, DLF, Unitech. Mahindra Lifespaces incidentally is another one that one should keep on the radar because that possibly will have an uptake and the recent ruling, the FSI from 2.2 to 2.5 to about 3 is going to have a lot of buildings coming under redevelopment. That will be a big positive.In terms of the metal stocks, especially there was a lot of profit booking that came into the market, especially on JSW Steel and Hindalco? How are you placing these stocks at this point in time?The entire metal gamut I would rather look out for steel and copper. These will be the two first preferences and then possibly zinc to a certain extent. Aluminium, however, I would avoid for a certain time because of the volatility in the aluminium prices. The margins keep on fluctuating to a great extent but ‘yes’ steel. If you just want to elaborate a little bit further, the infrastructure focus that’s going to go will definitely have offtake of cement and steel both because these are the two core raw materials that go into making a good infrastructure. So from that point of view, forget about exports. Domestically itself, the consumption could possibly go up by 10-12% and that will provide opportunities for steel manufacturers and we are quite optimistic about it.How are you taking a look at Hindustan Copper?Too much of hype actually over there and one will definitely want to wait to create any kind of new positions. Now if you would have possibly got invested at lower levels, then definitely stay put but this entire gamut of PSU stocks running up in terms of valuation and at what valuation is the issue going to come is going to be a big question mark. If it is nowhere near what the market expects, then you will see a heavy sell off. So at these kinds of run-ups of roundabout 10-15-20%, I would definitely avoid, wait for it to cool off a little bit and then possibly get into it.L&T numbers disappointed the street. ICICI Bank did not match expectations. Reliance surprised on the positive. What do you make of these numbers?If you put the whole thing in perspective, it would be a little bit inappropriate to judge Q3 numbers and the overall performance for the entire year. Yes, Q3 has been bad and rightly so. All the managements that came and spoke on the various media including ICICI Bank, L&T, ONGC were quite vocal enough that Q3 has had its own problems.Going forward and slipping into Q4, problems are not going go last for all that long and definitely there is going to be brighter days to see going forward from hereon. So from that point of view, opportunity does exist in counters like L&T, ICICI Bank, ONGC and BHEL including Reliance Industries to find value at lower levels and we feel that one-odd quarter in the four quarters, Q3 being negative does not spell negativity for the entire year.By the time we end the financial year, Q4 will definitely bring out some cheerful times and numbers to speak about and that will speak for itself from a longer term perspective. So I am quite optimistic that capital goods engineering going forward will definitely deliver.What’s your sense?I would look at mid-cap players and one of the mid-caps that has been a hit was the Chettinad Cement stock that we spoke a while back. Other than that, we are looking at Shree Cement. We are looking at Keshoram and we are looking at Birla. These are some of the mid-cap cement ideas that we are a little bit positive about. Yes, there was a lot of talk about excess capacity coming in and of course the demand-supply really not going in favour of demand and oversupply coming in and that would possibly have a negative impact. But infrastructure is going to drive both steel and cement going forward. So I am a little bit more optimistic.Chettinad, you recommended the stock when it was much lower than the current valuations, you are right now. At 592, would you still go ahead and buy it?I would not want to bite the dust over there honestly speaking because that’s the kind of target that we were speaking about from a little bit stretched out time horizon. At 590+, it would be like catching the hot iron. What’s the overall call on the oil and gas space?Well ‘yes’, it has been under pressure but we like again the mid-cap players over there, may be something like a Cairn India or a Selan, Shiv-Vani Oil. Definitely there are opportunities over there. Hindustan Oil Exploration is also there. On the other hand, I would use opportunities to exit at higher levels and on the flipside, ONGC the big weight, definitely sub-1100 will be a good level to possibly look at ONGC from a long-term perspective. Like I have mentioned earlier, Q4 and next fiscal will be definitely better for most of the companies, which have been a little bit negative in Q3 this fiscal. What do you think, 1150 in terms of PAT, almost trebling of profits?Yeah and when we were speaking about metal, zinc was one other commodity that I mentioned and ‘yes’, definitely going forward from hereon, we will see better margins over there. So we are quite optimistic about it. Of course, there are hardly any players in this particular field but an odd one out, Hindustan Zinc, may be after the initial euphoria cools off, definitely one can look at Hindustan Zinc.1180, would you buy it or would you wait for a lower level?We saw the stock hovering around 500 or 600 if I am not mistaken in bad times, then climbed up to 1300 if I am not mistaken and you have seen a little bit of a cool off over there. Sub-1100 will be comfortable to look at it.Would that be an avoid for you as well, Dish TV?Yes and I do not think life beyond 54-55 looks quite possible for Dish TV. The entire gamut, the DTH, there are a lot of policies that needs a clarification to come through. You have huge competition from the unorganised cable operators. So from that point of view, I would definitely give it a pass, better sectors, better shares to look at if you really want to get invested from a long-term timeframe.Fortis - the kind of growth that we have seen in the quarter, does that take you by surprise?It does take me by surprise but if you ask me whether I take a buy call on the entire healthcare, I would definitely avoid. I really do not think that kind of uptick is going to be there on a sustainable basis. So I would rather give a run. Of course, there is going to be a huge consolidation that one speaks about in the entire healthcare space. So I would definitely avoid it as of time being and may be look at it as the news unfolds and possibly in the next couple of quarters if there is going to be a buyable kind of a situation.What about Allahabad Bank and Corporation Bank especially?Corporation Bank I believe we have a buy as a disclosure. Our clients might be holding the position but Allahabad Bank, I would wait for a little bit of correction. Yes, there has been this great liking towards the small and regional PSU banks on the fallback of this great event that will unfold over a period of time but I would look at UCO Bank, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank more aggressively rather than Allahabad Bank. Corporation Bank, yes, definitely a buy.Coming to the auto component pack, especially some of those tyre companies, Ceat and Apollo Tyres. Which from these do you like?Actually I will go with MRF because with the kind of market share. Of course it is a little bit highly priced share but definitely looks more attractive. In terms of commodity prices, rubber, they are better placed compared to its peers and of course the fact that it has got its product in the entire range of tyres that they have. So from that point of view, I would rather go in for MRF and in the other auto ancillary pack, Clutch Auto and Sona Koyo are the other two that I would possibly look at. Of course, they are a very limited choice as of now because the entire story depends upon how the entire auto sector is going to unfold over a period of time. The positive impact of auto sector unfolding and the effect coming on to auto ancillary is going to take a while.What about Asian Paints? There is a lot of institutional interest given with the float or the shares traded in the market are not as much for the public. Do you like the paints business? Yeah and with the kind of number of revival of real estate, that will spell opportunity for these kinds of frontline paint manufacturing companies. Of course like you rightly mentioned, there is not much of liquidity, so not one of the favourites amongst the players. Another thing is that Asian Paints does his own act. It really does not react with what market has to do. From that point of view, somebody who has a lot of time has patience definitely looks attractive. But these kinds of levels, if you ask me, I would not mind deploying a portion of my investible amount - may be about 15-20% definitely calls for it. Relative strength in IT and do you want to play along with that?Yes, I would definitely and we have a buy report on Mahindra Satyam. We have a buy report on HCL Tech. Tech Mahindra was the third one that we have a buy report.  What are the targets in Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam?To put a figure will be difficult but from a percentage point of view, if you have 4-6 months time horizon, definitely you will have at least 5-10% upside in all the three stocks that I just mentioned.Do you think balancing of the portfolio would require something like an HDFC also, given that the stock is not cheap but consistency of performance in growth continues for that one?Yes, I think so and with the kind of numbers that HDFC came out with, a stellar set of numbers. The NPOs below one per cent that also is a good strength that the company speaks about. Going forward, we do expect and we did touch upon the real estate sector and we expect the revival already coming into stream and definitely that is visible in cities like Pune, Hyderabad, Secunderabad twin cities, Bangalore, Mumbai. Residential properties are definitely going to have an uptake more than the commercial ones and from that point of view, a loan offtake is going to improve. If we talk about the recovery and the revival of this recession that we were in and then possibly going ahead, I do not think one should avoid HDFC in the portfolio.What would be your quick call for Monday morning given the way we shut today?I think all is not lost. I think 4930 would be the level to watch out for, but with the 4% dip. If you have a little bit of dip on Monday morning, I would definitely use opportunity to get into the market rather than run away from it."

My sense is that we will evolve into a range which could still be significant but we are somewhere right now in the middle of the range. So, buying into the index may not be a very good idea. 5270-5250 is my most preferred buying level for the Nifty but on the stock side, there will be lot of action. A lot of defensive stocks have started doing very well. So, maybe this sector could possibly rule the roost as the market becomes slightly more tentative towards the event which is there on Friday. So, we will keep trading on the stock specific side.

Ashwani Gujral: If you take the rupee rally to be the genuine bull market I believe rupee may correct down to 58, and if that happens chances are Nifty, even if temporarily, will go beyond 6000. So, this would qualify as a pause, today’s low is 5858. So 5860 which has been a strong resistance on the upside, chances are 5850-5860 should act like a good support. 

 There is more rally to come now before that whether there is a three day pause or five day pause or two day pause that time will tell but this is not the right level to turn for the market and if it does it will be a signal but just in the usual course the expectation should be that we will turn somewhere above 6000 not right here.

  What is the target price on this one LT Foods?
   
  The first target would be closer to around 85. Possibly, we would look for a break out also above 85. If you have that kind of horizon - possibly 3 or 4 months - then you could look for targets of 110 or so. But right now, I think from a pure trading perspective 85 should be a good target for this one.

  So I think that could give you a good return over the next 2-3 years. Its like a dark horse and otherwise I would go with the steady stock like Biocon where you have everything going for it.

Net profit rose to Rs 1,666.7 crore fromRs 1,408.9 crore a year earlier, in line with expectations. 

 “Over the last three quarters, profitability of the bank was helped by repatriation of profits from international subsidiaries which could further aid earnings,’’ said Rahul Shah, vicepresident, equity advisory group, Motilal Oswal Securities. “The bank had guided for gross stress addition of Rs 6,500 crore for FY15. Any revision in the same remains critical.’’ 

 Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and expended, increased 16% toRs 3,310 crore from Rs 2,865 crore. 

 The bank’s loan portfolio grew 16% to Rs 2.3 lakh crore at the end of the June quarter. “While we have been hoping that the economic revival will kick in, we expect it to come in the fiscal year 2016. 

 The bank will continue to see credit growth of 20%, better than the system,’’ said Somnath Sengupta, executive director and head, corporate centre. 

 Other income, a key driver in the last few quarters, remained lacklustre. 

 Other income, comprising fees, trading profit and miscellaneous income, declined 5% toRs 1,691 crore from Rs 1,781 crore. 

 This was mainly due to an 80% drop in the amount of placement and debt syndication issues handled in the quarter. However, given the recent revival in capital market activity, fee income may pick up in the next few quarters. 

 “With the change in improvement, capital market activity is looking up. Axis Capital is doing well. We managed six out of the nine qualified institutional placements that hit the market,’’ said Shikha Sharma, managing director and chief executive officer of Axis Bank. Asset quality was a disappointment. 

 Gross non-performing assets increased to 1.3% from 1.2% in the March quarter, failing to meet expectations of an improvement. Net NPAs also deteriorated a tad to 0.44% from 0.35%. Despite the rise in nonperforming loans, provisions during the quarter were down 46% to Rs 387 crore from Rs 712 crore. 

 However, lower fresh restructuring was a comforting factor this time. This stood at Rs 480 crore, the lowest in the last five quarters. 

 The bank is also keen to explore the issue of infrastructure bonds to fund.

  Leading cement companies have stepped up dispatches in view of the peak construction season, which is under way, and strong demand. Also, firms such as ACC and Ambuja Cements, which had expanded their capacity during the last calendar year, are reporting strong output growth now. 
  
  The combined cement dispatches of leading producers - Holcim-controlled ACC and Ambuja Cements, and Aditya Birla group's UltraTech - grew 8% year-on-year to 7.7 million tonnes in February, compared with 5.4% during April to January, FY12. 
  
  The combined capacity of ACC, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech stood at nearly 108 million tonnes at the end of the December 2011 quarter. The Indian cement industry's total capacity is expected to top 326 million tonnes at the end of FY12, say reports. 
  
  On an all-India basis, total cement dispatches grew 9.7% Y-o-Y in February and 6.5% during the April-to-February period of the current fiscal, according to brokerage reports. Increased cement output during February has also pushed up industry utilisation levels to 81%, higher on a Y-o-Y basis, say analysts. 
  
  The Union Budget's focus on developing infrastructure and on affordable and rural housing should provide a boost to cement demand over the next few quarters. 
  
  However, the new excise duty structure is estimated to put an additional burden of nearly 3 per cement bag on companies, say analysts, but this could be partially offset by the removal of basic customs duty on coal. This is because the industry meets nearly one-fourth of its coal requirements from overseas sources. 
  
  Cement companies are expected to review their prices shortly, to protect their operating margins. The new rail freight rates announced in the first week of March would lead to a nearly 20% rise in cost for cement companies, say analysts. 
  
  
 
  
 
  Cement prices have already shown an uptrend (excluding the impact of the measures announced in Union budget). For instance, in Mumbai, prices are at 320 per bag, a rise of 35 per bag in this calendar year. 
  
  Investors, however, remain optimistic on the growth prospects of this sector, with ACC, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech Cement trading not too far from their recent 52-week highs. 
  
  ACC trades at a consolidated P/E of nearly 19.1 times on a trailing four-quarter basis and appears expensive

 At $2.3 billion ( Rs 14,200 crore), sales grew 6.7% sequentially, driven by faster revival in demand for technology outsourcing services in the US, which makes up more than three-fourths of Cognizant's sales. As against the company's guidance of 4.1%, analysts were expecting sales to expand about 4.5% during the July-September period.
 
 
  The New Jersey-based company also said in the year to December, it now expects sales to grow at least 20.3% from ""at least 19%"" earlier. This is the second time the company is revising its full-year forecast upwards. Industry body Nasscom has projected India's $75-billion (Rs Rs 4.6 lakh crore) software services export sector to grow 12-14% during the current financial year.
 
 After strong performances from India's top IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies, which grew above market estimates, Cognizant's results are being seen as indicative of a sustainable turnaround for the industry.
 
 In the September quarter, larger rival TCS' sales grew 5.4% while Infosys revenues rose 3.8%. Cognizant's better-than-expected performance follows a 7% sequential growth - fastest among tier-one technology services companies - in the April-June quarter. Net income during the quarter was $320 million while operating profit margin was 19% of revenues. ""The key highlight of last quarter was that discretionary spends had grown materially faster at 8.6% compared to just 5.3% in maintenance activities. Continuation of such a trend will be considered an incremental positive and bears better implication for other discretionary-heavy peers like Infosys,"" said Kuldeep Kaul, lead analyst for IT services at ICICI Securities.
 
 Discretionary projects refer to desirable, but not necessary technology spending that corporations withdraw during bad times.
 
 Cognizant is also benefitting from higher spending in the healthcare industry, especially as the US is in the middle of implementing the Affordable Healthcare Act, or Obamacare. The company has won a contract related to the Chicago health exchange. The healthcare industry vertical, which brought in about $600 million during the quarter, grew the fastest at 11%.
 
 The company said it increased its tally of strategic clients by seven to 236. Cognizant counts a client as strategic when it has the potential to ramp up to at least $5 million in annual revenues. The total number of active clients was 1,133 at the end of September.
 
 The tuck-in acquisitions the company has been doing over the past few quarters have also helped it bolster its service offerings and geographic presence. It recently acquired France-based Equinox Consulting, a financial services consulting firm for an undisclosed amount, apart from the previous acquisitions of ValueSource, a subsidiary of Belgium-based KBC group and six companies of Germany's C1 group. It added 2,100 employees during the quarter, taking the headcount to 166,400 at the end of September.

ET Now: What is your call on the index? Also, give us your stock-specific recommendations for the day. 

 
Ashwani Gujral: The holiday was good, and let us say that markets are in choppy waters. We had said that you will have upswings and downswings, and I do not think much has changed from 7400 to 7850. 

 First we went up, then came down. Again we went up. So, that process continues. 

 possibly this range will narrow down. The month of August could have further narrow ranges before the market has a clear breakout on either side. The technology stocks may again see narrow range-bound moves before retesting previous highs. 

 Between 10000 and 10500, you could have some ranging action. Bank Nifty may be bound between 14950 and about 15600-15650. So, it is basically a pause after many months of rallies. 

 Now you could have a couple of months where the market might take to a slow phase. Basically, the defensives will do well, as will pharma, IT and FMCG. 

 The next leg of the rally has to be led by cyclicals. Until that happens, we will keep hanging around, going up 400 points or coming down 500 points from time to time. According to me, that should be the course of action.

Ranbaxy reported a net profit of Rs 478 crore in the quarter ended September 30, exceeding expectations, as it swung from a year-earlier loss of Rs 454 crore. 

 The management of the company being acquired by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said it has got a marketshare of more than 30% for valsartan in the US in an investor call after announcing the results. Ranbaxy has a six-month period during which it can market valsartan exclusively before others are allowed to sell the generic. 

 The stock rose 6.11% to Rs 634.10 on the BSE on Tuesday and also triggered a 4.31% rise in Sun Pharma, which is acquiring Ranbaxy in an all-stock deal worth $4 billion. Ranbaxy’s sales rose 16.3% toRs 3,260 crore from Rs 2,802 crore in the year ago. It said sales in India rose 12%, and that overall profit was helped by higher revenue in Western Europe. 

 ""For the quarter, the company posted results better than expected on the net sales and profit front, mainly driven by the 180-day exclusivity of valsartan,"" said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice president, Angel Broking. 

 The company is looking to gain a similar advantage with another drug, although this has been delayed. ""At the moment, we believe that we maintain the marketing exclusivity opportunity on generic Nexium and will launch the product on approval,"" Ranbaxy CEO Arun Sawhney said on the investor call. 

 The company was scheduled to launch the generic version of the second-best selling drug in the US in late May, but has failed to do so. Analysts expect Ranbaxy to earn $180-250 million in the first six months if it manages to successfully launch generic Nexium in the US. 

 Ranbaxy is working to resolve quality issues that led to the US Food and Drug Administration banning imports of all drugs from the company's four Indian plants at Mohali, Toansa, Dewas and Paonta Sahib. Without giving details, the management indicated that the Mohali plant could be the first to be remediated. 

 On the many senior level exits that the company has faced in the US this month, Sawhney said, ""Exits do take place in companies. We have sufficient depth in the management and enough people to take care of US operations."" 

 Earlier this month, Ranbaxy agreed to pay $39.75 million to settle litigation related to the manner in which it historically reported pricing data to Texas Medicaid, the US healthcare programme for people with low incomes. 

 That came after the drugmaker pleaded guilty last year to felony charges relating to drug safety and agreed to pay $500 million in civil and criminal fines under a settlement with the US Department of Justice.

FII exit will not hurt Nifty as retail investors take charge,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fiis-exit-will-not-hurt-nifty-as-retail-investors-take-charge/articleshow/40504754.cms,m.economictimes.com,FIIs' exit will not hurt Nifty as retail investors take charge,"MUMBAI: The Nifty is at an all-time high, thanks to short-term liquidity inflows by foreign institutional investors and as domestic investors have turned net buyers in the last couple of months. 

 FIIs have been positive on Indian equities, but if they pull out money because of global risks, that would have a negative impact on the market. 

 For those who are concerned of a sharp fall in the market if FIIs pull out US dollars in case the US increases interest rates, there is hope from domestic investors. 

 The retail investors, who had burnt their fingers in the 2008 crash, are slowing returning back to equities. 

 According to the Association of Mutual Funds of India, domestic funds have received Rs 20,784 crore since the beginning of the year, reaching the highest level in July over the past 78 months. 

 ""We believe that strong inflows of $3.3 billion into equity MFs over the past three months and the expectations of its continuation may help temper the impact of any large FII outflows, following signals of US rate normalisation and the USD strength,"" said a Deutsche Bank report. 

 According to analysts, a lot of investors, who were waiting on the sidelines for the election outlook, have started coming in, but the real big retail money has still not come in a big way. 

 ""Investors normally look at the past three years return in any asset class before they really come in a big way and equities have now given good returns for the last one year. Going by that track record, we should see decent flows coming in the next one or two years and that will be good in terms of balancing out the FII flows,"" said Mahesh Patil, Co-CIO, Birla Sunlife MF, to ET Now. 

 The domestic participation picking up is largely because India now has advantage of a stable government, the policy environment is a lot more conducive, macroeconomic fundamentals have improved significantly and business confidence is getting restored. 

 ""We continue to be in an envious position as opposed to other emerging market economies, whether it is Brazil or whether it is China. Our growth and economic activity is slowly starting to bottom out and we are again inching closer to easing of the monetary cycle,"" said Arindam Ghosh, CEO, BlackRidge Capital Advisors. 

 If the foreign investors stay put and the retail participation increases, Indian markets may see a phenomenal rise. 

 ""This constant net buying of foreigners has been a feature. The competing factor this year will be the locals returning to the market. I do not see the foreigners wanting to reduce their position. So the markets look technically very attractive,"" said Adrian Mowat, Chief EM & Asian Equity Strategist. 

 Retail investors are known to take positions in broader markets. With the sharp surge in mid-and-small caps in the past few months, analysts are advising retail investors to be selective in stock buying approach. 

 ""They need to get a little selective when it comes to taking exposure. Some of the stocks have run up quite significantly. They should stick to large caps, quality midcaps, and fundamentally sound companies over the next three-four years,"" Ghosh added.

Finolex on a roll after renewing its focus on pipe business,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/finolex-on-a-roll-after-renewing-its-focus-on-pipe-business/articleshow/30757502.cms,m.economictimes.com,Finolex on a roll after renewing its focus on pipe business,"Two years of stagnation and margin erosion forced India’s top PVC pipes and fittings maker, Finolex Industries, to reinvent itself to stage a comeback.
 
 The company not only recovered its profits in FY13 to FY10 levels, but further doubled them in the April-December ’13 period. Its market capitalisation has nearly tripled over the past one year, signalling that things are on the mend.
 
 The company’s problems in the past emanated from its huge exposure to the commodity PVC business, which it entered as part of a backward integration course. But now there is a renewed focus on pipes, which was its main forte.
 
 “We will end FY14 with a capacity of 230,000 tonnes of pipes against 270,000 tonne of PVC resin capacity,” Saurabh Dhanorkar, managing director of the company told ET.
 
 The company plans to add another 100,000-tonne pipes capacity over the next three years,” he said. Simultaneously, Finolex is trying to improve margins in the pipes business, where it enjoys a strong brand value.
 
 “In the last six quarters, we have slowly increased the prices of our PVC pipes to raise margins from 5% to 8%, with a plan to take them to 10%,” Dhanorkar said. This has clearly reflected in the company’s improved margins in the past few quarters.
 
 The decision to reduce its foreign exchange exposure and to hedge, after seeing the impact on its earnings in the past, has also helped.
 
 “We used to take 360 days credit from overseas suppliers in the past, which was unhedged, exposing us to great foreign exchange volatility. We cut that to 90 days now, while hedging 70% of our exposure, so we won’t have any volatility in earnings,” Dhanorkar said.
 
 The company is also set to exploit the potential in PVC fittings, which is a fast growing, high-margin business with limited competition. It has expanded its jetty in Ratnagiri to import coal, chemical as well as cryogenic cargos and set up a 43-MW captive power plant, leading to cost savings.
 
 More importantly, the company is not planning any major investments in the next couple of years.
 
 It aims to focus only on brownfield expansions at three locations — Baroda, Pune and Ratnagiri — at a substantially lower capital expenditure.
 
 According to Dhanorkar, Finolex generates over Rs 300 crore of cash annually and will become debt-free in three years. The company pared onethird of its debt in the past one year toRs 660 crore at end September ’13.
 
 The demand for PVC pipes in India appears to be rising, especially due to the vast un-irrigated agricultural land and usage in construction for plumbing and sewerage.
 
 And to tap more markets, Finolex has already set up a network of 15,000 dealers.
 
 Through all these measures, Finolex is on course to report a steady improvement in its margins even if the topline remains flattish as its current PVC resin sales get converted to more value-added pipes. However, lower capital expenditure and higher margins will result in a marked improvement in return on investment, which could signal a good longterm investment.

UR Bhat: Looks like that, because as I said in the case of IT, here also the bulk of the capital appreciation that one could derive has already happened and if there is going to be some sort of FII outflow, this is one of the big sectors which would probably get affected and on a valuation argument, it is not very strong in respect of FMCG because despite they having done very well on the stock front, valuations look a bit stretched. So at the first sign of FIIs exiting, this sector might actually give way a bit.

  NEW DELHI: GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals today said its consolidated net profit rose by 10.37 per cent to Rs 560.57 crore for the year ended December 31, 2010.

"Godawari Power & Ispat: Pellet sales, mining key drivers for company",positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/godawari-power-ispat-pellet-sales-mining-key-drivers-for-company/articleshow/15610783.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,"Godawari Power & Ispat: Pellet sales, mining key drivers for company","Higher pellet volumes and better realisations from a decent product portfolio have led to an improved performance by Godawari Power & Ispat, or GPL. In the coming quarters, pellet volumes should rise while prices stay firm.
 
 The June 2012 quarter results showed an improvement on all fronts -- consolidated net sales rose 22% and the EBIDTA grew 44.4 % YoY, mainly due to a 130% rise in pellet sales. A 15% improvement in realisations across products, except power, was also a major contributor to the stellar performance.
 
 The rise in pellet volumes owed to iron ore mines operating at a utilisation rate of over 100%. Additionally, a dip in availability of sponge iron grade ore meant that more of the iron ore the company produces could be used for pellet production.
 
 Moreover, Ardent Steel, in which the company has a 75% stake, also witnessed an improvement in utilisation rate as it overcame teething issues at its mines, which started production in the latter half of FY10.
 
 The cost of coal has been a cause of concern for the company in the past. However, its 26% stake in Nakia coalmine will ensure that the needs of its captive power unit are met. It will also hedge it from fluctuations in coal prices over the next two years.
 
 The iron mines in Boria Tibu and Dhalli Rajhara, Chhattisgarh will supplement its iron ore mines in Ari Dongri, which currently meet 70-80% of the company's iron ore requirements.
 
 Going forward, a further increase in pellet sales, including a higher 95% utilisation rate at Ardent Steel, and iron ore mining operations are going to be the value drivers for the company. The only cause of concern is the power division.
 
 A rise in coal prices, due to dependence on e-auction and imported coal, on the one hand and falling merchant power prices on the other have resulted in revenue and margins falling at the power division. The ability of the company to switch focus from the power business to steel will help it maintain the good show.
 
 The GPL stock has performed well in the past eight months, with the price appreciating by 80% from a low of Rs 69.50. However, at a price of Rs 125.50 per share, it still trades at a low PE of 1.8x and an EV/EBIDTA of 3.2x.

 Gold climbed 0.5 per cent to $1,324.52 an ounce. It reached $1,324.67 earlier, the highest since April 15. Silver also added 0.4 per cent to $20.974 an ounce, after reaching $21.03, the highest since March 18. 

 Bullion climbed 3 per cent last week as the Federal Reserve said it will keep interest rates at almost zero for a considerable time, even as it cut bond purchases for a fifth consecutive meeting as the economy improves. 

 Meanwhile, gold rose 6 per cent this month and is set for the first back-to-back quarterly gain since 2011, partly as violence in Iraq and tension in Ukraine spurred demand for a haven. Militants in Iraq extended territorial gains.

ET Now: I was asking you about the RBI norms that got released yesterday which will allow persons with banking experience or NBFCs in general to set up banks as well. What did you make of those because the NBFCs have reacted today? 

 
Dipan Mehta: That also is positive and we have been getting news flow and that come from the RBI. But these are more of long term in nature and they will take some time before they actually start having an effect on the performance of these specific NBFCs. But what we have in place is that, we have a finance minister and RBI governor both who want to make things far better for the financial services sector and to channelise savings into the capital market into financial assets. 

 So one side whatever is required to be done at the government end is being done and then RBI is also in its own way carrying out a lot of reforms. Be it allowing new bank licenses, the payment banks as they describe it or for that matter what they did as far as infrastructure funding is concerned by providing exemptions or relaxations on SLR, CRR. So both institutions, the government and the RBI, working in tandem and that is very positive per se for the banks. 

 But my sense is that banks, NBFCs are also doing better because some of the threats which were impacting, likely to impact the economy that being oil prices per se and secondly the monsoon are gradually getting dissolved. Oil prices are back to where they were about few weeks ago or few months ago and we are within reach as far as diesel pricing and diesel subsidy is concerned. That is more or less over and done with and last two-three days monsoon also progressed pretty well. So these are the two indicators which will benefit the domestic economy and once domestic economy starts doing well, then automatically banks are the best sector to benefit from that. So not just RBI and what the budget has offered to NBFCs, but the fact that the threats regarding to monsoon and oil prices has also improved the sentiment within the cyclicals.

 ""We received Rs 16 crore in dividend income from our rail subsidiary which is a public private partnership and the volumes increased by 19 per cent,"" its managing director Prakash Tulsiani told PTI. 

 The company, in which global port operator APM Terminals has a majority stake, had increased rates by 7 per cent in August last year, and the full quarter impact of the rate hike was visible in the July-September period, he said. 

 Total income increased to Rs 189.30 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, from Rs 133.60 crore for the same quarter last year. 

 On volumes front, Tulsiani said the container volumes grew 19 per cent over the last year to 194,000 standard units but declined by 4 per cent when compared with the preceding June quarter on a dip in exports. 

 The company also added two services calling at the port which pushed up the volumes, he said. 

 It witnessed a 23 per cent rise in bulk cargo handling during the quarter at 1.01 million tonnes, but Tulsiani said that this was an one-off quarter and the total bulk cargo handled by the port in the first nine months of the year is the same as last year. 

 ""With bulk cargo, you may witness one quarter when there is a rise,"" he said, adding that the port continues to maintain its cautious approach on the bulk front. 

 It can be noted that the company had surprised all by announcing a withdrawal of capacity addition on the bulk front earlier this year. It is, however, going ahead with its planned expansion on the container front. 

 Tulsiani said that the company has embarked on the USD 100 million capacity expansion on container side and is targeting to finish it by March 2016. 

 The container handling capacity will increase to 1.35 million standard units from the current 850,000 TEUs, he said.

The recent run-up seen in equity markets suggests that the markets are pricing in some probability of the BJP-led NDA leading the race, say analysts.
 
 Tracking the momentum, most of the Gujarat-based stocks have caught the fancy of investors and funds ever since the BJP announced Modi as its PM candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha election, on September 13.
 
 According to analysts, it is a prudent strategy to bet on stocks ahead of elections for short-term gains, but for long term they should look at fundamentals before taking their call.
 
 Siddharth Sedani, Vice President - PMS at Microsec Capital Ltd, is of the view that Gujarat-based companies have already run up in the last 3-6 months. Investors should bet on these companies on sentimental boost.
 
 Most of the Gujarat-based stocks have already rallied 30-170 per cent in the run up to the election results, which include names like Torrent Power, GSPL, Adani Ports, Adani Power, Adani Enterprises etc. (See table below).
 
 Adani Enterprises has been the clear winner, rallying as much as 170 per cent in a matter of just 7 months, followed by Arvind which gained 116 per cent in the same period.
 
 The BSE Sensex has rallied over 14 per cent or nearly 3000 points since September, while the 50-share Nifty index also managed to climb over 16 per cent or nearly 1000 points, as of data collected from Sep 13.
 
 The recent run-up seen in markets is supported by the hope that opinion polls are correct in pointing to a victory for the centre-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is widely perceived as more business-friendly and especially with the current chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, nominated as the party’s prime ministerial candidate.
 
 Nomura sees a 75 per cent probability of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance securing a solid enough plurality to pull together a majority coalition, under the leadership of Narendra Modi.
 
 “I think stocks based out of Gujarat are up largely on account of expectations of Modi becoming the prime minister. Chartically though some of these stocks are in a strong uptrend and can be bought for some profits in the near term,” said Kunal Saraogi, CEO at Equityrush.com.
 
 To buy into equities before the Lok Sabha election results are announced is the right strategy. Some of the Gujarat-based stocks are making fresh record highs on a daily basis, but the idea should be to pick names with sound fundamentals, say experts.
 
 “While the large cap space is sufficiently owned by FIIs, the small and mid-cap space seems to be lean in terms of institutional ownership,” said Shashank Khade, Director and Chief Equity Advisor, Entrust Family Office Investment Advisor.
 
 “I feel if a stable government is in place, there will be a rush towards capex-oriented stocks, potential beneficiaries of revival of capex cycle & renewed infrastructure thrust,” he added.
 
 
We have compiled a list of ten stocks which have shown tremendous strength since September 2013:
 
 
  
 
 Have stocks run-up ahead of fundamentals?
 
 Most experts do feel that most of the Gujarat-based stocks have certainly run-up ahead of fundamentals and some bit of corrections is expected once the results come out. So investors should tread with caution.
 
 Well, a few of the Gujarat-based companies which have strong business franchise with reasonable financial can have robust upside going forward on the positive outcome of election results.
 
 Sedani of Microsec Capital Ltd is of the view that as anticipated, the next government may bring debottlenecking and simplify policies which may propel few companies as turnaround contenders. However, how much that will help individual business, that remains to be seen.
 
 “It is true that the stock prices of the companies which have base in Gujarat are outperforming the indices, irrespective of their fundamentals,” said Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services.
 
 “However, I believe that the investors should consider the fundamentals before investing, because investments just based on speculations could badly impact the portfolio returns,” he added.
 
 A punting stock could be able to give significant returns in a very less time. However, would not be able to sustain these gains with time, exposing investor with the risk of possible loss, he explains.
 
 Analysts are not denying the fact that it could be possible that Gujarat-based stocks could report new highs. However, those which have weak fundamentals could quickly erase these gains and collapse in a similar way after the results.
 
 Before committing to any stock, investors should look at each stock based on its business fundamentals and then look at its current market price to determine whether it is undervalued or overvalued given the fundamentals, says Dr. Vikas V Gupta (Head- Research & Product Development), ArthVeda.
 
 
Top bets
 
 
Adani Enterprises: This stock has more than doubled investors’ wealth in a matter of just seven months, and analysts see the stock trending towards Rs 475 odd levels. Traders should stay put and keep revising stop losses as the stock gains further momentum.
 
 
Arvind: The stock has had a sharp uptrend in the last few months and we expect the stock to continue on the current trajectory, although may lose a bit of pace. Saraogi of Equityrush.com suggests profit booking on Arvind at the current levels.
 
 
Adani Ports: The company is one of the major contributors in infrastructure development in the past 10 years in Gujarat and analysts believe that the current run up in the stock price could be as a result of perceived favorable impact due to change in government.
 
 “The fundamentals of the company also justify stock re-rating since any favorable economic data could prove beneficial to the company due to higher growth in revenues due to manufacturing and export thrust in the medium term,” said Pendharkar of Right Horizons Financial Services.
 
 
Adani Power: This stock has also seen a sharp run in the past couple of months. However, Saraogi of Equityrush.com says that the stock faces stiff resistance around Rs 60. Traders would do well to book some profits at current levels.
 
 
SPL, Gujarat Alkalies & GMDC: These stocks look interesting based on valuations and given the fact that the equity market rally started to broaden, value buying will potentially emerge in these companies where-in the balance sheets are strong, say analysts.
 
 Apart from the above stocks, Khade of Entrust Family Office Investment Advisor says that PSU stocks are expected to be re-rated in terms of valuations on expectations of better governance of the Central government. PSU stocks and infrastructure-related stocks may get a boost due to a stable government at the Centre, he added.

 Strong government support to the stalled projects, deferment of premium payment to the government, relaxation of the exit clause for investors and modification of the model concession agreement (MCA) have improved the outlook for the roads and highways developers.
 
 This stocks have also witnessed increased interest from FIIs. Data available with NSDL showed FII exposure to the roads and highways sector has climbed to Rs 2,902 crore as of October 15 from Rs 2,622 crore at the end of 2014.
 
 Yet, analysts say the party has just begun and these stocks have way to go.
 
 In a fresh move on Wednesday, the government allowed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to compensate road developers for delays not attributable to them. This will potentially unlock investment of nearly Rs 35,000 crore in 34 stalled projects.
 
 The government has also empowered the road transport and highways ministry to approve projects with civil construction cost up to Rs 1,000 crore, taking out land cost from it to speed up decision making, said a report in Economic Times.
 
 “The announcements continue the trend of favourable policy decisions for the road space. The deferment of premium, relaxation of exit clause, modification in the model concession agreement (MCA) and the government’s support to stalled projects have already provided comfort to road sector players. We believe project awards in the road space will gather more steam going ahead,” Edelweiss Securities said in a note.
 
 The brokerage prefers contractors like KNR Constructions and developers with strong financial health, such as Sadbhav Engineering and Ashoka Buildcon.
 
 Road construction stock KNR Constructions has surged 83.10 per cent year to date compared with a 0.02 per cent drop in the BSE smallcap index and an 11 per cent fall in Nifty infrastructure index. J Kumar Infraprojects has climbed 44.22 per cent this calendar.
 
 Sadbhav Engineering, a midcap road sector stock, has surged 22 per cent during this period, while Ashoka Buildcon has risen 23 per cent.
 
 Some others have, however, fallen behind. Among them are Simplex Infrastructures (down 13.52 per cent) and IRB Infra (down 5 per cent).
 
 “Government initiatives over the past two years have increased funding and attractiveness of the sector. It has tripled the road cess (a form of tax) to $3.5 billion to boost funding for EPC projects. With many projects stuck due to land issues, it has mandated that bids are awarded only after the NHAI has procured 80 per cent of the land for build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects and 90 per cent for EPC projects,” foreign brokerage CLSA said in a note.
 
 Additionally, the government has proposed easier project exits for developers, deferment of premium payments to NHAI, decentralised project clearances and formulated a new road award model (hybrid annuity) besides offering new modes of financing, namely infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), to unclog the sector.
 
 CLSA believes asset-light E&C firms with good balance sheets and select asset owners and gatekeepers will be the key beneficiaries of these structural change in the sector. The brokerage has initiated a buy rating for J Kumar Sadbhav Engineering, and has an outperform rating for Nagarjuna.
 
 “We also highlight compelling asset owner IRB Infra. Further, non-rated KNR Construction and MBL are pure and inexpensive ideas to play the rebound in the construction cycle,” it said.

HSIL Q3 turnaround in building products division may trigger a re-rating,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hsil-q3-turnaround-in-building-products-division-may-trigger-a-re-rating/articleshow/45832820.cms,m.economictimes.com,HSIL Q3 turnaround in building products division may trigger a re-rating,"Despite an year-on-year (y-o-y) increase of 109 per cent in net profit, the market was unhappy with the second quarter performance of HSIL. It was because the company reported a 1 per cent decline in revenue from its core building products division. Its decision to exit the tiles business due to poor margins was the main reason for this fall in revenue. Efforts to reduce the trade receivables and excessive build up of inventory with the dealers was another reason for this fall. After the successful reduction in dealer inventory, the dealer despatches have re-started. Due to a good demand for its faucets, HSIL has also ramped up production at its newly-commissioned faucetware unit. Analysts are now expecting more than 20 per cent y-o-y revenue growth from the building product division in the third quarter.
 
 
  Given that the sanitaryware and faucets industry is still at a nascent stage in India—around 70 per cent of rural households don’t have decent sanitary options— the long-term demand outlook remains robust. While increased aspiration levels will drive HSILs growth in urban areas, urbanisation and a shift from joint to nuclear families will drive its rural growth. The expected pickup in the economy should also help the building products industry in the coming years.
 
 

 
 HSIL’s packaging product division continues to do well and is expected to see more than 25 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter. Packaging division’s y-o-y third quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are also expected to move up by 200 basis points due to better capacity utilisation and the impact of price hikes undertaken in the container glass division in the second quarter. Having undertaken capacity expansions, HSIL now plans to bring down its debt levels. It has already received shareholder approval to raise Rs 250 crore through equity and it is expected to be used to cut debt.
 
 Reduced interest cost will also increase its net profit in the coming years. As per the consensus estimate, HSIL’s net profit is expected to jump from Rs 34 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 130 crore in 2015-16, an annualised growth of 95 per cent.
 
 Though the counter was performing much better than the market, it started underperforming after the lacklustre second quarter numbers. A decisive turnaround from building products division in the third quarter can be the trigger for the counter. The current low valuation is another reason for this rerating— despite its high growth rates, it is still quoting only at 19 times its expected 2015-16 earnings per share.

HUL posts marginal rise in Q3 profit at Rs 649 crore,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/hul-posts-marginal-rise-in-q3-profit-at-rs-649-crore/articleshow/5506604.cms,m.economictimes.com,HUL posts marginal rise in Q3 profit at Rs 649 crore,"
  MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) mainstay soaps and detergents business continued to struggle during the three months to December 2009, but the homecare and personal products maker said signs of improvement are visible, as it reported a slight increase in sales and profit for the third quarter of the 2009-10 fiscal.
  
  
  Sale of soaps and detergents fell by 2.42% to Rs 2,072 crore, but HUL insisted that the glass was half full, pointing out in a statement that “actions to restore competitiveness in soaps and mass laundry yielded positive results, with the segment returning to volume growth during the quarter”. HUL makes Lifebuoy, Lux, Breeze and Liril soaps and Surf, Rin and Wheel laundry detergents. Net profit increased by 5% to Rs 649.1 crore, aided by exceptional gains from the sale of property during the quarter. Net sales grew 4.56% from a year ago to Rs 4,504.2 crore.
  
  
  HUL has been losing market share and shedding volumes in key segments such as soaps, tea and toothpaste in the past few quarters to aggressive smaller rivals. The company has responded with price cuts, relaunched brands and stepped up spending on advertising and promotions.
  
  
  “Volume growth accelerated in the quarter backed by quality innovations, increased brand support and continued focus on market execution,” chairman Harish Manwani said. Domestic consumer and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales grew by 5%, helped by growth in personal products, foods and water. Personal care product sales grew 16%, led by strong winter sales of skincare and haircare brands.
  
  
  Price cuts in soaps and laundry products such as Lux and Wheel helped restore volume growth during the quarter.
  
  
  Underlying operating profit grew 5% and operating margin excluding mark-to-market accounting impact on forex exposure improved 10 basis points to 16.8%. Excluding mark-to-market, profit after tax was flat.
  
  
  “Gross margins were at healthy levels and the cost of raw material was down 480 basis points. The underlying operating margin was up. Cost-saving programmes and buying efficiencies had also helped improve the margin,” CFO R Sridhar said. HUL may also introduce more brands from parent Unilever’s global portfolio in line with the market trends.
  
  
  The company is selling several residential and commercial properties across India to cut costs and raise cash. It has shifted its headquarters to Mumbai’s Andheri western suburb and will lease out its former headquarters in South Mumbai to either corporates or banks after refurbishing it, a company executive said.

 Through the open offer, Unilever, the company's overseas parent, has managed to increase its stake from 52.5% to over 67% now.
 
 The gains made by the MNC FMCG stock had a rub-off effect on other MNC stocks of the sector.
 
 Stocks of Colgate Palmolive appreciated 2.3% to Rs 1385.95, Procter & Gamble Health & Hygiene gained 1.6% to Rs 2982, Nestle India closed 0.5% higher at Rs 5146.2 and Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare rose 0.35% to Rs 5571.
 
 A similar thing occurred the day after the open offer of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare closed on January 30 this year.
 
 Speculations about other MNCs consumer goods companies also adopting a similar move to increase the shareholding of their overseas parent is attracting buying interest in stocks like Colgate Palmolive, Nestle India, P&G Health & Hygiene and Gillette India.
 
 These companies have a relatively lower promoter shareholding of 51%, 62.76%, 68.7% and 41% respectively. Besides, there is always an additional de-listing premium that gets built into MNCs stocks in anticipation of an open offer announcement from such companies.

The broking firm holds positive outlook for cement companies and expects meaningful upgrades over the next few quarters.
 
 ""Given our positive outlook, we have upgraded our earnings estimates by 4-11% for ACC, Ambuja and UltraTech, backed by 10-12% upward revision in realization assumptions,"" the MOSL report said.
 
 Top cement majors have reported strong numbers in the first quarter thanks to improvement in operations and margins. The robust performance is attributable to strong quarter-on-quarter improvement in realisations (about 6-8%) and in-line stable volumes.
 
 ""We believe that the worst is behind for the cement industry. We expect gradual and consistent improvement in capacity utilization and operating performance. Long-term demand drivers remain in place,"" the MOSL report said.
 
 After the recent outperformance, cement stocks are trading at historical average valuations, leaving limited room for further re-rating. MOSL analysts expect strong earnings growth to drive stock performance from current price levels. The brokerage has named Ambuja Cement, UltraTech and Shree Cement as its top sectoral picks.
 
 Cement prices improved by Rs 5 - 10 per bag month-on-month across regions in June 2012 after a temporary blip in May 2012. MOSL analysts saw no seasonal moderation in July 2012. """"Stable demand scenario and weak monsoon have supported cement prices even during the seasonally weak period,"""" the report said.
 
 Moderation is coal prices has also helped cement companies significantly. Energy cost moderated for select companies owing to reduction of imported coal prices though meaningfully diluted by depreciating rupee. We see limited cost pressures hereon, except for potential increase in diesel prices, the report said.
 
 Although current cement prices are at peak, they need to increase further to generate economic returns for new plants. Current cement prices are still Rs 40 per bag below the longer-term viable pricing. """"We believe higher capex cost of upcoming supplies will provide strong support to cement prices,"""" the MOSL report said.
 
 However, MOSL analysts feel any sort of government intervention could upset the apple cart of most cement companies. ""We believe any intervention by the government to curb cement prices is a key risk for the industry. In the past, the government has intervened in free pricing of cement to curb inflation. This had severely impacted operating performance of the cement companies and their stock prices,"" the report noted.

Ashwani Gujral: On the expiry day, even Chinese markets tried to weigh on the sentiment, but the 8280 level on Nifty did not break. The good news is that both CNX IT and Bank Nifty are showing a decent amount of strength. They are not showing any weakness.
 
 Hence, one can build chances of index hitting 8,450 soon. That said, anything can happen if the 50-pack index starts breaking 8,280 decisively. In the ongoing decline, all the three indices are now holding on to their 20-day moving averages.

"Interim Budget impact: Markets get a boost, ratings cut worry ebbs",positive,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/interim-budget-impact-markets-get-a-boost-ratings-cut-worry-ebbs/articleshow/30614655.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,"Interim Budget impact: Markets get a boost, ratings cut worry ebbs","NEW DELHI: The good thing about the interim Budget was that it did not throw up any negative surprises and made a point that India's economy is on a firm ground, say experts.

""At least the Budget did not make things worse,"" Arnab Das of Das Capital tells ET Now.

""Things are somewhat more stable and somewhat stronger across the emerging market universe, mainly because the US dollar is weaker; and in turn that owes to the string of weak US data which suggests that even if the Fed does not dial down the speed of the tapering, the forward guidance about rates remaining at zero for a long time is going to become more credible. So, that is imparting a little bit more stability to emerging markets as a whole.""

A day after Finance Minister P Chidambaram presented interim Budget, the 30-stock Sensex is trading with gains of over 150 points as of 12:09 pm, suggesting that the market may not be overly optimistic but is for sure on a soild ground given the state of the economy.

""Broad numbers clearly have a solid base now, thanks to the kind of conclusion of this particular round of earnings call that we saw. Also, with the inflation broadly under control and currency very stable. Even in vote on account, the finance minister's commitment was very-very strong that we got to have a very controlled fiscal discipline kind of a situation and controlled inflation"" says Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD & Co Founder, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

He says the probability of markets heading southward is limited, but the upside can be anything. ""My sense is that we have a very reasonable valuation and very promising election going ahead. I would be surprised if there's a downside from here; I mean that the upside could be anything, but downside is very-very limited,"" he says.

What was in the Budget that is making investors confident?

""It was an absolutely wonderful performance, because it is the first time we saw a government cutting 70-80 thousand crore of expenditure in election year. I do not think it has happened ever before. This shows the fiscal prudence that has now started to come into the political system and that is a great relief,"" says Ajay Srivastava, CEO Dimensions Consulting.

Given this, how strong is the possibility of the markets rallying ahead of general elections?

""You have the elections, and from a domestic perspective the focus would increasingly shift there ... a lot of investors we spoke to have called elections a binary event. So, opinions are divided on whether there would be a rally before the elections,"" says Tirthankar Patnaik, Director, Strategist-Institutional Research, Religare Capital Markets.


	 
A big positive from the Budget has been that the worry over a possible ratings cut seems to have ebbed.

""The current account deficit was a worry; but it has now corrected itself. So, the balance of risks is stable,"" says Atsi Sheth, VP-Sovereign Risk Group, Moody's.

Any negative from the Budget could have well tilted the scales unfavourably.

""What we have seen in the recent data is that inflation appears to be abating, at least in the near term; and that is one thing that the RBI will monitor. The other thing that the RBI had pointed to, not just recently but in the past as well, is that look fiscal deficit feeds inflation; so, fiscal consolidation is something that they are also monitoring. In terms of headline numbers, the deficit has been brought down, the borrowing requirement consequently is lower,"" says Atsi Sheth.

On a cautious note, he says, ""but again, risks remain. There is still volatility for the rupee ... food prices are very hard to predict and those could feed inflation. So, the balance of risk is still leaning towards a still-high inflation,"" he says.

Also, global rating agency Fitch had earlier warned that unchecked fiscal deficit and high inflation could lead to a negative rating action.

With both looking under check now, thanks to the figures presented in the Budget, the threat of a ratings downgrade looks abating; the only threat being an unfavourable election mandate.

Chidambaram's interim Budget has put the fiscal deficit for 2013-14 at 4.6% of the GDP, as against the target of 4.8%.

Also, it projected next year's target at 4.1%.

ET Now: There is currently huge volatility not only in the market, but separately within the banking segment also. What would you prefer now, private sector banks or PSU banks, keeping it in mind that PSU banks are going to give more returns once the economy recovers?
 
 
Kunj Bansal: The ideal approach would be to build a mix of the two. Now, what percentage of private sector bank stocks and how much of PSU ones — one has to decide on his own. One has to consider the fact that the public sector banks today are offering a valuation comfort despite a rise in the last two or two-and-a-half months. A lot of banks are trading close to price book of one and even lesser. That is where the percentage-return opportunity is higher compared to private sector banks. Within PSU banks, apart from Bank of Baroda, the other attractive name is Union Bank. So, these are the stocks one should look at. I would recommend that investors, especially short-term investors, build a higher percentage of exposure in PSU banks.
 
 
ET Now: The numbers for OBC do not look good. NPAs have gone up and net interest margins have contracted. Besides, the management commentary is weak too. I wonder why market men are buying into PSU banks. 

 
Kunj Bansal: Very true. It would not be prudent to believe that because of the recent movement in the public sector bank suddenly their quarterly results will also start looking good. In the momentum of the market we tend to forget the fundamentals. In terms of this quarter's numbers, not much change is expected, particularly as far as NPA are concerned. What the market typically does is place bets at least six months ahead. What is more, All expectations of market recovery are hinged on the hopes of a stable government. Talking of the hopes of an economic recovery, when recovery takes place some of the NPAs also recover. 

 So, hopefully a recovery will happen. If not, investors in the market will go wrong this time as well. It is not that this will be the first time, because investors go wrong all the time.

ET Now: Which is a stronger trader – buying into defensives like IT, etc, the way we spoke about it at closing or just staying away and maybe waiting for lower levels and buy into some of the cyclicals?
 
 Ashwani Gujral: IT can be bought because IT is looking positive as the rupee is looking negative, so that trade probably continues and the market is not falling all that much because 7580 was earlier support where it kind of found support for four days, now it has fallen, it has found a level of 7500 where it has found support for about four days now.
 
 So what is happening is that without falling, we are tending to correct and in this process the 20-day moving average is slowly moving towards the market which is now about 7489.
 
 We should be happy with that but clearly rupee is looking extremely weak and that means that IT should find support around these levels and maybe look at 9750-9800 on CNX IT in the days to come.
 
 While not participating and standing on the sidelines is a choice people can exercise but if there is an opportunity to make some money, it should be taken and it is definitely not being short on the market or an individual stocks because reversals in a bull market are fairly sharp and you will end up getting trapped in stocks like HP, BP like people figured out on Friday.
