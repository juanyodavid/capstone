Mid caps now turn into market darlings,positive,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tide-turns-as-midcaps-become-brokerages-darling-again/articleshow/68350992.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Tide turns as midcaps become brokerages' darling, again","Mid- and small-cap shares are back on brokerages’ radar after remaining out of favour for over a year. A key reason behind it is that the current government's chances to come back to power after elections have improved following India’s military standoff with Pakistan. That is why the broader market has seen buying. As a result, midcaps have rebounded strongly. 

The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices have gained 4.4 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in the past two weeks, compared to the Sensex which is up 2.2 per cent during the same period. In 2018, BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices had fallen 13.4 per cent and 23.7 per cent, respectively. Also, there were macro headwinds and concerns about corporate governance and liquidity issues and there was lack of pick-up in earnings growth. Analysts believe the tide seems to be turning in favour of the broader market again. 

“Typically, the spread between large-cap and mid-cap returns has peaked out at 15-20 per cent. Post hitting this peak range, the performance has reversed in the past. Currently, this spread stands at 18 per cent,” said Motilal Oswal in a note. ET takes a look at midcap picks of top brokerages and their outlook going forward.


CLSA



SADBHAV ENGINEERING
CMP: Rs 223.35
Change in last one year : -41.8 per cent

Despite the recent 44 per cent rally since its low, Sadbhav Engineering’s stock trades at 7 times FY20 adjusted earnings and its valuation appears attractive, said foreign brokerage CLSA. The brokerage has added the midcap stock to its portfolio.


SOBHA
CMP: Rs 438.7
Change in last one year : -20 per cent

Sobha is another midcap in CLSA’s model portfolio. The foreign brokerage said the launch of Sobha’s second affordable project should help drive sales in the near term. “Sobha’s timely new launches amidst tough liquidity conditions for developers should help it gain market share significantly. ” said CLSA in a recent report, while retaining buy rating with a target price of Rs 628.


GODREJ PROPERTIES
CMP: Rs 699.55
Change in last one year : -6.7 per cent

Godrej Properties delivered good operating performance in the third quarter and this performance comes amidst tight liquidity for the sector, demonstrating Godrej’s strength and ability to gain from the ongoing sector consolidation, said CLSA. Access to cheap liquidity, a good delivery trackrecord and its timely expansion make Godrej well poised to gain market share, said CLSA.


MOTILAL OSWAL


INDRAPRASTHA GAS
CMP: Rs 293.35
Change in last one year : -5.5 per cent

Indraprastha Gas is one of Motilal Oswal’s preferred midcap ideas. The brokerage said in a recent report that Indraprastha Gas’ consistent operational outperformance, the government’s thrust on gas usage, and sustainable high-growth market warrant premium valuations. The recent Supreme Court ruling for Indraprastha to take over the assets of Haryana City Gas Distribution is another positive from the short- to medium-term volume growth perspective, said Motilal Oswal.


FEDERAL BANK
CMP: Rs 87.65
Change in last one year : -5.8 per cent

Federal Bank has maintained strong business momentum and it is reporting a gradual improvement in operating earnings. Strong capitalization levels and a robust liability franchise will enable market share gains in both corporate and retail segments, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 115.


SUN TV NETWORK
CMP: Rs 596.35
Change in last one year : -33.4 per cent

Motilal Oswal expects 12 per cent compounded growth in advertisement revenue over FY19 -FY21 on the back of new launches and increasing share of commission model-based shows. This, coupled with a foray in the Bangla genre, augurs well for the company, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report on Sun TV. Burgeoning IPL revenue is also expected to provide a fillip to overall revenue, it added.


CITIGROUP
SRF
CMP: Rs 2,351.85
Change in last one year : 27.3 per cent

SRF is among Citi’s top midcap ideas. SRF’s unique fluorine chemistry skills, history of innovation and operational management track-record, along with its proven ability to extract profits from even commoditized businesses, provide a long growth runway, said Citi.


SHRIRAM TRANSPORT FINANCE CO.
CMP: Rs 1,220.30
Change in last one year : -8.1 per cent

Shriram Transport’s niche focus on used vehicle segment and diversified borrowing profile positions it better to navigate through the liquidity challenges and tide over the cyclical nature of vehicle industry, said Citi. Whole the gross nonperforming asset ratio remains elevated at around 9 per cent, higher provision coverage ratio alleviates any major asset quality concern, it added. The stock trades at 1.7 times adjusted price-to-book on March 2020 estimates versus long term average of 2.1 times, said Citi.


EMAMI
CMP: Rs 383.1
Change in last one year : -29.3 per cent

Emami has underperformed the sector given its weak performance in multiple quarters. However, revenue trends are improving and three of its four segments are recovering as well, said Citigroup Global Markets. Valuations at 29 times FY20 adjusted EPS is well below sector peers and group leverage has reduced after promoters divested 10 per cent stake in the company, added Citi.

Infosys: Will the strong volume growth sustain?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-will-the-strong-volume-growth-sustain/articleshow/21033072.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys: Will the strong volume growth sustain?,"MUMBAI: A stronger business volume growth and sustained momentum in new client accounts are brighter spots in the performance of Infosys in the first quarter of FY14. However, the management's stance to keep dollar denominated revenue guidance unchanged at 6-10% growth for the fiscal reflects that caution is still the buzzword. 

 Infosys, the second largest among the IT exporters that are listed on Indian bourses, reported 7.8% sequential growth in revenue at Rs 11,267 crore for the June 2013 quarter, surpassing the analysts' average estimate of 5.5% growth. The ET Intelligence Group (ETIG) had predicted 6.7% sequential increase in revenue. 

 Operating profit or earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) however lagged the ETIG's estimation of Rs 2,778.4 crore. The company reported Rs 2,664 crore in EBIT, a sequential growth of 8.2%. 

 The company was able to retain the operating margin calculated as the proportion of EBIT in the revenue at 23.6% compared with the previous quarter. For the September 2013 quarter, however, its CFO Rajiv Bansal has cited a negative impact of around 300 basis points on profitability due to the salary hikes of average 8% initiated at the beginning of July. 

 The stock market has reacted positively to the results. At Rs 2,810, the stock has gained over 11% in the morning session on Friday. The big jump can be attributed to a sharp increase in the rupee denominated revenue guidance by the company to 13-17% for the fiscal from the earlier forecast of 6-10% growth. 

 The company has been finding it difficult to report meaningful growth since the past few years. Against the backdrop, what could offer some relief to investors is the fact that it reported a strong 4.1% volume growth for the quarter, which is the largest since the September 2011 quarter when it had reported 4.5% jump. In addition, it continued to show momentum in new clients. It added 66 clients during the June 2013 quarter. 

 But, any major increase in the stock valuation from the current levels looks limited. This is because the company still faces pressure on its growth and margin, which is reflected from its stance of not revising the dollar denominated revenue guidance of 6-10% growth for the fiscal. 

 Also, it will be challenging to retain the strong volume growth amidst clouded outlook for IT demand. The management has iterated about the slowing offtake in the high-end, high-margin, discretionary projects. A rerating of the stock would require the company to show a sustained growth scenario in the coming quarters.

To raise the balance amount of Rs 286 crore, the company launched the third tranche of tax-free bonds on February 28. “We have raised Rs 279 crore from the third tranche.

The official said that the company has raised a total of Rs 4,993 crore through bonds out of Rs 5,000 crore allowed. The basic size of the issue was Rs 75 crore, with an option to retain over-subscription up to Rs 285.8 crore. In August, Hudco has raised Rs 190.8 crore.

 Nasdaq listed EXL however reduced its yearly sales guidance due to rupee depreciation. EXL Service now expects revenues of $438 million to $442 million in 2012, $3 million less than its earlier outlook.
 
 “About 25% of our revenues are either denominated in Indian Rupees or have a pricing linked to devaluation of the Indian currency, which has led to the reduction in revenue outlook,” said Rohit Kapoor, EXL Service CEO and Vice Chairman.
 
 Profits for the firm in Q2 beat estimates. EXL’s net profit grew to $9.1 million in Q2 compared to $8.5 million in the same period last year. Nasdaq listed EXL Service shares were up 2.3% in opening trade to $25 a piece due to the buoyant results.
 
 The company attributed growth to the strong demand for decision analytics services, particularly in the insurance and banking verticals.
 
 The company counts American Express and British Gas as its large customers. The BPO won nine new clients during the quarter.Kapoor said that he sees better business coming in next few quarters as the currency devaluation makes it cheaper for clients to outsource.
 
 During the quarter, EXL’s margins expanded year-over-year and sequentially, driven by foreign exchange as well as growth in its transformation business. The margin expansion more than offset the headwinds from wage increases implemented during the quarter.
 
 EXL’s operating profit margins grew to 13.3% compared to 11.1% for the same quarter in 2011.

ET Now: On Bharti you have seen this risk on risk off trade in Bharti. Bulls are of the view that pricing power is coming back for telecom companies so Bharti is a buy but the bears are insisting that there is no pricing power, balance sheet has got diluted and Africa is still is in a mess?
 
 
Vinay Khattar: Precisely for the same reason, my personal view is not very strong on either side. We were pretty early movers in terms of pricing power getting diluted quite a few years ago and we believe that the stocks would be in pain. Over the last one or two years you have seen certain degree of consolidation happening and beginning to happen and you are seeing certain elements of pricing power especially on the domestic side coming back. But is it early days on that my personal sense is yes you were want to wait a while and see how the trend actually plays out in terms of pricing power and we must not forget that the electronic space, the entire segment of more computerisation, more electronic space is pretty commoditise at this particular point in time and with new players like Reliance Geo entering the space you do not know how the even the data part is going to play out going forward. As far as Africa is concerned that remains a very big question mark. Lot of us who have been bullish on the Africa story at an earlier point in time have really not got it right and that remains a question mark. So my suggestion would be to wait and watch rather than bet very aggressively on a stock like this.

 The capital raising comes on the back of a strong operating margin performance in Q4 - reflecting cost reduction and margin improvement measures, as well as the expectation of a turnaround in the domestic commercial vehicle market, Ashok Leyland said in a statement. 

 The QIP, launched on June 26, attracted a very favourable response from institutional investors across geographies, it added. 

 ""The issue was subscribed by foreign institutional investors, mutual funds and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) amongst others. The issuance will help improve the debt and the financial position of Ashok Leyland,"" Ashok Leyland Chief Financial Officer Gopal Mahadevan said. 

 The Chennai-based firm allotted 1,852 lakh shares to eligible qualified institutional buyers at an issue price of Rs 36 per share (face value of Re 1 and a premium of Rs 35 per equity share), a premium of 5 per cent to the SEBI floor price, aggregating around Rs 667 crore. 

 Ashok Leyland shares were trading at Rs 33.05 apiece on the BSE, down 6.11 per cent from its previous close.

"At Wipro, growth remains a mirage",negative,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/at-wipro-growth-remains-a-mirage/articleshow/19629040.cms,m.economictimes.com,"At Wipro, growth remains a mirage","BANGALORE: Wipro, the last among India’s large information technology services companies to report March quarter earnings, posted the weakest sales-growth among peers, and gave a poor near-term outlook that could see its sales shrinking marginally in the June quarter.

The company’s management blamed the stagnating sales on discretionary spend not returning and lower exposure in the banking and financial services industry compared with peers.

“In the first month of the quarter, we expected discretionary spend to start coming in, but that did not happen till the end,” said TK Kurien chief executive officer. “That resulted in a large part of our miss in the banking and financial services vertical.”

Kurien added that unfavourable cross-currency movements also hurt sales numbers during the quarter. Wipro’s performance dashed investor hopes of a return to growth for the company, which has been lagging the industry for over a year now. In the just-completed financial year, the company saw sales expanding 5% as against industry growth pace of a little over 10%.

In the March quarter, sales reported in dollars grew 0.5% sequentially, compared with 1.4% for Infosys and a little over 3% for HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services. This was the second worst quarter for the company in the just-concluded financial year, the other being first quarter when revenues fell 1.4%.

Ever since chief executive officer TK Kurien took over in early 2011 after the co-CEO model was dismantled, it has been a story of waiting for investors. The latest financial performance not only fails to give proof of growth taking firm roots, but also signals that it may take much longer for the company to start matching its peers.

“The management has made several changes to the structure to align it more with the demand generation process and increasing efficiency,” said Dipen Shah of Kotak Securities. “We believe that, these initiatives have not yet started showing the expected results and will start reflecting in the financials in due course of time.”

	 


Kurien’s previous commentary over the quarters about putting together a crack team of “hunters” to get multi-hundred million-dollar technology contracts remains a work-in-progress as sales numbers do not seem to show proof of the efforts bearing fruit yet. Client additions, however, continued at reasonable pace with 52 new clients being added in the latest quarter.

While it may not negate the emerging consensus on demand revival in the industry, Wipro’s outlook, taken together with that of Infosys, does question the pace of recovery.

Combined with IBM missing estimates yesterday, Wipro’s dismal outlook does put a question mark on overall technology spending and the nature of technology spending in the current financial year.

The robust numbers coming from HCL Technologies and TCS, and the poor performance from Infosys and Wipro also raises the question about capabilities that different companies have to capture the nature of emerging demand, where newer technology areas such as cloud, mobility and analytics are gaining prominence.

The silver lining in the company’s performance during the March quarter was the jump in consulting revenues, which may signal early-stage projects, where revenue could start kicking in within one to two quarters. But the fall in revenue from Europe is worrisome, especially after the company won one large deal there recently.

	By: P S Reddy

The budget lays out the government borrowing programme in a financial year. But hardly anyone knows the process of borrowing and where the money comes from. World over it is an institutional market with players like banks, pension funds, insurance companies and MFs who participate both in primary and secondary markets. The RBI Working Group Report on enhancing liquidity in government securities devoted a chapter on ‘Retail Participation in G-sec Market’ but has not suggested solutions beyond the existing G-Sec functional framework.


	To begin with, poor retail participation is due to poor awareness. The existing infrastructure for G-Secs including participants such as bank treasury departments and primary dealers, are concentrated in Mumbai. Second, liquidity in the secondary market in G-Sec is conspicuous by its absence. The trading platforms of BSE and NSE for G-Secs have reported nil volume mostly due to poor retail holding. Third hurdle is the complex procedures to transfer securities from a SGL account to demat and vice-versa. Even between depositories interoperability for G-Secs is not permitted.


	The first step in this direction is to issue tax-free bonds which are hitherto issued by PSUs such as REC, PFC and NTPC as government bonds through the branch network of banks, and pass on the proceeds to PSUs. It will increase the liability of GoI. The liability does not stick to the government as the principle and the interest will be serviced by respective PSUs.


	As the banks get commission for distributing these bonds, they will be glad to sell to their customers. In the year 2012-13, Rs 18,000 crore bonds were issued, of which Rs 14,700 crore is through the public issue. In 2013-14, permission to issue tax-free bonds worth Rs 53,000 crore was received of which only Rs  32,000 crore was raised till December, 2013. 
	
	 

	 


	Every year in the Finance Act, the government can make a provision for issuing tax-free bonds on behalf of PSUs. But the government/RBI must issue bonds when the PSU wants them without getting stuck in bureaucracy. The cost of the issue will be borne by the PSU. The difference is that it will be called Government of India Bond and it will be sold through the branch network.


	This process will popularises  G-Secs amongst the public at no additional cost to the government. Although there are ninety-plus G-Secs outstanding, the most active ones are the top five securities with a tenure of ten years which accounts for 80-90per cent of the total G-Sec turnover. About 55per cent of the outstanding G-Secs are held by banks as a part of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) for mandatory compliance irrespective of the return on the securities.


	While RBI concurs that the SLR is required to be reduced over a period for optimum utilisation of resources it is better if a return-reward scheme is devised for availing lower SLR by the banks. RBI may permit banks to sell a part of their SLR securities holding (say 5per cent) to retail investors through their branch network with an offer to buy back from the customers any time during the bond tenure.


	Banks have to display in their branches bid and ask prices on a daily basis much the same way the FD rates are displayed. With this policy framework in place, commercial banks which desire to earn higher returns than what the G-Secs are offering will undertake marketing of G-Secs to its customers.

	 The scheduled commercial banks together hold `20 lakh crore G-Sec as at the end of March, 2013. If RBI permits even a 5per cent of the outstanding amount for offloading to retail investors, it will be `1 lakh crore. To monitor the distribution of G-Secs banks have to open a demat pool account of G-Secs and transfer G-Secs to the demat accounts of customers as and when the transaction takes place. The depositories can furnish MIS to RBI about the SLR securities divested to retail investors.


	The depository for G-Secs is run by RBI which maintains records at ‘nominee’ level as against ‘beneficial owner’ level maintained in CDSL/NSDL. As a result, the RBI will have only the aggregate number of securities of each participant such as a bank or a primary dealer who in turn will have the record of the individual beneficiary owner.


	The depositories have respective CSGL accounts with RBI and the transfer between one beneficial owner in one depository to another beneficial owner in another depository cannot happen without change in CSGL accounts maintained with RBI. As many investors in the secondary market experienced superior infrastructure with a transparent accounting process, they are not able to accept the transfer mechanism in existence for G-Secs. RBI may discard the SGL/CSGL system and ask the banks to hold and transact in G-Secs through CDSL/NSDL. With these three measures which are all doable, the RBI must give it a try.

Strong deals crucial for Wipro's growth push,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/wipro-sales-engine-is-getting-stronger-every-quarter-thierry-delaporte/articleshow/93019340.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Wipro sales engine is getting stronger every quarter: Thierry Delaporte,HOLAXD
Ten key takeaways from Wipro Q1 results,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/ten-key-takeaways-from-wipro-q1-results/articleshow/48195746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ten key takeaways from Wipro Q1 results,"BENGALURU: Here are 10 takeaways from the first quarter results of Wipro: 

 
Revenue: Wipro barely managed to meet its own revenue guidance, posting a 1.1% sequential increase in revenues. CEO TK Kurien conceded that the performance was disappointing and said that the results were “not great,” blaming the underperformance on a tough quarter from its energy vertical that took out $200 million from its top-line this quarter. The weak Q1 numbers will now make it nearly impossible for Wipro to post double-digit year-on-year revenue growth this year. 

 
Guidance: Wipro’s guidance of 1.5-3.5% sequential growth in revenue for Q2 indicates a much improved performance ahead, but it still won’t be good enough to make up for the deficit from Q1. The road to consistently strong revenue growth for Wipro looks like a tough one for now and will put even more pressure on Kurien, given that Wipro recently created a COO position to free him up from daily operations and focus only on future strategy and vision. 

 
Hikes for top performers: Wipro HR head Saurabh Govil said that top performers across the company have been rewarded with a 10-15% average hike, with one out of every four Wipro employee receiving a double-digit hike. The wage hikes dragged down the margins for this quarter, and Wipro said the impact of wage hikes will be felt in the next quarter too. Wipro also handed out promotions to about 10,000 junior-level employees. 

 
Hiring and utilisation: Wipro ended the quarter with a total headcount of 161,789, with a gross headcount addition of 3572. Around 12,517 sales and support staff left the company during the quarter -- higher than last quarter’s figure of 11,629. Utilisation inched up by 140 basis points to 81.9% from the last quarter. 

 
Client additions:  Wipro added 36 new customers during the quarter, but the number of $100-million customers dropped by one. The company added two clients in its $75-million customer bucket. Overall, the company was hit hard because of the energy vertical, where most of its top customers cut back on spending due to falling oil prices. Wipro, however, said that things had stabilised in the energy vertical and it was well-poised for growth in the near term. 

 
Verticals: As mentioned earlier, energy proved to be a drag during -- other than E&U, even healthcare faced a tough quarter, while telecom continued to decline as well. 

 
Margins: Margins dropped 120 basis points from last quarter to 21%, hurt mainly by the wage hikes and pricing pressure in the traditional outsourcing business. 

 
Investments in startups: Wipro Ventures made two startup investments during the quarter -- artificial intelligence startup Vicarious and early-stage big data startup Talena. San Francisco-based Vicarious is developing the next-generation of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and solutions that aims to digitally replicate the part of the human brain which controls vision, body and language to enable computers achieve human-level intelligence. What's particularly noteworthy though is that the startup is backed by a long list of notable investors that includes Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Vinod Khosla, Ashton Kutcher, Dustin Moskovitz, Aaron Levie, Sam Altman, Formation 8 and Swiss automation giant ABB. It has raised around $70 million funding until now. 

 
Geographies: Europe proved to be the biggest drag during the quarter, registering a decline in revenues by 11% on a year-on-year basis and by 1.9% on a sequential basis. India and Middle East saw a significant pickup with a 20% y-o-y growth, while the Americas clocked an 8.6% growth in sales. 

 
Holmes and Wipro Digital: CEO TK Kurien said Wipro was making considerable progress on both its artificial-intelligence platform Holmes and its digital business. The investment in Vicarious was part of a broader strategy to boost and add to Holmes’s existing capabilities, Kurien told ET. Wipro Digital, which bought a design firm called Designit earlier in July, won important deals from Allied Irish Bank and the Lawn Tennis Association of the UK.

  Devang Visaria, Chief Strategist, devangvisaria.com, in a chat with ET Now talks about Whirpool.
   
  
  What is your view on Whirlpool?
   
  Whirlpool was on a very smart parabolic rise 3-4 months back and since then it has been just consolidating in a rising kind of small trading channel. Going ahead, I would expect a breakout on the upside. This breakout level is placed at 335 and it is a similar chart to VIP Industries before it moved from 400 to 600. So if you are an aggressive trader, this is the stock for you possibly with a deeper stop loss closer to 290. 
  
  We would look for a first target of 400 and would not be surprised if that was also to be taken out and possibly the stock heads to around 450-475 with a two or three month kind of horizon.

VRL Logistics IPO grey market premium at 38%,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/vrl-logistics-ipo-grey-market-premium-at-38/articleshow/46931207.cms,m.economictimes.com,VRL Logistics IPO grey market premium at 38%,"MUMBAI: The demand for the initial public offering of VRL Logistics is slowing picking up. In the grey market, the issue is valued at 38 per cent premium or Rs 78 to the high end of price band, say ET Now sources. 

 Till 2 p.m.; the issue was subscribed 0.27 times as per the NSE website. The valuations are attractive as compared to listed peers and the issue is likely to sail through comfortably, say marketmen. 

 The issue ends on April 17, 2015. 

 VRL specialises in surface logistics and parcel delivery service. It owns and operates the largest fleet of commercial vehicles and has transportation network in 28 States. 

 The company has issued shares to anchor investors such as ICICI Prudential, DSP Blackrock, Birla Sunlife, L&T MF, Sundaram MF, ADIA and East Spring at higher end of the price band at Rs 205/share. 

 The proceeds from the IPO will be utilised to purchase of goods transportation vehicles and repayment of certain borrowings. 

 Brokerages have ??advised investors to ‘Subscribe’ to VRL Logistics IPO. 

 According to IIFL report, at the upper end of Rs195-205 price range, the stock is valued at 14.7x FY16E EPS of Rs 13.9 whereas peers such as Gati and Transport Corporation of India trade in the range of 18x-25x. 

 “We note that apart from plain vanilla surface logistics, these peers also provide niche services like express delivery, ecommerce delivery and supply chain management and therefore trade at higher multiples,” the report said. 

 “Nevertheless, with the improving macroeconomic environment, contribution of freight transportation via road is poised to increase and VRL with its largest fleet size, superior track record, strong brand name, diverse client base, and vast management experience is all set to benefit from the opportunities provide by the sector,” it added.

"IPO after tax row is settled, says Vodafone",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/telecom/vodafone-may-not-review-india-ipo-before-ending-tax-row/articleshow/35974768.cms,m.economictimes.com,Vodafone may not review India IPO before ending tax row,"
	MUMBAI: Vodafone Group is unlikely to take a call on whether or not to proceed with its Indian unit’s initial public offering — a plan that was put on the backburner two years ago — until its tax dispute here is resolved and the impact of the next round of spectrum auction on its local finances becomes clear.


	The UK-based telecom major though is hopeful that the new BJPled government would work towards resolving the dispute over the tax, which has now grown to about Rs 20,000 crore, including penalty and interest.


	Local tax authorities had slapped a principal liability of Rs 8,000 crore on Vodafone over its $11-billion deal in 2007 to buy Hutchison Telecommunications International’s majority stake in Hutchison Essar (now Vodafone India). According to officials, the company should have deducted the tax from its payment to Hutchison and paid to the government. Vodafone challenged the claim saying that no tax was payable since it was a deal between two companies based abroad, a view backed by the Supreme Court in January 2012. The government later that year changed laws to tax such transactions retroactively.


	Informal talks to resolve the dispute fell through earlier this year, and Vodafone has invoked international arbitration to resolve the issue.


	In a recent interview, Vodafone India chief executive Marten Pieters told ET that comments from the new Narendra Modi government have raised hope of a more favourable view on the tax case. ""Modi himself and his BJP colleagues have taken a very clear public stance on how bad retrospective tax is. So, they will have a different look at tax, but does that mean the Vodafone tax case will go away?""


	According to him, ""the big boss (Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao) has said that he wants the tax case to be resolved before we can process the IPO, and from his perspective I can imagine he wants a good feeling on the case.""


	The company shelved the India IPO plan in 2012 after the government decided to retroactively change the tax law, which effectively nullified the Supreme Court ruling. Vodafone’s external affairs director Mathew Kirk last week met finance secretary Arvind Mayaram and revenue secretary Rajiv Takru.


	After the meeting, a finance ministry official said the company was keen on conciliation and settling the tax dispute outside the judicial process. The government has to appoint an arbitrator before June 15 following Vodafone’s arbitration notice. The stability of Vodafone India’s balance sheet ahead of the IPO is another key issue that the company would need to consider before deciding on an initial public offering.


	This February, Vodafone India bidRs 19,600 crore to successfully retain airwaves in the 900 MHz band in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata where its licences were up for renewal, and buy 1800 MHz spectrum in 11 other service areas.


	Pieters said Vodafone will fight fiercely to retain 900 MHz in areas where licences will come up for renewal in the next two years. To continue providing services in these places, it will have to buy airwaves through a government auction. The company is also likely to bid for 900 MHz in some circles where it doesn’t have that band of airwaves, Pieters added.


	""We would love to have 900 MHz everywhere, but reality is there are more takers. We will fight for where we have it because it is painful to change the network,"" he said. According to a Deutsche Bank report, based on the outcome of the latest auction in February, Vodafone will likely require as much asRs 31,400 crore to buy 900 MHz spectrum in the six circles where its licences are set to expire at the end of next year. The big fund outgo could weigh on its IPO process.


	 

	An analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage said while Vodafone India’s IPO has been talked about for over three years, and some bankers have worked on it in the past, the bookbuilding process will have to be initiated from the start.


	The process alone would take three months to a year. ""Vodafone already has reputed external auditors and well-documented financials that get reported on the UK entity, so the time line could be lesser for them than some others,"" this executive said.


	Two years ago, Vodafone started reporting its India numbers in the build up to required public disclosures for the IPO. However, worsening of the tax case and the Indian telecom sector in general has resulted in the company shelving the share-sale plan. The person who was to handle the role of company secretary has been redeployed in another finance roll with no clarity on whether he will be needed in the investor-relations role, said a person in the know.

 The company had received the permission from market regulator Sebi in March 2013 for its proposed Rs 700-crore IPO but did not launch the same due to bad market conditions. 

 ""We are engaged with our advisors and investment bankers. We have appointed Axis Capital among others to advise us on the same. We are planning the IPO this financial year itself,"" Videocon director Saurabh Dhoot told PTI here today. 

 The satellite TV arm of the diversified Videocon group today formally announced the change of its name from Bharat Business Channel to Videocon d2h. 

 Dhoot said the rechristening will not have any impact on the IPO. 

 The company also unveiled its 4K ultra high definition services which it will roll out over next three quarters, he said. 

 The company expects an uptick in the sales of 4K or UHD panels in the festive season and it would be targeting its existing customer base. 

 ""It would begin with important sports events which would be enabled by the 4K feed. So we are well prepared to launch that service for our customers. Then we would have movies and general entertainment,"" he said. 

 The company caters to 11 million customers and has been growing at 40 per cent CAGR, Dhoot said.

"Amidst commodity boom, vanilla remains plain vanilla",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/amidst-commodity-boom-vanilla-remains-plain-vanilla/articleshow/6092370.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Amidst commodity boom, vanilla remains plain vanilla","
  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In Kerala's commodity-rich high ranges, swanky automobiles compete for attention with palatial homes, thanks to a sustained commodity price boom. It isn't easy to spot a gloomy face, but look a little deeper and there are the vanilla farmers, who seem to be the odd ones out when the whole region is ecstatic.
  
  Their heartbreak is entirely owed to the collapse of the commodity's price. Raw vanilla prices - that had once ruled at unbelievable levels of Rs 3,000-3,500 per kg, making a few growers millionaires overnight and prompting hundreds of others to take to growing the climber - are now ruling at an equally incredulous rate of Rs 40 per kg.
  
  Some blame it on misleading production figures emanating from Madagascar, the leading producer of the spice, while others say that it is the competition from synthetic vanilla that is keeping natural vanilla prices at such rock bottom levels.
  
  Says John P John, CEO of Kottayam-based Tharakan & Co: ""Many commercial users of vanilla, like ice cream makers, use synthetic vanilla, and several of those users who have once enjoyed the price difference, refuse to return to using natural vanilla. The result has been a sustained slide in vanilla prices, despite a fall in production"".
  
  He says production in the just-concluded season for the whole country was estimated at 60 tonnes, as against about 150 tonnes in the previous year. Despite the steep year-on-year fall in production of raw vanilla beans, the price this year was lackluster, fluctuating from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 40 per kg.
  
  The mood is equally subdued in the villages of Karnataka where vanilla plantations once thrived. According to Ravi Bhat, a vanilla farmer in Uttar Kannada district, the export-oriented nature of the commodity, its demand dependency on the US market, and the infections affecting the vanilla plants have all contributed to the decline in vanilla's fortunes.
  
  ""As against some 4,000-5,000 farmers who grew vanilla some six years ago in the Sirsi region, there are only some 500 sticking to the crop. The present prices are unsustainable for the farmers"", says Bhat. Farmers say they are not just competing with leading producers like Madagascar, Indonesia, Mexico, Uganda and Papua New Guinea, but struggling with different plant infections as well.
  
  The mood is summed up by John P John, who says growers may even stop cultivating the crop. ""The way it is going, vanilla cultivation may disappear in India within a few years"", says John. That is, if infections affecting the plant and the inability of farmers to even maintain their farms with the existing price realizations, do not put a natural end to the crop before that.

4200 is key level for Titan: Ashwani Gujral,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/4200-is-key-level-for-titan-ashwani-gujral/articleshow/8267251.cms,m.economictimes.com,4200 is key level for Titan: Ashwani Gujral,"
  Ashwani Gujral, Chief Market Strategist, ashwanigujral.com, in an interview with ET Now talks about Titan
  
  
  What is the call on Titan?
  
  Titan is finding great difficulty in crossing levels of Rs 4200 and chances are that if it does not cross these levels in a hurry, then it could have a fairly sharp decline but for that, it will need to break down below Rs 3850. So, 4200 is a key level. Below that it remains a bit weak.

From Vikram Pandit of Citibank and Arun Sarin of Vodafone to Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen, Indians have time and again proved that they are head-and-shoulders above others.Mr Kapoor began his career 23 years ago with Nestle and moved on to Bausch & Lomb, where he was part of the start-up team that launched Ray Ban sunglasses and the Bausch & Lomb vision care range in India.He went on to manage the overseas marketing territories of Russia, Ukraine and East Africa in addition to the Saarc region and then lived in Thailand for five years, running the company’s South-East Asia operations.

  Ramanathan K, CIO, ING Investment Management India, talks to ET Now on telecom stocks.
  
   
  
  Do you think these problems are confined to Bharti alone of late by virtue of the foreign currency debt that they have or you are bearish on the telecom space in general as well?
   
  I would not like to comment on a specific stock, I am not allowed to do it but on the sector, we are neutral. Yes, you have regulatory compulsions in terms of the fresh guidelines, which are yet to be formally announced while there have been some information, which has been published in the media. 
  
  Out of the two incremental information, which has come the 8% license fee I do not think so is a major issue but what is an issue is the charging for the extra spectrum, which could impact especially smaller telecom stocks not necessarily Bharti Airtel, so we would use this as an opportunity to increase or overweight the telecom sector rather than sell at current levels because we have seen such volatility during the 3G auction also. 
  
  There were a lot of comments on the auction bids being irrational and so on and so forth and the telecom sector got beaten down quite a lot after that but since then it has been one of the best performing sectors, so we believe that these are opportunities to overweight this sector from a portfolio perspective rather than selling at current levels or going underweight.

Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuations,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/several-small-caps-trading-at-eye-popping-valuations/articleshow/45092472.cms,m.economictimes.com,Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuations,"MUMBAI: Late last week, when little-known Tilak Finance made it to the MSCI Small Cap index, it stunned many on Dalal Street. The company’s turnover for the year ended March 31, 2014 was Rs 6.42 crore, while its market capitalisation — value of outstanding shares — was Rs 3,861 crore on Friday. The company’s only asset is the 19.2 lakh shares, worth Rs 86 lakh, it owns in Esaar India (not Essar Group).
 
 The inclusion of Tilak Finance along with a couple of others into the MSCI index has put the spotlight on small-cap stocks — many of which are trading at eye-popping valuations. Market watchers said the abnormal values of these stocks suggest operators are active in many of them.
 
 According to an ET study, the market capitalisation-to-sales ratio of nearly 250 actively-traded small-cap stocks is between 50 and 500 times. M-cap-to-sales ratio — one of the several popular valuation matrices — evaluates a stock’s performance vis-à-vis the company’s actual performance. Broadly, a stock with a marketcap-to-sales ratio of less than one can be considered undervalued. But this ratio varies from sector to sector. For instance, the market cap-to-sales of the IT index is 4.2 times; 5 times for fast-moving consumer goods, 1.6 times for capital goods and 0.6 times for oil and gas.
 
 
  “Almost in all these stocks promoter holding is minimal, which makes it easy for the operators to manipulate their stock prices,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder and CEO of KRIS Research.
 
 After a long hiatus, activity in mid- and small-cap stocks revived in February, sparked by the election euphoria. The heightened activity in this category of shares in the last few months is the lengthiest since 2007. For instance, MC Fincorp (formerly Priti Mercantile) has surged over 331% since January 1. The company with a turnover of Rs 10 crore and net profit of Rs 1.28 crore as on March 31, 2014 is currently valued about Rs 5,000 crore in market cap, which is more than the value of more established companies such as Pfizer, IL&FS Transport, JK Lakshmi Cement or Sobha Developers. CCL International, with a net profit of just Rs 99 lakh, is trading at a market cap of Rs 4,906 crore. The stock found place in the recent revamp of MSCI Smallcap Index.
 
 Several companies like Goldline International, Sulabh Engineers & Services, Pine Animation, Surabhi Chemicals & Investments and Mangalam Industrial Finance, among others, with a sales of few crores and profits of a few lakhs traded with a market cap of over Rs 2,000 crore. Officials at larger brokerages said operators are luring retail investors to buy these stocks by sending text message alerts, Whatsapp messages and emails though it is not as rampant as it was in 2006 and 2007.
 
 While capital market regulator Sebi has strengthened its surveillance in recent years, market watchers believe more could be done in the small-cap space. “The stocks that are trading at unreasonable valuations without any reason warrant an investigation for the price manipulations,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD, InGovern Research Services.

Prasun Kumar Mukherjee quits Sesa Sterlite,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/prasun-kumar-mukherjee-quits-sesa-sterlite/articleshow/32854326.cms,m.economictimes.com,Prasun Kumar Mukherjee quits Sesa Sterlite,"NEW DELHI: Sesa Sterlite's Executive Director (Iron Ore Business) Prasun Kumar Mukherjee has quit the company, making the first high profile exit from the Vedanta group since its restructuring in August last year. 

 Confirming the news, company officials said Sesa Sterlite Board is scheduled to meet tomorrow for accepting the resignation of Mukherjee, who was the go-to man of Vedanta chief Anil Agarwal in the times of distress. 

 The officials, requesting not to be identified, further said that Mukherjee, who is also a member of the Sesa Sterlite Board, will be demitting office on March 31. 

 Incidently, M S Mehta, CEO of Vedanta Resources Plc and Sesa Sterlite, both, will also be retiring on March 31, making two top level exits from Vedanta group on the same day. 

 Vedanta has already announced appointment of former Rio Tinto boss Tom Albanese as CEO of both the firms from April 1. 

 The sources said that till a successor of Mukherjee, 58, is found, Pramod Unde, currently Chief Operating Officer of the Iron Ore Business, would be heading the business. 

 Mukherjee could not be reached for comments. A company spokesperson did not take calls seeking comments on the matter. 

 Mukherjee is credited with making Sesa Goa India's top private sector iron ore miner by expanding company's operations many folds. Under him, the company saw its peak and possibly its worst period as well. At its peak in 2010-11, Sesa Goa had reported a turnover of Rs 10,152 crore and profit of Rs 4,222 crore. 

 However, imposition of mining bans, first in Karnataka and later in Goa, had a debilitating effect on the company, which is now known as Iron Ore Business of Sesa Sterlite and has led to company reporting a negative EBITDA of 148 crore in the April-December, 2013. 

 Industry sources said that Mukherjee wanted to demit office last year itself but was persuaded to continue as he was leading from the front during the mining ban. While operations in Karnataka has resumed, mining ban in Goa is expected to be lifted soon. 

 A mining industry veteran, Mukherjee has been with Sesa Goa (now Sesa Sterlite) since 1987 and was its Managing Director since April, 2006. He continued as MD of the Goa- based mining firm even after Vedanta group acquired it in 2007 from Japan's Mitsui & Co. 

 Last year in August, when Sesa Sterlite came into existence after merger of Sterlite Industries and some other Vedanta group firms into Sesa Goa, Mukherjee was appointed Executive Director (Iron Ore Business) of the company. 

 His contract with the company is valid till March, 2015. Future moves of Mukherjee are not yet known, though some company officials said that for the time being, he would not be joining any firm and pursue his interests in football and music.

Centralised online system for investor grievances:SEBI,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/centralised-online-system-for-investor-grievancessebi/articleshow/7495129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Centralised online system for investor grievances:SEBI,"
  NEW DELHI: Faced with a herculean task of managing and resolving lakhs of investor complaints, market regulator Sebi is putting in place a web-based centralised system for speedy redressal of these grievances.
  
  Sebi's existing investor grievance redressal mechanism lacks a centralised database and the resolution of the complaints often gets delayed due to physical movement of files from one desk to the another across its various offices.
  
  Besides reducing time gap between receipt and redressal of a complaint, the new system would also help in storage of the investor grievances, whose numbers have swelled to over 2.7 million since Sebi's inception, a senior official said.
  
  Sebi had received more than 32,300 investor complaints in 2009-10, while the numbers are even higher at over 39,600 in the first nine months of the current fiscal.
  
  However, the number of complaints are lower as compared to close to 55,000 in 2007-08 and more than 57,500 in 2008-09.
  
  During 2009-10, total 42,742 grievances were redressed, while more than 38,000 complaints were resolved till December in 2010-11.
  
  The Sebi board, in its meeting last week, took note of the ""herculean task"" of storage, maintenance and retrieval of the records related to investor grievances and deliberated over measures to improvise the system, the official added.
  
  The board, which also comprises nominees from the government, was told that Sebi was in the process of upgrading its investor grievance redressal mechanism by setting up the web-based centralised system.
  
  To be called Sebi Complaints Redress System (SCORES), the new system would have a centralised tracking system for all grievances at various offices and divisions of Sebi.
  
  Currently, the list of investor grievances are maintained at various divisions and regional offices of Sebi.
  
  Complaints are also received in various physical and electronic formats.
  
  The new system would also facilitate lodging of complaints pertaining to any of the regional Sebi offices from anywhere.
  
  All the grievances and Action Taken Reports would be in electronic mode and linked to the central server.
  
  Besides, the investors would be able to access online the status of their complaints, including the action taken, if any, on their grievances.
  
  The official said the new system would reduce grievance process time, as physical movements of the complaints would no more be required.

Sebi considers proposal on cross-currency futures pairs,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-considers-proposal-on-cross-currency-futures-pairs/articleshow/48949882.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi considers proposal on cross-currency futures pairs,"MUMBAI: Punters could soon get to trade in cross-currency futures pairs at a much cheaper cost on local bourses. Capital market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which regulates currency derivatives jointly with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is mulling a proposal by stock exchanges to offer these pairs in addition to dollar- and eurorupee futures they currently offer.
 
 ""We are considering the proposal as we want to introduce new products and are in discussions with the RBI,"" said a regulatory official aware of the development. ""Once the central bank approves it, exchanges could launch cross-currency pairs like dollar-euro, dollar-pound and dollar-yen.""
 
 Currency derivatives were launched first on NSE and the erstwhile MCX Stock Exchange, now MSEI, in 2008. Currently, punters can take a view on how the rupee will move against the dollar, euro, yen and pound on bourses like NSE, BSE and MSEI.
 
 Currency brokers like Suresh Nair, director at Admisi Forex, said, if allowed, the move would reduce one leg of a transaction for traders and reduce transaction costs.
 
 For instance, if one has a view that the dollar would rise against the euro, currently she has to sell the rupee and buy the dollar, or go long dollar-rupee. In the second leg she sells the euro and buys the rupee, effectively making her long dollar and short euro.
 
 If bourses launch new cross-currency pairs, a trader who feels the dollar would rise versus the euro could simply go long dollar and short euro. This will save her brokerage on the extra leg and reduce transaction costs, too.
 
 ""At times it has been observed that the dollar, while not exhibiting much movement against the rupee, moves sharply against the euro or the yen. If one wants to take a future view on the dollar-euro or dollar-yen, they would have to either long/short dollar-rupee and short/long euro-rupee. If indeed the RBI permits new cross-currency pairs for being traded, it will increase interest in currency derivatives and raise the combined turnover of all the exchanges,"" said Harish Galipelli, head of currency at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities.
 
 While regulators approved currency derivatives primarily to offer an alternate and cheaper hedging option, than the OTC market, to small and medium scale industry, brokers say, it has been largely a speculative play, with proprietary trades accounting for almost 60 per cent of turnover.
 
 Jamal Mecklai, CEO of Mecklai Financial, a forex consultancy, attributes this to an SME having to eventually convert its forex inflow or outflow with an authorise dealer (bank), where it might not get as attractive a rate it does for hedging in the futures market. Besides, on the futures market liquidity is restricted to the front and the next month contracts; far month contracts being relatively less traded. ""Cross-currency futures will probably attract more punters than genuine users as the current experience proves,"" added Mecklai.
 
 In the week through Friday, combined currency derivatives turnover of NSE, BSE and MSEI (erstwhile MCX-SX) was Rs 1.22 lakh crore. NSE led with a market share of around 62 per cent, BSE at 32.5 per cent and MSEI the rest.

Sebi plans new norms for municipal bonds,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/sebi-plans-new-norms-for-municipal-bonds/articleshow/37008645.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Sebi plans new norms for municipal bonds,"NEW DELHI: To provide new investment avenues to public and institutional players, market regulator Sebi is working on fresh guidelines for municipal bonds -- a popular financial product in developed countries like the US.
 
 The market for municipal bonds, also known as 'muni bonds', is yet to take off in India even though few municipalities here have offered such products in the past, while Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in Gujarat was the first to launch such a bond way back in 1998.
 
 Muni bonds are very popular among investors in many developed nations, especially the United States, where muni bonds have attracted investments totalling over USD 500 billion and are among preferred avenues for household savings.
 
 These bonds are issued by urban local bodies to finance infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation. They serve as an efficient tool for local bodies to mop up funds and can be extensively tapped to meet funding needs of urbanisation.
 
 While there is already an existing framework for issuance of muni bonds, including by the Ministry of Urban Development, there are no unified norms to bolster this nascent market.
 
 When asked about municipal bonds, Sebi chairman U K Sinha said there is a ""preliminary thinking"" at the capital markets regulator and other authorities would be consulted soon.
 
 ""It will have to be a joint effort of Sebi, Ministry of Finance and of course the concerned state government. Preliminary thinking is there ... may be after a couple of months, especially when some of the programmes from the government are very well known. Everyone are waiting for budget announcements, things will move in that direction,"" Sinha said on the sidelines of an event over the weekend.
 
 The fresh push for muni bonds also comes at a time when the regulators and government are looking at ways to channelise household savings into the market to boost overall economic growth.
 
 India's savings rate stood at little over 30 per cent of the GDP in 2012-13 fiscal while household savings rate was nearly 22 per cent during the same period.
 
 In India, muni bonds were issued for the first time by a municipality in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 Way back in 1998, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had become the first municipality to come out with muni bonds. Since then few others, including Greater Vishakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, had issued such bonds.
 
 India would need more than USD 800 billion investments to cater to the urban infrastructure needs over two decades, as per industry chamber Assocham, and muni bonds can serve as an effective fund-raising instrument in this regard.
 
 Besides the US, other countries with a developed muni bond market include Canada and Russia.

Sebis reading of control issue confounds experts,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-reading-of-control-issue-confounds-experts/articleshow/29128499.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi’s reading of ‘control’ issue confounds experts,"MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi’s informal guidance on the issue of control of a company in case of R System International and Bhavook Tripathi has baffled corporate lawyers. 

 In its interpretative letter, Sebi has said that unless the shareholder actually acquires control of the company, he would be considered a public shareholder. A Delhi-based software company R System International has requested Sebi not to classify Bhavook Tripathi, who holds 34.82% in the company, as a public shareholder since by virtue of his holding, Tripathi can influence the company in a significant way. R System pleaded that one of the ways in which Tripathi can exercise such influence is by his ability to block matters requiring shareholders’ nod by way of a special resolution under the Company’s Act 1956. 

 Sebi, while informally terming the acquirer as a non-promoter, seems to have given credence to the fact that there’s still no clarity on the control of the company. “I don’t think Sebi’s informal guidance in case of R System International is correct,” said Huzzefa Nasikwala, founder, Nasikwala Law Chambers. 

 “In India, there’s no yardstick to define promoters in terms of their stake, as persons with as low as 25% can control a company. 

 On the other hand, a person who can influence the company in a significant way with over one-third stake, has been treated as a public shareholder,” he added. In R System, Tripathi made an open offer and his stake rose to 34.82%. While the promoters held 50.17%, thereby leaving the public shareholding at 15%, which is less than the required minimum of 25%. According to the Sebi takeover regulations, the acquirer was required to cut stake to ensure the target company complies with the minimum public holding norm of 25%. But if the acquirer is treated as public shareholder, he is not required to reduce his shareholding in the company. 

 This is somewhat different from the regulator’s stance in other cases such as Subhkam Investments and Clearwater where Sebi had been critical and strict on the issue of ‘control’. The issues raised in the recent informal guidance on R System International signals certain broader trends in the regulatory thought-process, say lawyers. 

 “If the current informal guidance can be seen as Sebi’s relaxation of its past stance, then probably large investors in future should not face Sebi’s stiff resistance while showcasing that merely because of their substantial shareholding, they should not be construed as exercising control over the company and tagged as a promoter,” said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal. While the Sebi informal guidance favours potential acquirers, it leaves some possibilities and many questions open, say corporate lawyers. 

 “It may be possible for a single investor to hold a significant stake and still be treated as part of the public,” said U Umakanth, a corporate law expert. “However, the question as to whether such a large shareholding through which negative control can be exercised by blocking special resolutions would amount to ‘control’ has not been specifically answered, though one can deduce from the result of the informal guidance that Sebi does not believe this to amount to ‘control’.

20 companies approach Sebi with public offer proposals,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/20-companies-approach-sebi-with-public-offer-proposals/articleshow/45639851.cms,m.economictimes.com,20 companies approach Sebi with public offer proposals,"NEW DELHI: Looking to tap into the upbeat investor sentiment, as many as 20 companies including Videocon D2H, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd and Adlabs Entertainment have filed initial papers with market regulator Sebi for their public offers. 

 Since January this year, 20 companies have filed their draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with Sebi to launch an initial public offer (IPO), while SMC Global Securities Ltd sought Sebi's approval for its follow-on public offer (FPO). 

 Barring Sharda Cropchem and GMR Energy, other 18 firms filed their initial papers after the general election verdict was announced in mid-May. 

 Sharda Cropchem filed its draft document in February and GMR Energy sought Sebi's approval in March. However, GMR Energy withdrew its application in April. 

 Of these firms, Sebi has already given nod to the IPOs of Lavasa Corporation, Adlabs Entertainment, Ortel Communications and MEP Infrastructure Developers. However, these four companies are yet to launch their public offers. 

 Besides, the regulator has sought clarification or additional information from the merchant bankers of some of the companies. 

 Most of the companies plan to utilise IPO proceeds for capacity expansion as well as working capital requirements. 

 Of these 20 firms, only two companies -- Sharda Cropchem and Monte Carlo Fashions -- got listed on the stock exchanges. 

 According to market experts, landslide victory of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the general elections has perked up investor sentiment and prompted companies to file IPO papers. 

 Analysts expect a spurt in IPO market next year because many firms which has received Sebi's approval may launch their public offers in 2015. 

 So far in 2014, the 30-share benchmark Sensex has gained over 28 per cent spurred by robust fund flows and revival of risk appetite amid signs of improving economic conditions.

Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/minimum-shareholding-norm-not-for-non-controlling-entity-sebi/articleshow/28560945.cms,m.economictimes.com,Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,"MUMBAI: A non-promoter entity can't be asked to reduce stake in a listed company if its purchase of shares, without acquiring control of the firm, leads to non-compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 The views have been expressed by market regulator Sebi in an 'interpretive letter' issued to a company, R Systems International, which had sought an 'informal guidance' on this matter in relation to purchase of a significant stake by a non-promoter entity. 

 Sebi noted that the non-promoter entity belonged to the category of public shareholders since ""the prime objective behind the acquisition is the investment value in the equity shares of the target company (R Systems) and not substantial holding of shares/voting rights/control or management of the target company. 

 ""Therefore until and unless the acquirer actually acquires control of the target company, the acquirer would be considered as public."" 

 As per the company submissions, Bhvook Tripathi, a non-promoter entity, had acquired shares of the firm that increased his stake in the company to over 30 per cent and resulted in fall of public shareholding below the 25 per cent prescribed limit. 

 R Systems had sought Sebi's views on whether the share purchase by Tripathi will be treated as part of the non-public holding of the company and if so will the acquirer be required to reduce its stake in the company to ensure compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 As per Sebi rules, an entity is obligated to bring down its shareholding to the level specified for maximum permissible non-public shareholding (75 per cent) within a stipulated time. 

 However, in the case of R Systems, Sebi noted that Tripathi belonged to the category of public shareholder as he was neither a promoter nor a person acting in concert with the promoters and had bought shares for investment purposes and not for acquiring control in the company. 

 Moreover, Sebi said that going by the shareholding pattern of R Systems for quarter ending September 2013, Tripathi was listed as a public shareholder. 

 ""The expression acquirer has been defined as any person who directly or indirectly acquires shares or voting rights in or control over a target company either by himself, or through or with any person acting in concert with him. 

 ""As per the definition the acquirer means any person which is includes both promoter and public,"" Sebi said.

 The QCCP status will make the three clearing corporations comply with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI), an international standard to handle counterparty risk on derivatives, Sebi said in a statement issued today. 

 ""These (clearing corporations) are also subjected, on an on-going basis, to rules and regulations that are consistent with the PFMI issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),"" Sebi said. 

 The international standards were issued in April 2012 and all G-20 nations were to required to adhere to these strict standards to check derivative-related risks in the financial system. 

 These rules were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, settlement, and recording arrangements, and more broadly, to limit systemic risk and foster transparency and financial stability. 

 QCCP is an entity that is licensed to operate as a central counterparty (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption) and is permitted by the appropriate regulator to operate as such with respect to the products offered. 

 Clearing Corporations undertakes the activity of clearing and settlement of trades in securities or other instruments or products that are dealt with or traded on stock exchanges. 

 Yesterday, Reserve Bank had granted QCCP status to Clearing Corporation of India.

Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-mulls-prudential-governance-norms-for-stock-brokers/articleshow/43069625.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,"NEW DELHI: After prescribing a new Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, capital markets watchdog Sebi is now mulling over a new set of Prudential Governance Norms for stock brokers to safeguard investors' interest. 

 The proposed norms, which are currently at draft stage and are going through consultations, would considerably enhance the disclosure requirements by stock brokers and can subject them to tightened regulations with regard to related party transactions and audit of their books and other dealings. 

 Besides, the brokers may also be required to put in place a whistle-blower mechanism and frame an effective 'code of conduct' for their directors and senior management personnel, in line with similar norms for listed companies as prescribed by Sebi and in the new Companies Act, sources said. 

 These norms have been proposed by Sebi to ensure that any adverse impact on the interest on investors as well as on the integrity of securities markets can be avoided in the event of any lapses at the end of stock broker. 

 Sebi is aiming to ""minimise/prevent occurrence of circumstances leading to default in making payments by stock brokers to stock exchanges or clients due to lack of due diligence in their risk management system, due to mis-management leading to instability or failure in operations of stock broker including insolvency etc"" with these norms. 

 The new corporate governance norms for listed companies are coming into effect from October 1. However, Sebi recently relaxed some provisions after representations from the industry bodies and the government and it has given time till April 1, 2015 for a key provision of having minimum one woman director on the boards of listed companies. 

 A senior official said that the brokers have also already begun making representations before the regulator with concerns that any tightening of corporate governance norms could hurt their business due to high compliance costs. 

 The brokers are arguing that they are already operating in a highly regulated business and the new Companies Act has already provided for significant tightening of norms for the corporate brokerage firms. 

 Among others, the proposed norms would require brokers to submit their audited annual reports within 60 days of end of a financial year and a half-yearly networth certificate within two months of the end of a half-year to the stock exchange. 

 The quarterly financial results would be required to be submitted within 45 days of end of each quarter, while annual audit would need to be done by ""an independent, competent and qualified auditor"". 

 No stock broker would be allowed to re-appoint an individual as an auditor for more than one term for five consecutive years. In case of an audit firm, it can be appointed for maximum two terms of five consecutive terms. 

 In their periodic financial disclosures, the brokers would have to separately mention the advance or margins received from their clients, as also any advance or loans given by them. 

 Details of loans, advances or investments in subsidiaries, associates or group companies, as also all material information about their financial position, performance, governance and ownership, would need specific disclosures. 

 The brokers would also need to disclose all exceptional income and expenditure, along with auditors' observations, while their quarterly and annual financial results would need to be approved by the board of director and CEO/CFO along with a certification of ""absence of falsity or omission"". 

 The board of directors would need to lay down a code of conduct for all board members and senior management of the company, and also devise an effective whistle blower mechanism enabling all stakeholders, including employees, to freely communicate their concerns about any illegal or unethical practices. 

 The board would have to ensure that the interest of a whistle-blower is not prejudicially affected. 

 With regard to investor grievance, a compliance officer would need to ensure that they are redressed in a stipulated manner and within a given timeline. The status of all investor complaints would need to be reviewed and analysed every six months and corrective steps would be required to be taken by the compliance officer to ""minimise recurrence in future"". 

 The CEO of the company would need to certify that ""there are no transaction entered into by the stock broker during the year which are fraudulent, illegal or violating the stock broker's code of conduct"". 

 The certification would also include that the auditor has been informed about any significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting or in accounting policies, as also about the ""instances of significant fraud of which they have become aware and the involvement therein, if any, of the management or an employee"".

 Sebi had earlier ordered attachment of bank accounts and demat accounts of -- Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Prem M Parikh, Bharat S Thakkar, Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Hemant Kumar Motihar -- to recover the penalties imposed on them for violation of capital market norms. 

 In separate release orders issued this month, the market watchdog said it has recovered Rs 33.44 lakh from Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Rs 7.1 lakh from Prem M Parikh, Rs 6.46 lakh from Bharat S Thakkar, Rs 4.54 lakh from Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Rs 2.57 lakh from Hemant Kumar Motihar. 

 Together these dues amount to Rs 54.14 lakh. They include interest and other expenses along with the penalties. 

 Stating that it had collected ""full and final settlement of the dues"" from the defaulters, Sebi directed the banks and depositories - NSDL and CDSL - to defreeze the accounts of the entities. 

 ""...you are hereby directed to release the bank accounts/ lockers/demat accounts, of the defaulter attached, if any, pursuant to the notice of attachment,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in the release orders. 

 Till July-end, the market regulator was able to recover penalties worth nearly Rs 7 crore from several defaulters. 

 Sebi had began passing orders earlier this year to defreeze bank accounts and demat accounts of entities which made the payment of outstanding dues. 

 The capital markets watchdog began initiating attachment proceedings against defaulters, including individuals and companies, in October last as per the greater powers granted to it through an ordinance promulgated by the government. 

 Since then, the Sebi has launched nearly 1,400 attachment proceedings for recovery of penalties imposed in as many as 393 cases. These proceedings involve attachment of bank accounts, movable and immovable properties, shares and debentures, among others. 

 The market regulator is looking to recover penalties aggregating to nearly Rs 1,700 crore imposed on various entities.

 The proposed study will also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others. 

 The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by capital markets regulator Sebi for the next financial year beginning April 1, 2014, for which it has identified 'capacity building' as a core focus area, a senior official said. 

 According to the proposed move, a comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to understand the ""trend/pattern discovery by regulators in developed markets like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong"" in order to keep pace with the ever increasing globalisation of Indian markets. 

 ""The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc,"" the official added. 

 In 2014-15, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) also plans to organise an International Research Conference with an aim to commence a dialogue on ways to tackle newer challenges faced by securities markets by ameliorating the pool of research talent around the world. 

 Sebi, which was established on April 12, 1988, has also proposed to organise a Foundation Day lecture each year, beginning the next fiscal by inviting a Nobel laureate or an eminent person from the fields like economics and finance to talk on relevant issues for securities markets. 

 With regard to Sebi's capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously. 

 At present, Sebi's average training budget per person per year is the lowest among all its peer regulators, while the area of skill development also needs a further fillip. 

 While Sebi is already working on increasing its staff strength in a gradual manner from about 700 currently, it is looking to achieve quality enhancement of staff through better training and skill enhancement measures, so as to further bolster the supervisory and regulatory capacity of the organisation.

"Sebi, exchanges to tighten grip on speculative stocks",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-exchanges-to-tighten-grip-on-speculative-stocks/articleshow/41135774.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi, exchanges to tighten grip on speculative stocks","MUMBAI: The capital market regulator and stock exchanges are planning to tighten their grip over small-cap and penny stocks that are susceptible to manipulation. The Securities and Exchange Board of India and the bourses may introduce a new segment called T+ Group, under which margin requirements would be steep and circuit filters would be lower.
 
 At present, stock exchanges try to prevent manipulation by transferring them to the trade-to-trade segment or T Group.. In this segment, traders have to take delivery of the shares they buy, while the daily maximum tradable limit is 5% on either side.
 
 Exchanges shift stocks to the T Group when there is speculation and unusual movement on the back of higher-than-average volumes. These requirements result in a fall in unnatural activity in such shares. The plan to introduce a new segment comes on the heels of reports of manipulation in stock prices during inclusion into or exclusion from the T Group.
 
 The T+ Group would include shares that have been in the T Group for over three months and whose price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is less than 250 and book value is less than 30 times, said a source familiar with the matter. “Exchanges have got complaints that there is still a lot of manipulation despite stocks being shifted to the T Group. So, they felt there is a need for a new group,” said a source in the know.
 
 Under the T+ Group, margin requirement of 500% and 100% will be introduced on sell and buy transactions respectively. Funds and shares wo
uld be released by the clearing corporation of the exchange only after a month, while the circuit filter would be even lesser than 5%. It has also been proposed that at the time of review, the companies having a P/E greater than 50 times or price-to-book greater than 10 times, will be eligible for moving out of T+ Group to T Group.
 
 Earlier this month, bourses moved almost 550 stocks out of the T Group after they were convinced that speculation has receded. The T Group was introduced shortly after the Ketan Parekh scam in 2001 but the detailed norms of how, when and why shares would be put under surveillance were not disclosed until November 2010.

  Sandeep Wagle, Founder & MD, APTART Technical Advisory Services, www.aptartindia.com spoke to ET Now on SBI.
  
  
  What are your views on SBI?
  
  There is nothing in the chart. Till it breaks 2400, I do not see a big move. I do not see that happening very soon but I do not see it cracking down, going below 2270-2280. So broadly 2270-2350, that is the range.
  
  
  What do you make out of generally in terms of the midcap side of the market?
  
  We have had decent moves in midcaps also, but I would agree that it has been very specific and selective. You did not have a whole host of midcaps moving, but even in the banking space, you have a State Bank which is sideways but you have a Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank which is ready to move 5-7% even from current levels. So it is more of choosing and picking of stocks. It is not this or that. Some of this, some of that is what I feel.

ET Now: What is your call on SBI?  Mitesh Thacker: If somebody sold out of the money calls, square them off. If somebody has written out of the money puts also, square them off. The Bank Nifty has broken down. SBI is a very important constituent of that index. A lot of other PSU banking stocks are showing weak patterns. If somebody was short at 1950 or 2000 strike call option, we will hardly have any premium left. So, it make sense to cover them up.  Plus 1650 broadly was a strike where some put writing was observed earlier but that has been covered up with the fact that stock prices are now trading below those levels. So, I would not remain long on SBI or any other banking stocks via the futures or the options route for the time being. Cover up all positions of SBI.

"Saudi market opens, may affect global fund flows",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/saudi-market-opens-may-affect-global-fund-flows/articleshow/47672381.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Saudi market opens, may affect global fund flows","BY Maria Levitov 
 
 LONDON: Come Monday, global equity markets will wake up to a new $558 billion magnet pulling cash out of developing nations from Russia to Malaysia. 

 As Saudi Arabia lifts a ban on direct investments by foreigners, fund allocators are preparing to shift money out of other countries and put it to work in the Arab world's largest stock market. While there's little consensus on which country will be the biggest loser, money managers mostly agree that energy producers will feel the heaviest effects. Below are the views of seven emerging-markets investors and strategists on what to expect: 

 Martial Godet, head of emergingmarket equities and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas SA in Paris: 

 Saudi Arabia “will not be a bargain, but it can be a nice diversification from emerging Asia that has become increasingly large within emerging markets. The biggest losers will be markets associated with oil and energy: Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia.“ 

 Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging-markets strategist at NN Investment Partners in The Hague: 

 “Investors will eventually sell a bit across the board to get to a decent weight in Saudi Arabia. There might be a bit more selling in other oil countries, but then we should ask ourselves what are the pure oil plays in emerging-markets, comparable to Saudi Arabia? Only Russia comes close.“ 

 Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital in London: 

 “The UAE and Qatar may suffer. After Saudi Arabia's inclusion in MSCI EM, investors might think: why bother looking at small Qatar when you can choose Saudi to be your Gulf proxy?“ 

 James Bannan, who oversees the $150 million Frontier Markets Fund at Coeli Asset Management in Mal mo, Sweden: 

 “Most of the large frontier-market funds already have decent exposure to Saudi Arabia. If they were to increase their exposure, it would come from allocations in the region, namely Kuwait, the UAE., Qatar and Oman.“ 

 Rami Sidani, the head of frontier markets at Schroder Investment Management in Dubai: 

 “The event of Saudi Arabia opening up is a very positive development for the entire Gulf region, as it graduates to becoming an investment destination for emerging-market funds. The Gulf market won't be able to be disregarded by international investors as an asset class.“ 

 Julian Mayo, co-chief investment officer at Charlemagne Capital in London: 

 “This move will gradually benefit Saudi in the next two years, as Saudi becomes investible to a wider range of investors, but we don't expect any specific market to suffer as a result of this move. Ultimately, stock performance depends on fundamentals of earnings and valuations.“ 

 Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, the head of the Europe, Middle East, Africa and global frontier markets equity team at Baring Investment Services in London: 

 “I don't think there is going to be a massive knock-on effect to start with from the day of the opening, as the market is being opened in a very limited way with a lot of requirements for anyone wanting to go into the market directly. We are already in Saudi Arabia. It's an out-ofindex position in my fund, which is around 20 %.""

  AHMEDABAD: Vadodara-based Sanghvi Forging and Engineering (SFE) Ltd today said it expects to raise Rs 36.90 crore through its initial public offering (IPO) opening tomorrow.
  
  The company has fixed a price band of its IPO between Rs 80 and Rs 85. The issue opens for subscription on May 4 and closes on May 6 for QIB investors and on May 9 for the non-institutional investors (NII) and retail bidders.

  ""We are expanding the capacity of our 4 metric tonne (MT) single forging unit. A project with single piece forging capacity of 40 MT will be set up at an investment of Rs 120 crore,"" SFE Director of International Sales Naresh Sanghvi told PTI.
  
  The company is an approved global vendor of General Electric (GE) and it has obtained an approval of Mazagaon Dock, a GoI enterprise manufacturing submarines and vessels for defence, and Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, he added.
  
  ""The company has secured term loan of Rs 50 crore and Rs 22 crore from the State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, respectively for the project, while Rs 36.90 crore shall be raised through this IPO to part finance the project,"" Sanghvi said.
  
  ""In a pre-IPO placement, the company has sold close to seven lakh equity shares at Rs 80 per piece to a German company Dango & Dinethal Mascinenbau (GMBH), with the lock in period of one year,"" he said.
  
  The company turnover stood at Rs 29.50 crore in the third quarter of 2010-11 ending December, of which 20 per cent accounts for exports. It reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 3 crore.
  
  The company will begin manufacturing critical products like rotors for turbine, tube sheets for oil and gas, shafts for ship building, shafts for heavy engineering, which currently are being imported from Korea, Italy and Japan, Sanghvi said.
  
  The products find application in the shipping industry, defence, oil and gas sector and for space application purposes.
  
  Competing with players like Bharat Forge, which had recently set up a plant of similar capacity to meet the growing demand for such products; it targets to maintain exports of 20 per cent of the total turnover.
  
  The Indian forging industry has grown at a CAGR of 15.6 per cent between 2001-2008 period, while the exports sales during the same period grew at CAGR of 25.1 per cent.

Soiles Bhattacharya takes interim charge of SAIL,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/soiles-bhattacharya-takes-interim-charge-of-sail/articleshow/5998976.cms,m.economictimes.com,Soiles Bhattacharya takes interim charge of SAIL,"
  NEW DELHI: Soiles Bhattacharya today took over as the interim chairman of steel maker SAIL after incumbent S K Roongta superannuated.
  
  ""Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) informs that S K Roongta ceases to be the chairman of SAIL with effect from May 31, 2010, on attaining the age of superannuation,"" the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  ""Further, the company informs that Soiles Bhattacharya Director (Finance) SAIL has been given the additional charge of Chairman SAIL,"" it added.
  
  Bhattacharya is the senior most director in SAIL. Official sources said that he has been given the additional charge for a period of three months or until further orders are issued.
  
  The steel ministry had to appoint an interim chairman, as there were delays in approval of state-owned BHEL's C S Verma for the top job in the steel PSU. Government's headhunter Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Verma for the post of chairman of SAIL.
  
  While most of the clearances for Verma were in place, his appointment was not yet confirmed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), pending which Bhattacharya has been appointed as the interim chairman.
  
  A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said that recently certain clarifications were sought from the ACC over appointment of a new chairman of SAIL.
  
  ""The Steel Ministry has already sent its reply on Verma's appointment to the ACC,"" he added.
  
  Steel minister Virbhadra Singh had last month said that he has already approved Verma's name for the post of SAIL chairman and recommended the same to the ACC.
  
  Bhattacharya assumes the responsibility of the country's largest steel firm at a time, which analysts say could be ""a very difficult time for the steel industry"", which is hit by rising prices of raw material like iron ore and coking coal and slackening demand ahead of the monsoon.

  NEW DELHI: State-run Steel Authority of India, or Sail, the country’s largest steel producer, has initiated the process for its Rs. 7,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO) and is planning to enter the market by March end or early April.
  
  The issue that was scheduled to enter the market in the second week of February was delayed after the state-run company objected to the conflict of interest of four investment bankers advising the issue. These bankers had also accepted a mandate for Tata Steel, which entered the market in January. The company had issued notices to these bankers alleging that advising Tata Steel, which was also from the same sector, amounted to conflict of interest. 
  
  “The issue with the bankers have been resolved and we will attempt to enter the market by the end of March, depending upon the market condition,” SAIL chairman CS Verma told ET.
  
  On Thursday, the department of disinvestments met senior officials of steel ministry, SAIL and representatives of six investment bankers to give the green signal for the FPO. “Bankers have done significant due diligence on the mandate. It will take two more weeks to prepare the prospectus that will be filed with the Sebi,” a banker told ET.
  
  The exact timing of the issue will depend upon the Rs. 12,000-crore share sale by exploration behemoth Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, a senior official of the department of disinvestments said. The proposed issue comprises 5% of fresh issue by the company and a share sale of a similar amount by the government.

Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-swings-hand-arbitrage-advantage-to-day-traders/articleshow/45635008.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,"MUMBAI: With the rupee turning volatile against the dollar, day traders have tapped an arbitrage opportunity within a short span between the exchange traded futures and domestic over-the-counter forward markets. 

 The intensity on Tuesday was about 5-10 paise compared with zero to three paise a week or two ago in the 1-month contract category. Traders were seen buying the January contract in the dollar-rupee pair at about 63.82/$ while selling the similar maturity forward contract at 63.87-63.88. The gap, or spread, was on the higher end in other pairs like euro-rupee or pound-rupee or yen-rupee. 

 “Traders have initiated fresh long positions for the last two weeks as the rupee has turned volatile,” said Sajal Gupta - head (forex and interest rate), Edelweiss Financial Services. 

 “Earlier, they were enjoying premium of a stable exchange rate. Intra-day sharp volatility led to some arbitrage opportunities.” The average daily futures volume has nearly doubled to 11,300 crore compared with 6,050 crore in the first fortnight of the month, show data from NSE. 

 Between December 15 and 23, the rupee has swung from 62.46 to 63.89 per dollar, a movement as high as 2.29%, or 143 paise. 

 “After being ranged and quiet for nearly five months, dollar/rupee sprang to life since the first week of December,” said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities. “Since then, turnover or participation has increased in all the three pillars of financial markets, viz., speculators, arbitrageurs and hedgers have become active.” 

 Over the past one week, the offshore non-deliverable forward market has been tepid as most traders have gone on leave ahead of year-end festivities globally. 

 The spreads, or gaps, with non-deliverable forward (NDF) from two domestic markets have shrunk to near zero from eight or 10 paise discount earlier. This, too, has fuelled arbitrages between domestic futures and forwards. Futures, forwards and NDFs all are the rupee derivatives. 

 Such large arbitrage opportunities have been lapped up by traders, which has helped in pumping up the volume on the exchange, dealers said. “We have seen arbitrage between futures and forward markets whenever there is demand-supply mismatch and sudden exchange rate volatility,” said Abhishek Goenka, founder & CEO, India Forex Advisors. 

 Arbitrage opportunities wane as and when the exchange rate turns to a particular trending, be it down or up instead of sharp swings. Traders’ rush to tap such opportunities is also being blamed. 

 “That too has not lasted long, as players have captured the difference and consequently, the contracts on OTC and exchange are now almost back at parity,” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, the local unit trended down against the greenback to close the day’s trading at 63.52 per dollar, weakened 0.38% from a day earlier. 

 Oil companies were seen buying dollars in the domestic forwards to meet their month-end demand.

The entity could be a trust or a corporate entity as well, said Sanjiv Goenka, the group’s chairman. This trust will set up center for excellences in the areas of education, skills development and healthcare. Goenka was talking to reporters on the eve of 84th birthday of RP Goenka. 

 Goenka, who announced RP Goenka scholarship scheme on Friday, said the group has a net profit of around Rs 900 crore. As per the new rule 2 per cent of the net profit should go to CSR activities. ""Our target is to set up one world class institution in every three years,"" he added. RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group could have an yearly corpus of Rs 18 crore for CSR. ""We want to create institutions and do something which is worthwhile instead of fettering it away. We are in the process of creating a trust which will set up bodies like educational and medical institutions. The idea is to create at least one institution in a period of three years. So, within a timespan of a decade we will be able to set up at least three institutions something which the city would be proud of. The trust is not yet been formed, and we are looking at things like the corpus that we can start with. We need a centralised structure to channelise our CSR initiatives ,"" he said. 

 ""We need around Rs 50-55 crore for a world class education or healthcare institution. So in 10 years we can have three. It is better to do something tangible from the CSR fund,” he added. Elaborating about the scholarship, Goenka added that it will offer Rs 60,000 scholarship a year to 30 students in the state initially. More students will be added gradually. 

 ""A student who has secured at least minimum 85 per cent marks in 2014 class 12 examination will be eligible for the scholarship. The idea is to support the student till it finishes the bachelors’ degree,"" he added. However,the combined family income of the applicant should not exceed Rs 2.5 lakh per year.

AGM can open new chapter for RIL shareholders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/agm-can-open-new-chapter-for-ril-shareholders/articleshow/6061579.cms,m.economictimes.com,AGM can open new chapter for RIL shareholders,"
  MUMBAI: When Mukesh Ambani steps out of his Black Mercedes, with wife Nita Ambani in tow, on Friday, to chair the annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries (RIL), it could mark the beginning of a new chapter not only for the Ambani family, but the extended family of 3.5 million RIL shareholders.
  
  Many thoughts would cross Mukesh's mind before he proceeds for the 36th AGM, being held at the Birla Matoshree auditorium in south Mumbai, as the company embarks on a new journey of going beyond its traditional business of oil refining to enter new sectors like power, telecom and financial services. These were the very sectors which RIL was barred from entering after the Reliance empire was split between the two brothers . Now, with the truce in place, the AGM would put an official seal on the patch-up , something which shareholders having been hoping to witness for a long time.
  
  What began as a bitter period of animosity between the Ambani brothers five years ago, could well come to an end on Friday, if Anil Ambani attends, something which no one is confirming but everyone is talking about. Anil is expected to represent himself as an ‘ordinary shareholder' , this time to express his gratitude for the truce agreement between RIL and his group.
  
  
  Shareholders expect big announcements
  
  The AGM of RIL would mark a breakaway from what shareholders saw at the August 2005 AGM, when an emotional Anil Ambani had said: ‘‘ Today, it is a very emotional day for me as I stand here with the blessings of my beloved mother Kokilaben . She has given birth to me twice. First, on June 4, 1959 and the second one on June 18, 2005. Both Mukesh and I could not be in front of you without her support and blessings.” Perhaps, June 18, 2010 would mark another rebirth for Anil.
  
  Ironically, he had sought his elder brother's blessings even then, when he was getting started on building his own empire. In all probability , this year's AGM could be like a ‘home coming' for Anil and his family, given the thaw in relations between the two factions.Shareholders could indeed witness a special ‘Kodak ’ moment if the two families happen to be seated together in the front row, just like old times.
  
  However, one sticky subject which Mukesh could touch upon at the AGM is the gas pricing issue for ADAG's power business. Mukesh had, in past AGMs, briefed shareholders on the gas dispute, which has been the main bone of contention between the two brothers ever since the Reliance empire was split. Said Shailesh Mehta, an RIL shareholder , who owns 32 shares of the company since it went public in 1977, ‘‘ I’m expecting the chairman to make big announcements at the AGM. We expect a new vision for RIL.”
  
  Clearly, the mood is already upbeat as to what Mukesh would unveil at the AGM.

Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/should-you-opt-for-richly-valued-stocks/articleshow/44867043.cms,m.economictimes.com,Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,"The holy grail of stock market investing has forever remained elusive: fundamentally sound companies trading at cheap valuations. Like all good things in life, the top performers of the equity universe—companies that boast stable cash flows, high profit margins and efficient management, among others—carry the burden of high valuations, with their shares trading at substantial premiums to the broader indices as well as their peers.

This presents a dilemma for investors and experts alike. Some people like Vikas Gupta, executive vice-president, Arthveda Fund Management, questions the obsession with 'quality'. ""People are paying through their nose for these stocks. There is no doubt about the solid fundamentals of these companies, but there is a limit to the premium one should be paying for them,"" he says. Gupta believes such valuations cannot be sustained for long. ""There are other companies that are valued at much lower prices, and when these sectors and companies start showing results, money will be pulled out from the highperforming set of stocks,"" he argues.

Therefore, Gupta cautions investors against blindly buying the so-called highquality stocks. ""Unless there is a strong likelihood of the company's sales doubling within the next 2-3 years, and this positive development has not been factored in in the pricing of the stock, paying such a high price for it just does not make sense,"" Gupta adds.

In spite of the warnings by experts, there is always a good reason to track these fundamentally strong companies that have been commanding rich valuations in the market across time periods because of the opportunities they might throw up. Here, we have restricted our search to the CNX100 universe and included only those high-performing stocks that have been around for the past 10 years (since October 2004). The stock-picking filters left us with 79 stocks. Next, we compared the monthly average price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for each of these stocks against the monthly average PE of the Nifty index for the period under consideration. This exercise revealed the number of occasions on which each stock traded at a premium to the benchmark index, helping us identify the final list of perennially expensive stocks.

We have also compared the 10-year median PE of these stocks with the current PE to check where they stand today in terms of historical valuations. To determine the median, we first sort the list in ascending order, then pick the middle value. Comparing it to the average or mean valuation, the median value is a much more realistic interpretation of the market, especially if the data distribution is asymmetrical, which is the case for many of the stocks under consideration. Let's dig deeper into the final list of eight high-performing stocks and assess where they stand in terms of their fundamentals.

Stocks that have consistently traded at premium valuations

				

Asian Paints

The market leader in the paints business has always commanded a hefty premium in the stock market. Its superior pricing power due to its leadership position has allowed the company to maintain healthy profit margins throughout the past decade.

Over the past 2-3 years, Asian Paints has clocked a steady volume growth of around 10 per cent. With the company's new premium offerings in the fast-growing exterior paints segment, it is likely to maintain its profitability. Currently, the stock is trading at around 50 times the trailing 12-month earnings, compared to the 10-year median PE of 31.5. It is available at 144 per cent premium to the Nifty index PE. With these high valuations, most analysts are emphasising on caution despite the company's superior fundamentals. Says Shirish Pardeshi, head, research, Anand Rathi Securities: ""Though the company continues to report a healthy earnings growth, we believe most of the upside is capped at current valuations.""


	 


Dabur

The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major, Dabur, enjoys a strong presence in the low-penetration and high-growth categories. It is known for its unique positioning, with a suite comprising products derived from ayurvedic and herbal sources. The company's robust fundamentals have naturally been awarded with premium valuations at all times. The stock has historically traded at a PE of around 37 times, but is currently enjoying a valuation multiple of nearly 57 times the trailing 12-month earnings. This stands at a 173 per cent premium to the Nifty index, almost twice its historical premium of 88 per cent. Despite these high valuations, analysts remain bullish on the stock given the company's strong innovation pipeline and high volume growth. Says Abneesh Roy, analyst at Edelweiss Securities: ""The company is in a sweet spot with volume growth ahead of most peers due to its huge innovation funnel, higher ad spends and aggressive distribution drive.""

HDFC

The first specialised housing finance company in the country, HDFC has enjoyed premium valuations over the years due to its consistent track record in earnings and loan book growth. Across economic cycles, its return ratios have remained healthy, with a return on equity of over 20 per cent in the past 10 years. The company's share price has appreciated recently due to the expectations of a merger with its subsidiary, HDFC Bank. Today, the stock trades at 29 times the earnings, which is not too far from its 10-year median PE of around 27. Its premium over the Nifty is at par with its historical valuation premium.

""At the operating level, HDFC continues to deliver superior performance led by strong growth, steady margins and robust asset quality. However, the stock is trading at a premium valuation and the scope for upside is limited,"" says a report from brokerage firm, Sharekhan. It maintains its 'hold' rating on the stock.

HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank has always held sway over the market, enjoying rich valuations. It has been awarded for its consistent track record of clocking over 30 per cent profit growth. However, it has recently seen the valuations fall from a historical context, after failing to match its own lofty standards of earnings growth. The valuation premium over the Nifty index has narrowed significantly compared to its historical premium. Analysts, however, remain positive on the stock. Says Vaibhav Agrawal, vicepresident, research, Angel Broking:

""Though the current earnings trajectory at over 21 per cent year-on-year is lower than its illustrious track record of over 30 per cent earnings growth, it is still impressive and better than other large private peers in light of the current macro environment. A likely economic recovery would reflect in higher loan growth, which, in our view, justifies a premium valuation multiple.""

Kotak Mahindra Bank

This relative newcomer in the banking space has made a mark for itself with its focus on retail loans. It fetches the highest net interest margins in the industry at 4.5 per cent and boasts a better-than-average asset quality, with its net non-performing assets (NPA) of 1 per cent. It grew its loan book at 25 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past five years. Its high loan book growth, strong management and consistently high return ratios have allowed it to enjoy rich valuations.

At 51 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is trading marginally higher than its his torical multiple and is expensive. Analysts, however, remain bullish because of its all-round superiority. Says Manish Ostwal, analyst, KR Choksey Institutional Research: ""We believe that strong core capitalisation, superior margins and asset quality, improving liability franchise with strong market positioning in capitallinked businesses, are the key differentiators for Kotak.""


	 


Titan Company

Jewellery and watchmaker, Titan, is another company that has always been valued on the higher side. Its dominant position in the organised market, aided by unwavering trust from an upwardly mobile and increasingly brand-conscious Indian middle class, has held the company in good stead all these years. The stock has historically traded at twice the valuation of the broader Nifty index, but is currently trading at a premium of 135 per cent. At a PE of 49 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is much more expensive than its 10-year median PE of around 39. Yet, analysts are convinced that the stock has enough potential even at these levels. Says Gautam Duggad, analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities: ""We believe that Titan will be a key beneficiary of the improving macro and urban consumer sentiment. The dominant presence in its core segments, underlying shift towards branded segments in both jewellery and watches, and a strong balance sheet make it a compelling play on rising urban aspirations and, therefore, a preference for branded lifestyle goods.""

Apollo Hospitals 

Apollo is India's largest private healthcare service provider, with an integrated business model that offers an umbrella of services. Apart from hospitals, the company has the largest organised pharmacy retail chain, with around 1,600 stores, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of its total revenue. The healthcare services segment has grown at a healthy CAGR of 17 per cent over the past five years on account of incremental hospital addition, as well as expansion and maturity of older hospitals. The pharmacy business has grown at nearly 33 per cent CAGR in the past five years and is also a candidate for possible value unlocking in the future. The consistent growth has allowed the company to fetch premium valuations at all times. At a trailing PE of 46 times, the stock is trading much higher than its historical valuation of around 34.5 times. Analysts say the stock is not providing much comfort at these levels.

Motherson Sumi Systems

This auto component maker has been on an unmatched growth trajectory over the past decade. Even during the troubled years, when its peers struggled, Motherson was able to protect its revenue base and maintain profitability. In the past, it has set very ambitious five-year growth targets for itself and has gone ahead to achieve them.

Having already achieved its revenue target one year in advance, it appears set to meet its target of 40 per cent return on capital employed (ROCE) by 2015. Given such robust fundamentals, analysts continue to back the stock despite a steep PE multiple of 62 times. Says Kaushal Maroo, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services: ""Over the past five years, the Street's focus on nearterm earnings has possibly lead to it missing the bigger picture. The company has emerged from being an Indian wiring harness maker of repute to being a supplier of rear-view mirrors and polymer products to major European original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

The Nifty Fifty era

The craze over high-quality growth stocks has echoes of a bygone era—the US of the 1960s and 70s—when the Nifty Fifty, a basket of 50 popular stocks, enjoyed an obsessive following by investors. These were widely perceived as solid buy-and-hold growth stocks and their lofty valuations were considered well-justified. While these 50 stocks propelled the US bull market of the early 1970s, the subsequent bear market that lasted till 1982 caused valuations of the Nifty Fifty to fall to low levels along with the rest of the market. Most of these stocks underperformed the broader market averages. While many of these are still good performers (Coca-Cola, Gillette, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble), some have lost their way (Polaroid, Eastman Kodak, Dow Chemical). It should serve as a cautionary tale of unrealistic expectations from growth stocks.

Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/minimum-shareholding-norm-not-for-non-controlling-entity-sebi/articleshow/28560945.cms,m.economictimes.com,Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,"MUMBAI: A non-promoter entity can't be asked to reduce stake in a listed company if its purchase of shares, without acquiring control of the firm, leads to non-compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 The views have been expressed by market regulator Sebi in an 'interpretive letter' issued to a company, R Systems International, which had sought an 'informal guidance' on this matter in relation to purchase of a significant stake by a non-promoter entity. 

 Sebi noted that the non-promoter entity belonged to the category of public shareholders since ""the prime objective behind the acquisition is the investment value in the equity shares of the target company (R Systems) and not substantial holding of shares/voting rights/control or management of the target company. 

 ""Therefore until and unless the acquirer actually acquires control of the target company, the acquirer would be considered as public."" 

 As per the company submissions, Bhvook Tripathi, a non-promoter entity, had acquired shares of the firm that increased his stake in the company to over 30 per cent and resulted in fall of public shareholding below the 25 per cent prescribed limit. 

 R Systems had sought Sebi's views on whether the share purchase by Tripathi will be treated as part of the non-public holding of the company and if so will the acquirer be required to reduce its stake in the company to ensure compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 As per Sebi rules, an entity is obligated to bring down its shareholding to the level specified for maximum permissible non-public shareholding (75 per cent) within a stipulated time. 

 However, in the case of R Systems, Sebi noted that Tripathi belonged to the category of public shareholder as he was neither a promoter nor a person acting in concert with the promoters and had bought shares for investment purposes and not for acquiring control in the company. 

 Moreover, Sebi said that going by the shareholding pattern of R Systems for quarter ending September 2013, Tripathi was listed as a public shareholder. 

 ""The expression acquirer has been defined as any person who directly or indirectly acquires shares or voting rights in or control over a target company either by himself, or through or with any person acting in concert with him. 

 ""As per the definition the acquirer means any person which is includes both promoter and public,"" Sebi said.

 The QCCP status will make the three clearing corporations comply with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI), an international standard to handle counterparty risk on derivatives, Sebi said in a statement issued today. 

 ""These (clearing corporations) are also subjected, on an on-going basis, to rules and regulations that are consistent with the PFMI issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),"" Sebi said. 

 The international standards were issued in April 2012 and all G-20 nations were to required to adhere to these strict standards to check derivative-related risks in the financial system. 

 These rules were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, settlement, and recording arrangements, and more broadly, to limit systemic risk and foster transparency and financial stability. 

 QCCP is an entity that is licensed to operate as a central counterparty (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption) and is permitted by the appropriate regulator to operate as such with respect to the products offered. 

 Clearing Corporations undertakes the activity of clearing and settlement of trades in securities or other instruments or products that are dealt with or traded on stock exchanges.

Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-mulls-prudential-governance-norms-for-stock-brokers/articleshow/43069625.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,"NEW DELHI: After prescribing a new Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, capital markets watchdog Sebi is now mulling over a new set of Prudential Governance Norms for stock brokers to safeguard investors' interest. 

 The proposed norms, which are currently at draft stage and are going through consultations, would considerably enhance the disclosure requirements by stock brokers and can subject them to tightened regulations with regard to related party transactions and audit of their books and other dealings. 

 Besides, the brokers may also be required to put in place a whistle-blower mechanism and frame an effective 'code of conduct' for their directors and senior management personnel, in line with similar norms for listed companies as prescribed by Sebi and in the new Companies Act, sources said. 

 These norms have been proposed by Sebi to ensure that any adverse impact on the interest on investors as well as on the integrity of securities markets can be avoided in the event of any lapses at the end of stock broker. 

 Sebi is aiming to ""minimise/prevent occurrence of circumstances leading to default in making payments by stock brokers to stock exchanges or clients due to lack of due diligence in their risk management system, due to mis-management leading to instability or failure in operations of stock broker including insolvency etc"" with these norms. 

 The new corporate governance norms for listed companies are coming into effect from October 1. However, Sebi recently relaxed some provisions after representations from the industry bodies and the government and it has given time till April 1, 2015 for a key provision of having minimum one woman director on the boards of listed companies. 

 A senior official said that the brokers have also already begun making representations before the regulator with concerns that any tightening of corporate governance norms could hurt their business due to high compliance costs. 

 The brokers are arguing that they are already operating in a highly regulated business and the new Companies Act has already provided for significant tightening of norms for the corporate brokerage firms. 

 Among others, the proposed norms would require brokers to submit their audited annual reports within 60 days of end of a financial year and a half-yearly networth certificate within two months of the end of a half-year to the stock exchange. 

 The quarterly financial results would be required to be submitted within 45 days of end of each quarter, while annual audit would need to be done by ""an independent, competent and qualified auditor"". 

 No stock broker would be allowed to re-appoint an individual as an auditor for more than one term for five consecutive years. In case of an audit firm, it can be appointed for maximum two terms of five consecutive terms. 

 In their periodic financial disclosures, the brokers would have to separately mention the advance or margins received from their clients, as also any advance or loans given by them. 

 Details of loans, advances or investments in subsidiaries, associates or group companies, as also all material information about their financial position, performance, governance and ownership, would need specific disclosures. 

 The brokers would also need to disclose all exceptional income and expenditure, along with auditors' observations, while their quarterly and annual financial results would need to be approved by the board of director and CEO/CFO along with a certification of ""absence of falsity or omission"". 

 The board of directors would need to lay down a code of conduct for all board members and senior management of the company, and also devise an effective whistle blower mechanism enabling all stakeholders, including employees, to freely communicate their concerns about any illegal or unethical practices. 

 The board would have to ensure that the interest of a whistle-blower is not prejudicially affected. 

 With regard to investor grievance, a compliance officer would need to ensure that they are redressed in a stipulated manner and within a given timeline. The status of all investor complaints would need to be reviewed and analysed every six months and corrective steps would be required to be taken by the compliance officer to ""minimise recurrence in future"". 

 The CEO of the company would need to certify that ""there are no transaction entered into by the stock broker during the year which are fraudulent, illegal or violating the stock broker's code of conduct"". 

 The certification would also include that the auditor has been informed about any significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting or in accounting policies, as also about the ""instances of significant fraud of which they have become aware and the involvement therein, if any, of the management or an employee"".

 Sebi had earlier ordered attachment of bank accounts and demat accounts of -- Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Prem M Parikh, Bharat S Thakkar, Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Hemant Kumar Motihar -- to recover the penalties imposed on them for violation of capital market norms. 

 In separate release orders issued this month, the market watchdog said it has recovered Rs 33.44 lakh from Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Rs 7.1 lakh from Prem M Parikh, Rs 6.46 lakh from Bharat S Thakkar, Rs 4.54 lakh from Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Rs 2.57 lakh from Hemant Kumar Motihar. 

 Together these dues amount to Rs 54.14 lakh. They include interest and other expenses along with the penalties. 

 Stating that it had collected ""full and final settlement of the dues"" from the defaulters, Sebi directed the banks and depositories - NSDL and CDSL - to defreeze the accounts of the entities. 

 ""...you are hereby directed to release the bank accounts/ lockers/demat accounts, of the defaulter attached, if any, pursuant to the notice of attachment,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in the release orders. 

 Till July-end, the market regulator was able to recover penalties worth nearly Rs 7 crore from several defaulters. 

 Sebi had began passing orders earlier this year to defreeze bank accounts and demat accounts of entities which made the payment of outstanding dues. 

 The capital markets watchdog began initiating attachment proceedings against defaulters, including individuals and companies, in October last as per the greater powers granted to it through an ordinance promulgated by the government. 

 Since then, the Sebi has launched nearly 1,400 attachment proceedings for recovery of penalties imposed in as many as 393 cases. These proceedings involve attachment of bank accounts, movable and immovable properties, shares and debentures, among others. 

 The market regulator is looking to recover penalties aggregating to nearly Rs 1,700 crore imposed on various entities.

 The proposed study will also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others. 

 The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by capital markets regulator Sebi for the next financial year beginning April 1, 2014, for which it has identified 'capacity building' as a core focus area, a senior official said. 

 According to the proposed move, a comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to understand the ""trend/pattern discovery by regulators in developed markets like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong"" in order to keep pace with the ever increasing globalisation of Indian markets. 

 ""The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc,"" the official added. 

 In 2014-15, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) also plans to organise an International Research Conference with an aim to commence a dialogue on ways to tackle newer challenges faced by securities markets by ameliorating the pool of research talent around the world. 

 Sebi, which was established on April 12, 1988, has also proposed to organise a Foundation Day lecture each year, beginning the next fiscal by inviting a Nobel laureate or an eminent person from the fields like economics and finance to talk on relevant issues for securities markets. 

 With regard to Sebi's capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously. 

 At present, Sebi's average training budget per person per year is the lowest among all its peer regulators, while the area of skill development also needs a further fillip. 

 While Sebi is already working on increasing its staff strength in a gradual manner from about 700 currently, it is looking to achieve quality enhancement of staff through better training and skill enhancement measures, so as to further bolster the supervisory and regulatory capacity of the organisation.

"Sebi, exchanges to tighten grip on speculative stocks",neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-exchanges-to-tighten-grip-on-speculative-stocks/articleshow/41135774.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi, exchanges to tighten grip on speculative stocks","MUMBAI: The capital market regulator and stock exchanges are planning to tighten their grip over small-cap and penny stocks that are susceptible to manipulation. The Securities and Exchange Board of India and the bourses may introduce a new segment called T+ Group, under which margin requirements would be steep and circuit filters would be lower.
 
 At present, stock exchanges try to prevent manipulation by transferring them to the trade-to-trade segment or T Group.. In this segment, traders have to take delivery of the shares they buy, while the daily maximum tradable limit is 5% on either side.
 
 Exchanges shift stocks to the T Group when there is speculation and unusual movement on the back of higher-than-average volumes. These requirements result in a fall in unnatural activity in such shares. The plan to introduce a new segment comes on the heels of reports of manipulation in stock prices during inclusion into or exclusion from the T Group.
 
 The T+ Group would include shares that have been in the T Group for over three months and whose price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is less than 250 and book value is less than 30 times, said a source familiar with the matter. “Exchanges have got complaints that there is still a lot of manipulation despite stocks being shifted to the T Group. So, they felt there is a need for a new group,” said a source in the know.
 
 Under the T+ Group, margin requirement of 500% and 100% will be introduced on sell and buy transactions respectively. Funds and shares wo
uld be released by the clearing corporation of the exchange only after a month, while the circuit filter would be even lesser than 5%. It has also been proposed that at the time of review, the companies having a P/E greater than 50 times or price-to-book greater than 10 times, will be eligible for moving out of T+ Group to T Group.
 
 Earlier this month, bourses moved almost 550 stocks out of the T Group after they were convinced that speculation has receded. The T Group was introduced shortly after the Ketan Parekh scam in 2001 but the detailed norms of how, when and why shares would be put under surveillance were not disclosed until November 2010.

  What are your views on SBI?
  
  There is nothing in the chart. Till it breaks 2400, I do not see a big move. I do not see that happening very soon but I do not see it cracking down, going below 2270-2280. So broadly 2270-2350, that is the range.
  
  
  What do you make out of generally in terms of the midcap side of the market?
  
  We have had decent moves in midcaps also, but I would agree that it has been very specific and selective. You did not have a whole host of midcaps moving, but even in the banking space, you have a State Bank which is sideways but you have a Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank which is ready to move 5-7% even from current levels. So it is more of choosing and picking of stocks. It is not this or that. Some of this, some of that is what I feel.

The Bank Nifty has broken down. SBI is a very important constituent of that index. A lot of other PSU banking stocks are showing weak patterns. If somebody was short at 1950 or 2000 strike call option, we will hardly have any premium left. So, it make sense to cover them up.  Plus 1650 broadly was a strike where some put writing was observed earlier but that has been covered up with the fact that stock prices are now trading below those levels. So, I would not remain long on SBI or any other banking stocks via the futures or the options route for the time being. Cover up all positions of SBI.

 LONDON: Come Monday, global equity markets will wake up to a new $558 billion magnet pulling cash out of developing nations from Russia to Malaysia. 

 As Saudi Arabia lifts a ban on direct investments by foreigners, fund allocators are preparing to shift money out of other countries and put it to work in the Arab world's largest stock market. While there's little consensus on which country will be the biggest loser, money managers mostly agree that energy producers will feel the heaviest effects. Below are the views of seven emerging-markets investors and strategists on what to expect: 

 Martial Godet, head of emergingmarket equities and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas SA in Paris: 

 Saudi Arabia “will not be a bargain, but it can be a nice diversification from emerging Asia that has become increasingly large within emerging markets. The biggest losers will be markets associated with oil and energy: Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia.“ 

 Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging-markets strategist at NN Investment Partners in The Hague: 

 “Investors will eventually sell a bit across the board to get to a decent weight in Saudi Arabia. There might be a bit more selling in other oil countries, but then we should ask ourselves what are the pure oil plays in emerging-markets, comparable to Saudi Arabia? Only Russia comes close.“ 

 Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital in London: 

 “The UAE and Qatar may suffer. After Saudi Arabia's inclusion in MSCI EM, investors might think: why bother looking at small Qatar when you can choose Saudi to be your Gulf proxy?“ 

 James Bannan, who oversees the $150 million Frontier Markets Fund at Coeli Asset Management in Mal mo, Sweden: 

 “Most of the large frontier-market funds already have decent exposure to Saudi Arabia. If they were to increase their exposure, it would come from allocations in the region, namely Kuwait, the UAE., Qatar and Oman.“ 

 Rami Sidani, the head of frontier markets at Schroder Investment Management in Dubai: 

 “The event of Saudi Arabia opening up is a very positive development for the entire Gulf region, as it graduates to becoming an investment destination for emerging-market funds. The Gulf market won't be able to be disregarded by international investors as an asset class.“ 

 Julian Mayo, co-chief investment officer at Charlemagne Capital in London: 

 “This move will gradually benefit Saudi in the next two years, as Saudi becomes investible to a wider range of investors, but we don't expect any specific market to suffer as a result of this move. Ultimately, stock performance depends on fundamentals of earnings and valuations.“ 

 Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, the head of the Europe, Middle East, Africa and global frontier markets equity team at Baring Investment Services in London: 

 “I don't think there is going to be a massive knock-on effect to start with from the day of the opening, as the market is being opened in a very limited way with a lot of requirements for anyone wanting to go into the market directly. We are already in Saudi Arabia. It's an out-ofindex position in my fund, which is around 20 %.""

  The company is an approved global vendor of General Electric (GE) and it has obtained an approval of Mazagaon Dock, a GoI enterprise manufacturing submarines and vessels for defence, and Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, he added.
  
  ""The company has secured term loan of Rs 50 crore and Rs 22 crore from the State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, respectively for the project, while Rs 36.90 crore shall be raised through this IPO to part finance the project,"" Sanghvi said.
  
  ""In a pre-IPO placement, the company has sold close to seven lakh equity shares at Rs 80 per piece to a German company Dango & Dinethal Mascinenbau (GMBH), with the lock in period of one year,"" he said.
  
  The company turnover stood at Rs 29.50 crore in the third quarter of 2010-11 ending December, of which 20 per cent accounts for exports. It reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 3 crore.

  ""Further, the company informs that Soiles Bhattacharya Director (Finance) SAIL has been given the additional charge of Chairman SAIL,"" it added.
  
  Bhattacharya is the senior most director in SAIL. Official sources said that he has been given the additional charge for a period of three months or until further orders are issued.
  
  The steel ministry had to appoint an interim chairman, as there were delays in approval of state-owned BHEL's C S Verma for the top job in the steel PSU. Government's headhunter Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Verma for the post of chairman of SAIL.
  
  While most of the clearances for Verma were in place, his appointment was not yet confirmed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), pending which Bhattacharya has been appointed as the interim chairman.
  
  A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said that recently certain clarifications were sought from the ACC over appointment of a new chairman of SAIL.
  
  ""The Steel Ministry has already sent its reply on Verma's appointment to the ACC,"" he added.
  
  Steel minister Virbhadra Singh had last month said that he has already approved Verma's name for the post of SAIL chairman and recommended the same to the ACC.
  
  Bhattacharya assumes the responsibility of the country's largest steel firm at a time, which analysts say could be ""a very difficult time for the steel industry"", which is hit by rising prices of raw material like iron ore and coking coal and slackening demand ahead of the monsoon.

The company had issued notices to these bankers alleging that advising Tata Steel, which was also from the same sector, amounted to conflict of interest. 
  
  “The issue with the bankers have been resolved and we will attempt to enter the market by the end of March, depending upon the market condition,” SAIL chairman CS Verma told ET.
  
  On Thursday, the department of disinvestments met senior officials of steel ministry, SAIL and representatives of six investment bankers to give the green signal for the FPO. “Bankers have done significant due diligence on the mandate. It will take two more weeks to prepare the prospectus that will be filed with the Sebi,” a banker told ET.
  
  The exact timing of the issue will depend upon the Rs. 12,000-crore share sale by exploration behemoth Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, a senior official of the department of disinvestments said. The proposed issue comprises 5% of fresh issue by the company and a share sale of a similar amount by the government.

Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-swings-hand-arbitrage-advantage-to-day-traders/articleshow/45635008.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,"MUMBAI: With the rupee turning volatile against the dollar, day traders have tapped an arbitrage opportunity within a short span between the exchange traded futures and domestic over-the-counter forward markets. 

 The intensity on Tuesday was about 5-10 paise compared with zero to three paise a week or two ago in the 1-month contract category. Traders were seen buying the January contract in the dollar-rupee pair at about 63.82/$ while selling the similar maturity forward contract at 63.87-63.88. The gap, or spread, was on the higher end in other pairs like euro-rupee or pound-rupee or yen-rupee. 

 “Traders have initiated fresh long positions for the last two weeks as the rupee has turned volatile,” said Sajal Gupta - head (forex and interest rate), Edelweiss Financial Services. 

 “Earlier, they were enjoying premium of a stable exchange rate. Intra-day sharp volatility led to some arbitrage opportunities.” The average daily futures volume has nearly doubled to 11,300 crore compared with 6,050 crore in the first fortnight of the month, show data from NSE. 

 Between December 15 and 23, the rupee has swung from 62.46 to 63.89 per dollar, a movement as high as 2.29%, or 143 paise. 

 “After being ranged and quiet for nearly five months, dollar/rupee sprang to life since the first week of December,” said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities. “Since then, turnover or participation has increased in all the three pillars of financial markets, viz., speculators, arbitrageurs and hedgers have become active.” 

 Over the past one week, the offshore non-deliverable forward market has been tepid as most traders have gone on leave ahead of year-end festivities globally. 

 The spreads, or gaps, with non-deliverable forward (NDF) from two domestic markets have shrunk to near zero from eight or 10 paise discount earlier. This, too, has fuelled arbitrages between domestic futures and forwards. Futures, forwards and NDFs all are the rupee derivatives. 

 Such large arbitrage opportunities have been lapped up by traders, which has helped in pumping up the volume on the exchange, dealers said. “We have seen arbitrage between futures and forward markets whenever there is demand-supply mismatch and sudden exchange rate volatility,” said Abhishek Goenka, founder & CEO, India Forex Advisors. 

 Arbitrage opportunities wane as and when the exchange rate turns to a particular trending, be it down or up instead of sharp swings. Traders’ rush to tap such opportunities is also being blamed. 

 “That too has not lasted long, as players have captured the difference and consequently, the contracts on OTC and exchange are now almost back at parity,” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, the local unit trended down against the greenback to close the day’s trading at 63.52 per dollar, weakened 0.38% from a day earlier. 

 Oil companies were seen buying dollars in the domestic forwards to meet their month-end demand.

RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group to begin new CSR initiatives,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/rp-sanjiv-goenka-group-to-begin-new-csr-initiatives/articleshow/31207287.cms,m.economictimes.com,RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group to begin new CSR initiatives,"KOLKATA: The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group will float a separate entity to take up CSR activities of the group. The entity could be a trust or a corporate entity as well, said Sanjiv Goenka, the group’s chairman. This trust will set up center for excellences in the areas of education, skills development and healthcare. Goenka was talking to reporters on the eve of 84th birthday of RP Goenka. 

 Goenka, who announced RP Goenka scholarship scheme on Friday, said the group has a net profit of around Rs 900 crore. As per the new rule 2 per cent of the net profit should go to CSR activities. ""Our target is to set up one world class institution in every three years,"" he added. RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group could have an yearly corpus of Rs 18 crore for CSR. ""We want to create institutions and do something which is worthwhile instead of fettering it away. We are in the process of creating a trust which will set up bodies like educational and medical institutions. The idea is to create at least one institution in a period of three years. So, within a timespan of a decade we will be able to set up at least three institutions something which the city would be proud of. The trust is not yet been formed, and we are looking at things like the corpus that we can start with. We need a centralised structure to channelise our CSR initiatives ,"" he said. 

 ""We need around Rs 50-55 crore for a world class education or healthcare institution. So in 10 years we can have three. It is better to do something tangible from the CSR fund,” he added. Elaborating about the scholarship, Goenka added that it will offer Rs 60,000 scholarship a year to 30 students in the state initially. More students will be added gradually. 

 ""A student who has secured at least minimum 85 per cent marks in 2014 class 12 examination will be eligible for the scholarship. The idea is to support the student till it finishes the bachelors’ degree,"" he added. However,the combined family income of the applicant should not exceed Rs 2.5 lakh per year.

AGM can open new chapter for RIL shareholders,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/agm-can-open-new-chapter-for-ril-shareholders/articleshow/6061579.cms,m.economictimes.com,AGM can open new chapter for RIL shareholders,"
  MUMBAI: When Mukesh Ambani steps out of his Black Mercedes, with wife Nita Ambani in tow, on Friday, to chair the annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries (RIL), it could mark the beginning of a new chapter not only for the Ambani family, but the extended family of 3.5 million RIL shareholders.
  
  Many thoughts would cross Mukesh's mind before he proceeds for the 36th AGM, being held at the Birla Matoshree auditorium in south Mumbai, as the company embarks on a new journey of going beyond its traditional business of oil refining to enter new sectors like power, telecom and financial services. These were the very sectors which RIL was barred from entering after the Reliance empire was split between the two brothers . Now, with the truce in place, the AGM would put an official seal on the patch-up , something which shareholders having been hoping to witness for a long time.
  
  What began as a bitter period of animosity between the Ambani brothers five years ago, could well come to an end on Friday, if Anil Ambani attends, something which no one is confirming but everyone is talking about. Anil is expected to represent himself as an ‘ordinary shareholder' , this time to express his gratitude for the truce agreement between RIL and his group.
  
  
  Shareholders expect big announcements
  
  The AGM of RIL would mark a breakaway from what shareholders saw at the August 2005 AGM, when an emotional Anil Ambani had said: ‘‘ Today, it is a very emotional day for me as I stand here with the blessings of my beloved mother Kokilaben . She has given birth to me twice. First, on June 4, 1959 and the second one on June 18, 2005. Both Mukesh and I could not be in front of you without her support and blessings.” Perhaps, June 18, 2010 would mark another rebirth for Anil.
  
  Ironically, he had sought his elder brother's blessings even then, when he was getting started on building his own empire. In all probability , this year's AGM could be like a ‘home coming' for Anil and his family, given the thaw in relations between the two factions.Shareholders could indeed witness a special ‘Kodak ’ moment if the two families happen to be seated together in the front row, just like old times.
  
  However, one sticky subject which Mukesh could touch upon at the AGM is the gas pricing issue for ADAG's power business. Mukesh had, in past AGMs, briefed shareholders on the gas dispute, which has been the main bone of contention between the two brothers ever since the Reliance empire was split. Said Shailesh Mehta, an RIL shareholder , who owns 32 shares of the company since it went public in 1977, ‘‘ I’m expecting the chairman to make big announcements at the AGM. We expect a new vision for RIL.”
  
  Clearly, the mood is already upbeat as to what Mukesh would unveil at the AGM.

Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/should-you-opt-for-richly-valued-stocks/articleshow/44867043.cms,m.economictimes.com,Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,"The holy grail of stock market investing has forever remained elusive: fundamentally sound companies trading at cheap valuations. Like all good things in life, the top performers of the equity universe—companies that boast stable cash flows, high profit margins and efficient management, among others—carry the burden of high valuations, with their shares trading at substantial premiums to the broader indices as well as their peers.

This presents a dilemma for investors and experts alike. Some people like Vikas Gupta, executive vice-president, Arthveda Fund Management, questions the obsession with 'quality'. ""People are paying through their nose for these stocks. There is no doubt about the solid fundamentals of these companies, but there is a limit to the premium one should be paying for them,"" he says. Gupta believes such valuations cannot be sustained for long. ""There are other companies that are valued at much lower prices, and when these sectors and companies start showing results, money will be pulled out from the highperforming set of stocks,"" he argues.

Therefore, Gupta cautions investors against blindly buying the so-called highquality stocks. ""Unless there is a strong likelihood of the company's sales doubling within the next 2-3 years, and this positive development has not been factored in in the pricing of the stock, paying such a high price for it just does not make sense,"" Gupta adds.

In spite of the warnings by experts, there is always a good reason to track these fundamentally strong companies that have been commanding rich valuations in the market across time periods because of the opportunities they might throw up. Here, we have restricted our search to the CNX100 universe and included only those high-performing stocks that have been around for the past 10 years (since October 2004). The stock-picking filters left us with 79 stocks. Next, we compared the monthly average price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for each of these stocks against the monthly average PE of the Nifty index for the period under consideration. This exercise revealed the number of occasions on which each stock traded at a premium to the benchmark index, helping us identify the final list of perennially expensive stocks.

We have also compared the 10-year median PE of these stocks with the current PE to check where they stand today in terms of historical valuations. To determine the median, we first sort the list in ascending order, then pick the middle value. Comparing it to the average or mean valuation, the median value is a much more realistic interpretation of the market, especially if the data distribution is asymmetrical, which is the case for many of the stocks under consideration. Let's dig deeper into the final list of eight high-performing stocks and assess where they stand in terms of their fundamentals.

Stocks that have consistently traded at premium valuations

				

Asian Paints

The market leader in the paints business has always commanded a hefty premium in the stock market. Its superior pricing power due to its leadership position has allowed the company to maintain healthy profit margins throughout the past decade.

Over the past 2-3 years, Asian Paints has clocked a steady volume growth of around 10 per cent. With the company's new premium offerings in the fast-growing exterior paints segment, it is likely to maintain its profitability. Currently, the stock is trading at around 50 times the trailing 12-month earnings, compared to the 10-year median PE of 31.5. It is available at 144 per cent premium to the Nifty index PE. With these high valuations, most analysts are emphasising on caution despite the company's superior fundamentals. Says Shirish Pardeshi, head, research, Anand Rathi Securities: ""Though the company continues to report a healthy earnings growth, we believe most of the upside is capped at current valuations.""


	 


Dabur

The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major, Dabur, enjoys a strong presence in the low-penetration and high-growth categories. It is known for its unique positioning, with a suite comprising products derived from ayurvedic and herbal sources. The company's robust fundamentals have naturally been awarded with premium valuations at all times. The stock has historically traded at a PE of around 37 times, but is currently enjoying a valuation multiple of nearly 57 times the trailing 12-month earnings. This stands at a 173 per cent premium to the Nifty index, almost twice its historical premium of 88 per cent. Despite these high valuations, analysts remain bullish on the stock given the company's strong innovation pipeline and high volume growth. Says Abneesh Roy, analyst at Edelweiss Securities: ""The company is in a sweet spot with volume growth ahead of most peers due to its huge innovation funnel, higher ad spends and aggressive distribution drive.""

HDFC

The first specialised housing finance company in the country, HDFC has enjoyed premium valuations over the years due to its consistent track record in earnings and loan book growth. Across economic cycles, its return ratios have remained healthy, with a return on equity of over 20 per cent in the past 10 years. The company's share price has appreciated recently due to the expectations of a merger with its subsidiary, HDFC Bank. Today, the stock trades at 29 times the earnings, which is not too far from its 10-year median PE of around 27. Its premium over the Nifty is at par with its historical valuation premium.

""At the operating level, HDFC continues to deliver superior performance led by strong growth, steady margins and robust asset quality. However, the stock is trading at a premium valuation and the scope for upside is limited,"" says a report from brokerage firm, Sharekhan. It maintains its 'hold' rating on the stock.

HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank has always held sway over the market, enjoying rich valuations. It has been awarded for its consistent track record of clocking over 30 per cent profit growth. However, it has recently seen the valuations fall from a historical context, after failing to match its own lofty standards of earnings growth. The valuation premium over the Nifty index has narrowed significantly compared to its historical premium. Analysts, however, remain positive on the stock. Says Vaibhav Agrawal, vicepresident, research, Angel Broking:

""Though the current earnings trajectory at over 21 per cent year-on-year is lower than its illustrious track record of over 30 per cent earnings growth, it is still impressive and better than other large private peers in light of the current macro environment. A likely economic recovery would reflect in higher loan growth, which, in our view, justifies a premium valuation multiple.""

Kotak Mahindra Bank

This relative newcomer in the banking space has made a mark for itself with its focus on retail loans. It fetches the highest net interest margins in the industry at 4.5 per cent and boasts a better-than-average asset quality, with its net non-performing assets (NPA) of 1 per cent. It grew its loan book at 25 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past five years. Its high loan book growth, strong management and consistently high return ratios have allowed it to enjoy rich valuations.

At 51 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is trading marginally higher than its his torical multiple and is expensive. Analysts, however, remain bullish because of its all-round superiority. Says Manish Ostwal, analyst, KR Choksey Institutional Research: ""We believe that strong core capitalisation, superior margins and asset quality, improving liability franchise with strong market positioning in capitallinked businesses, are the key differentiators for Kotak.""


	 


Titan Company

Jewellery and watchmaker, Titan, is another company that has always been valued on the higher side. Its dominant position in the organised market, aided by unwavering trust from an upwardly mobile and increasingly brand-conscious Indian middle class, has held the company in good stead all these years. The stock has historically traded at twice the valuation of the broader Nifty index, but is currently trading at a premium of 135 per cent. At a PE of 49 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is much more expensive than its 10-year median PE of around 39. Yet, analysts are convinced that the stock has enough potential even at these levels. Says Gautam Duggad, analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities: ""We believe that Titan will be a key beneficiary of the improving macro and urban consumer sentiment. The dominant presence in its core segments, underlying shift towards branded segments in both jewellery and watches, and a strong balance sheet make it a compelling play on rising urban aspirations and, therefore, a preference for branded lifestyle goods.""

Apollo Hospitals 

Apollo is India's largest private healthcare service provider, with an integrated business model that offers an umbrella of services. Apart from hospitals, the company has the largest organised pharmacy retail chain, with around 1,600 stores, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of its total revenue. The healthcare services segment has grown at a healthy CAGR of 17 per cent over the past five years on account of incremental hospital addition, as well as expansion and maturity of older hospitals. The pharmacy business has grown at nearly 33 per cent CAGR in the past five years and is also a candidate for possible value unlocking in the future. The consistent growth has allowed the company to fetch premium valuations at all times. At a trailing PE of 46 times, the stock is trading much higher than its historical valuation of around 34.5 times. Analysts say the stock is not providing much comfort at these levels.

Motherson Sumi Systems

This auto component maker has been on an unmatched growth trajectory over the past decade. Even during the troubled years, when its peers struggled, Motherson was able to protect its revenue base and maintain profitability. In the past, it has set very ambitious five-year growth targets for itself and has gone ahead to achieve them.

Having already achieved its revenue target one year in advance, it appears set to meet its target of 40 per cent return on capital employed (ROCE) by 2015. Given such robust fundamentals, analysts continue to back the stock despite a steep PE multiple of 62 times. Says Kaushal Maroo, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services: ""Over the past five years, the Street's focus on nearterm earnings has possibly lead to it missing the bigger picture. The company has emerged from being an Indian wiring harness maker of repute to being a supplier of rear-view mirrors and polymer products to major European original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We see over 30 per cent earnings CAGR during 2013-18.""
The Nifty Fifty era

The craze over high-quality growth stocks has echoes of a bygone era—the US of the 1960s and 70s—when the Nifty Fifty, a basket of 50 popular stocks, enjoyed an obsessive following by investors. These were widely perceived as solid buy-and-hold growth stocks and their lofty valuations were considered well-justified. While these 50 stocks propelled the US bull market of the early 1970s, the subsequent bear market that lasted till 1982 caused valuations of the Nifty Fifty to fall to low levels along with the rest of the market. Most of these stocks underperformed the broader market averages. While many of these are still good performers (Coca-Cola, Gillette, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble), some have lost their way (Polaroid, Eastman Kodak, Dow Chemical). It should serve as a cautionary tale of unrealistic expectations from growth stocks.

Religare's top four picks for 2014,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/religares-top-four-picks-for-2014/articleshow/28235604.cms,m.economictimes.com,Religare's top four picks for 2014,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities have seen a liquidity-driven rally in 2013, with the Sensex adding 9%, or 1,700 points, and Nifty nearly 7%, or 400 points.
 
 FII inflows were strong during the year and they pumped in more than Rs 1.13 lakh crore into Indian equities.
 
 Elections are the major trigger for 2014 and investors expect that the new government would take strong decisions for the growth, Religare Retail Research said in a note.
 
 The important factors that may affect the stock market in the year 2014 are global and domestic market environment, inflation, interest rate scenario, fiscal/trade scenario in India and policy actions from the next government, among other things, added the report.
 
 Religare is of the view that volatility may continue as the US Fed decision for QE will play a major role. However, the volatility should be used to pick strong fundamental stocks for long term.
 
 The brokerage firm selected following four stocks for the year 2014. It believes the strong growth potential and robust business model of these companies could be rewarding for investors.
 
 
1) Britannia Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1,050
 
 The company expects sustained growth in both bakery and dairy segments in FY14-15. Its growth is expected to be driven via heavy investment in advertising and promotions as well as infrastructure investments, both in the premium and discount segments.
 
 The company expects that it would continue to drive profitable growth in an extremely competitive environment with focus on consumers, customers and cost-effectiveness.
 
 
2) Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd: Target price set at Rs 610
 
 The product pipelines of the company for FY14 are strong and resilient. This fiscal year could witness some more positive action during the second and third quarters as the outlicensing deal with Sanofi could show pleasant progress.
 
 The company has also received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to launch Crofelemer, a drug used for HIV-linked diarrhea. The company is currently preparing to file for approvals to launch this medication in 140 countries.
 
 
3) Jyothi Laboratories Ltd: Target price set at Rs 225
 
 The company has revitalized its flagship brand and also rejigged its detergents portfolio acquired from Henkel. It is likely to launch new products in the personal care space.
 
 To increase awareness of its brands, the company has identified seven power brands that'll be marketed aggressively. Now the company aims to increase its turnover three-fold to Rs 3,000 crore in the next three years.
 
 
4) Rallis India Ltd: Target price set at Rs 210
 
 The company believes that there is a big opportunity in the Indian agrochemical industry as the usage of pesticides in India is one of the lowest in the world with 0.48 kg/ha whereas average world consumption is around 3-5 kg/ha and only 35-40% of the farmland is under crop protection.
 
 The company is strengthening its organic portfolio and focusing on agrochemicals that account for about 85% of its business. It plans to increase its presence in the seeds business and focus on exports.

Reckitt Benckiser names Nitish Kapoor as India MD,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/reckitt-benckiser-elevates-india-md-nitish-kapoor-to-global-leadership-role/articleshow/61565898.cms,m.economictimes.com,Reckitt Benckiser elevates India MD Nitish Kapoor to global leadership role,"British consumer goods and healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser has elevated its India managing director Nitish Kapoor into a global leadership role, as part of a sweeping restructuring of operations globally.
 
 Kapoor, who led the India operations for four years and was also RB’s senior vice-president for South Asia, will now head the company’s health business in North America. He will move to the US and report to global chief executive Rakesh Kapoor.
 
 The new structure will be implemented starting the first quarter of 2018.
 
 Under Kapoor, RB India had posted sales of Rs 5,606 crore in fiscal 2016, an expansion of 14% over the previous financial year. Growth was fuelled by improved higher direct distribution in rural markets, introduction of packs at entry-level price points in brands such as Dettol and Harpic, and the ‘Banega Swachh’ campaign to leverage the sanitation brands.
 
 An RB India spokesperson confirmed the development. “RB has reorganised its business, globally, into two units: RB Health and RB Hygiene Home. Nitish Kapoor, currently senior VP South Asia, is moving as executive vice president, RB Health, North America, based in the US.”
 
 RB India will also have two heads — one each for health and hygiene businesses — instead of one overall chief executive.
 
 Gaurav Jain is being appointed as senior vice president Africa, the Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) for RB Health. He will also take charge of the India health business. Narasimhan Eswar is being appointed as senior vice president, South Asia-RB Home Hygiene, and will be looking after the India hygiene home business.
 
 Both executives are internal recruits.
 
 The maker of Dettol soap, Air Wick air freshener and Veet hair remover announced its decision to split its businesses globally last year to sharpen its focus and fuel growth in a challenging market. RB Health is a 7.5 billion pound business.
 
 “RB is embracing bold changes when needed, to continue to create disproportionate shareholder value. The new structure also reinforces the prowess that RB has when it comes to growing diverse talent and building a culture of merit and performance,” said Vibhav Dhawan, managing partner of executive search and consulting firm Positive Moves Consulting.
 
 US baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition, which Reckitt Benckiser acquired for £14.2-billion in June this year, will be part of RB Health. RB Hygiene Home will have brands such as Lysol, Vanish, Finish and Air Wick, and is a five billion pounds business.
 
 In its latest reported earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, RB had reduced its full-year sales outlook, with its net revenue falling 1% to £3.2 billion. The company said it is expecting sales to be flat in the full year, down from a previous target of 2%. RB has struggled with weak sales in recent months, owing to a subdued consumption environment and the Petya ransomware attack earlier this year. The cyber attack had severely impacted the company's ability to make and export products to some markets.

RBI Deputy Governor Anand Sinha retires,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/rbi-deputy-governor-anand-sinha-retires/articleshow/29122013.cms,m.economictimes.com,RBI Deputy Governor Anand Sinha retires,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Anand Sinha, who was looking after the new bank licence process has retired, even as procedure of granting licences to the private sector is yet to be completed. 

 His portfolio has been allocated to other three Deputy Governors. 

 It is also believed that Sinha will be appointed as an adviser to the central bank for a period of three months so that his expertise can be utilised for shortlisting of applicants for bank licences. 

 Initially, 26 entities evinced interest in entering the banking arena. Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, withdrew its application in November, leaving 25 players in the fray. 

 Public sector units India Post and IFCI, private sector Anil Ambani group and Aditya Birla group submitted applications on July 1. Besides, Bajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Religare Enterprises and Shriram Capital have applied for licences. 

 The Finance Minister and RBI Governor at several occasions had said that bank licences to corporates would be granted by the end of current fiscal. 

 ""I hope to announce the licences within, or soon after, the term of Deputy Governor Anand Sinha who has been shepherding the process. His term expires January 2014,"" RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had said in his first media briefing after taking charge from D Subbarao. 

 RBI in a statement said the portfolios are allocated among three other Deputy Governors-- K C Chakrabarty, H R Khan and Urjit Patel. 

 ""The RBI has reallocated the portfolios among the three Deputy Governors from Monday, January 20, 2014. The reallocation was necessitated consequent upon Anand Sinha relinquishing his charge as Deputy Governor,"" RBI said in a release. 

 Sinha was reappointed as the Deputy Governor of RBI for 11 months till January 18, 2014 in February last year. 

 He looked after the Department of Banking Operations and Development, the Department of Non-Banking Supervision and the Urban Banks Department, Departments of Risk Monitoring, Information Technology, Expenditure and Budgetary Control, Legal and Premises. 

 K C Chakrabarty has been given additional portfolio of Legal and Premises Department, Urban Banks Department. 

 H R Khan will get additional charge of Department of Banking Operations and Development, Department of Non-Banking Supervision and Urban Banks Department and Department of Information Technology. 

 While Urjit Patel gets the Department of Expenditure & Budgetary Control and Risk Monitoring as additional portfolios. 

 RBI said that the portfolio will be reallocated upon appointment of a new Deputy Governor.

RBI bets on 'shut period' to improve liquidity,neutral,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/rbi-says-liquidity-rebalancing-evolved-satisfactorily-holds-repo-auction-amid-gst-outflow/articleshow/89019436.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,RBI says liquidity rebalancing evolved satisfactorily; holds repo auction amid GST outflow,"NEW DELHI – The Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to rebalance the quantum of surplus liquidity in the banking system by shifting the excess funds from the overnight fixed-rate reverse window to variable rate reverse repo facilities has evolved satisfactorily, the central bank said on Thursday.

“As stated in Governor’s statement of December 8, 2021, the Reserve Bank has been rebalancing the surplus liquidity in the system by shifting it out of the fixed-rate overnight reverse repo window into the variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions of longer maturity. Overall, this rebalancing has proceeded on a pre-announced glide path and has evolved satisfactorily,” the RBI said through a press release on its website.

The central bank said that it would carry on rebalancing liquidity conditions in a non-disruptive manner while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the productive sectors of the economy. ""With larger than anticipated collections under the goods and services tax (GST), system liquidity has tightened in this week,"" it said.

After a long hiatus, the RBI announced and conducted a variable rate repo auction as overnight money market rates had hardened this week due to larger-than-anticipated collections under the goods and services tax.

The overnight variable rate repo auction, which had a notified amount of Rs 50,000 crore, drew bids worth Rs 65,700 crore, with the cutoff rate being set at 4.06 per cent. The weighted average rate was 4.10 per cent.

In a repo operation, the central bank lends out funds to banks in exchange for government securities.

In the December monetary policy review, the central bank had said that it aims to make the 14-day variable rate reverse repo auction, the primary route for liquidity absorption.

Following large-scale liquidity infusions by the central bank amid the coronavirus pandemic, liquidity in the banking system has swollen to record highs, with the surplus estimated at around Rs 7 lakh crores last week.

The central bank’s efforts to nudge banks to park funds at longer-tenure variable rate reverse repo auctions have not always met with success though, with some such auctions seeing poor participation as banks were averse to lending out cash for longer periods.

Some market participants have also questioned the efficacy of the step, given that a significant portion of the liquidity surplus rests on the books of mutual funds, which are not permitted access to the RBI’s reverse repo window.

Managing liquidity conditions in the banking system is a tricky job for the RBI at the moment as inflation in India remains well above the central bank’s own targets, while central banks in advanced economies are progressively moving towards tighter monetary policies.

Even as economic growth still requires much support amid the COVID pandemic, it seems a foregone conclusion that the RBI will have to proactively tackle the liquidity surplus in the banking system and consider raising interest rates to be in sync with both global and domestic inflationary developments.

Raw material bull market fades as supply expands,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/raw-material-bull-market-fades-as-supply-expands/articleshow/19353111.cms,m.economictimes.com,Raw material bull market fades as supply expands,"LONDON: At a time when US equities are trading near a record and the dollar is having its best start in three years, commodities will finish this quarter little changed from where they were at the end of 2012. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials will be at 644 at the end of June, 1.2% lower than now, according to the median of nine investor and analyst predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The index rose 0.8% this year, the worst start since 2003. 

 Arabica coffee, silver and nickel will gain as cotton, crude and natural gas fall, analyst forecasts show. Investors had $132 billion tracking commodity indexes in February, Barclays estimates. Supplies of everything from copper to sugar to oil are now catching up with or exceeding demand after the S&P GSCI's almost fourfold advance since the end of 2001 spurred new mines, wells and crop acreage. 

 While the International Monetary Fund expects global economic growth to accelerate to 3.5% this year, from 3.2% in 2012, the Washington-based group cut its estimate three times since July. The 17-nation euro area already tumbled back into its second recession in three years. 

 ""No one is really concerned we're going to have any shortages,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, the Toronto-based company ranked by Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster on Brent oil and third-best in industrial metals over the past two years. 

 ""The big complaint is the inventories are probably a bit too high. It's difficult for us, given the supply configurations across the commodity spectrum, to say that we're going to see a lot of upside."" 

 The S&P GSCI beat the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities, the US Dollar Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index of bonds in six of the past 11 years. Commodities entered a bull market in August as the worst US drought since the 1930s drove crop prices to records and oil rallied. The gauge retreated about 4% since then and ended 2012 at 646.58. 

 Nine of the 24 items in the S&P GSCI are in bear markets, having declined at least 20% from their recent highs. They account for less than 17% of the index weightings, with New York oil, gasoil and heating oil still in bull markets. Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks fell 24% to $6 billion last year, the first drop since at least 2008, according to Coalition, an analytics company. Goldman Sachs ranked first in 2012, followed by JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, the London-based group estimates. 

 Smaller price swings may be curbing profit. The 100-day measure of volatility in the S&P GSCI dropped to 11.5 on March 18, the lowest since 1996, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The commodities supercycle, or longer-than-average period of rising prices, is over, Citigroup said in a November report. 

 China, the biggest user of everything from copper to cotton to coal, is slowing and years of higher prices encouraged more supply, the bank said. The retreat in raw materials in February reinforced that view, Ed Morse, the global head of commodities research in New York, said in an e-mail March 25.

Ranbaxy for short term: Deepak Mohoni,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/ranbaxy-for-short-term-deepak-mohoni/articleshow/8601029.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ranbaxy for short term: Deepak Mohoni,"
  Deepak Mohoni, Director, trendwatchindia.com, in a chat with ET Now, gives his call on Ranbaxy
  
  
  
  What do you think about Ranbaxy?
  
  Ranbaxy is pretty much a day trading and a short term buying idea. Not all pharmas are defensive, Ranbaxy is not a defensive pharma but every now and then it will make a pretty good move and it is doing exactly that. Short side, this is there only if the market starts going down. There is no point shorting in a rising market but we often have this 11 o’clock or a little bit later a reversal in the market. If that comes today, then a good short sale for intraday traders would be OnMobile Global, that is not doing much yet today and it has done pretty poorly in the last few weeks.

  Vinith Jain, Director, Siddh Capital in an interview with ET Now talks about Ramsarup.
  
  
  What’s your call on the steel companies? How do you view Ramsarup?
  
  The BSE metal index has been a poor performer in the recent past. The index faces a strong resistance around 15700 and even in the last three weeks, we see that the index has turned from 15250 around, so a pullback rally could maximum do up to 15500 or 15700. 
  
  On Ramsarup, I see the stock has been trending between 70 and 90 for quite sometime now and the upside is capped at 90, so unless it breaks above that, very little to take on the stock.

 ""We are also evaluating how to make entry into the export markets,"" said KR Venkatadri, chief operating officer, Rallis India. The company had launched its branded grapes towards the end of the season last year. Tata group follows corporates like Mahindra ShubhLabh and Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals, which have already entered the rapidly-growing segment of branded fruits. 

 Vekatadri was speaking after the launch of AMPLUS and AMPLUS Active, a microbial bio-product, which helps enhance the soil fertility. The products are from Norway-headquartered Agrinos, which has partnered with Rallis for marketing them in India. 

 DR Wagner, chief executive officer of Agrinos AS, said: ""About 30% of the world soils are degraded. When we launched this product in Texas in 2013 on 0.5% of the sugarcane crop, its usage increased to 10% of the total area under sugarcane the next year."" Agrinos was working with Rallis for the last two years to develop and test the product for Indian conditions.

Stay with quality stocks: Deven Choksey,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/be-realistic-sit-on-cash-and-accumulate-good-quality-stocks-deven-choksey/articleshow/69938554.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Be realistic, sit on cash and accumulate good quality stocks: Deven Choksey","Some of the midcap and largecap stocks are becoming attractive now and one will have to start looking at them with an investment horizon of one year and above, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Is it time to put money to work or is this the time where you need to clean up whatever you can get?The obvious view point here is that you sit tight in a situation like this and stay with good quality stocks in your portfolio. Some of the good quality stocks have also fallen and it is going to test your patience. We are observing that the market takes time to reward good quality stocks but they keep getting rewarded in subsequent period of time also. 
 
Today there is a situation of fear in the marketplace. People are unsure about where exactly some of the banks or the NBFC problem could hurt or hit some genuine companies in respective space. That is where we are telling people to stay with good quality promoters and the companies. Some of the stocks in the midcap and even in the largecap space are becoming attractive now and one should start looking at them with an investment horizon of one year and above. 
 
This fear factor will recede at some point of time and that is where we will find value in some of the good quality investment stocks which can reward you eventually. It is time to remain a little bit cautious. That does not mean one should be a pessimist. This country and economy offer huge opportunities. So do not be pessimistic. One should be realistic and sit on cash for some time and accumulate good quality stocks.


Will you be a buyer in Emami because the supply promoter overhang is clearly over?One sensible thing which is happening is the promoter group is basically paying off their debt and whichever way they are paying off, it is a good thing to observe. The second most important thing and that is where I would like to see the direction coming from Indian promoters. They are probably spread too thin in too many areas of business. At a promoter level, you should have a journey in some select areas and try and make the size as your destination. 
 
Many of the promoters have spread into too many businesses and that is going to be a problem area for them. The sooner those promoter groups consolidate and stay focussed, where they can register their mark by becoming a right size company I guess would be the one thing to look at. 
 
As of now, we do not get that kind of a signal from any of the promoter groups including Emami and that is where discomfort would be since they are spread too thin, It is not the time to look at them even though they may be correcting their past and bringing capital back to give shareholders relative comfort. I would like to see a clear focus on a select group of businesses and not too many areas. 
 

Earnings are not there generally and good quality stocks are super expensive. The slowdown in the consumer space is a reality and the delayed monsoon could create further stress on the agrarian economy. It clearly appears that for next 6, 8, 10 months, this market is gone.There are concerns over some of the factors which you have mentioned. Monsoon is definitely a concern. In next two-three months, we hope to get good rains and that is how we would probably remain relatively more confident going forward. 
 
As far as the consumption space is concerned, the solution lies in bringing down the rate of interest. Today for a variety of reasons, the banks and institutions have not been able to bring down the rate of interest. May be the argument going forward would be that can the country bring differential rate of interest wherein on one side you have the infrastructure projects which needs investment but which are not investing because of the high cost of funds. On the other side, the consumer wants to spend again and needs to know where to put his money at a lower cost of funds. This is a situation where a differential rate of interest could help relatively better investment on the consumption side as well as on the infrastructure spending side. 
 
What is common for both the sectors is that if an increase in spending takes place, then that may lead to revival in the economy or growth in corporate sector earnings. So, one is going to influence the other. Lower cost of interest will influence the higher rate of growth and that is where one would like to argue for bringing down the rate of interest. How soon, how fast will depend on the actions from the government side.

Puravankara Projects gives 70% dividend to non-promoters,neutral,https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/puravankara-projects-gives-70-dividend-to-non-promoters/articleshow/19605259.cms,m.economictimes.com,Puravankara Projects gives 70% dividend to non-promoters,"MUMBAI: Bangalore-based real estate developer Puravankara Projects is wooing shareholders with a handsome 70% dividend ahead of its share sale through an institutional placement programme (IPP) next month. Purvankara will spend close to Rs 75 crore dolling out dividend to its shareholders, while the promoters will take home only Rs 19.19 crore as 20% dividend. 

 The public shareholding in Purvankara is 9.04% while the promoters hold 89.96%, which they have to cut to 75% to satisfy Sebi's minimum public share holding norms. Investment banker JP Morgan has the mandate and Purvankara will sell shares through an IPP for around Rs 110 apiece, said a source involved with the deal. Puravankara has a m-cap of Rs 2,245 crore based on Wednesday's closing price on BSE. 

 Each Puravankara share has a face value of Rs 5 and public shareholders will get a dividend of Rs 3.5 per share. This makes it a dividend yield of 3.5% for shareholders of Puravankara based on closing the closing share price of Tuesday. The share price rose by 7% to close at Rs 105.2 on Wednesday after it declared the dividend. 

 Among real estate companies with a market-cap more than Rs 100 crore, only Kolte Patil Developers, at 4.11%, based on its last declared dividend, has a dividend yield higher than Puravankara. 

 ""The move raises the bar for corporate governance at a time minority shareholders feel short-changed every now and then. Real estate companies like DLF, Unitech and HDIL are unable to service their debt. Any such gesture by a company gives a good signal to the market,"" said an analyst of a Mumbai-based brokerage. 

 ""Giving a higher dividend to non-promoters is good for existing shareholders of the company but prospective shareholders should also look at various other parameters before investing,"" said Phani Shekhar, fund manager at Angel Broking. He said Purvankara's project execution was better than many of its peers and even its debt pile was less than peers like DLF and HDIL, among others.

  In terms of stock if you look at power as a sector, we are neutral, and our top pick is NTPC with a target price of Rs 202. We had a sell call on Neyveli Lignite earlier, and the stock has corrected and roundabout Rs 100 levels, it becomes a hold. The best part is that the company has all fully depreciated plants but then again going forward, the growth visibility is still lacking because the capex is still not happening as it should have been because of which we had a sell rating. Probably we will look at this stock afresh post this announcement but I do not think we are very bullish on the power sector as a whole for the next 12 months. We prefer NTPC because it has got a little far lesser fuel risk compared to some of the other players, which are banking on merchant or the regulated ones also.
