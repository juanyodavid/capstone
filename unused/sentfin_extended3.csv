Mid caps now turn into market darlings,"{""Mid caps"": ""positive""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/tide-turns-as-midcaps-become-brokerages-darling-again/articleshow/68350992.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Tide turns as midcaps become brokerages' darling, again","Mid- and small-cap shares are back on brokerages’ radar after remaining out of favour for over a year. A key reason behind it is that the current government's chances to come back to power after elections have improved following India’s military standoff with Pakistan. That is why the broader market has seen buying. As a result, midcaps have rebounded strongly. 

The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices have gained 4.4 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in the past two weeks, compared to the Sensex which is up 2.2 per cent during the same period. In 2018, BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices had fallen 13.4 per cent and 23.7 per cent, respectively. Also, there were macro headwinds and concerns about corporate governance and liquidity issues and there was lack of pick-up in earnings growth. Analysts believe the tide seems to be turning in favour of the broader market again. 

“Typically, the spread between large-cap and mid-cap returns has peaked out at 15-20 per cent. Post hitting this peak range, the performance has reversed in the past. Currently, this spread stands at 18 per cent,” said Motilal Oswal in a note. ET takes a look at midcap picks of top brokerages and their outlook going forward.


CLSA



SADBHAV ENGINEERING
CMP: Rs 223.35
Change in last one year : -41.8 per cent

Despite the recent 44 per cent rally since its low, Sadbhav Engineering’s stock trades at 7 times FY20 adjusted earnings and its valuation appears attractive, said foreign brokerage CLSA. The brokerage has added the midcap stock to its portfolio.


SOBHA
CMP: Rs 438.7
Change in last one year : -20 per cent

Sobha is another midcap in CLSA’s model portfolio. The foreign brokerage said the launch of Sobha’s second affordable project should help drive sales in the near term. “Sobha’s timely new launches amidst tough liquidity conditions for developers should help it gain market share significantly. ” said CLSA in a recent report, while retaining buy rating with a target price of Rs 628.


GODREJ PROPERTIES
CMP: Rs 699.55
Change in last one year : -6.7 per cent

Godrej Properties delivered good operating performance in the third quarter and this performance comes amidst tight liquidity for the sector, demonstrating Godrej’s strength and ability to gain from the ongoing sector consolidation, said CLSA. Access to cheap liquidity, a good delivery trackrecord and its timely expansion make Godrej well poised to gain market share, said CLSA.


MOTILAL OSWAL


INDRAPRASTHA GAS
CMP: Rs 293.35
Change in last one year : -5.5 per cent

Indraprastha Gas is one of Motilal Oswal’s preferred midcap ideas. The brokerage said in a recent report that Indraprastha Gas’ consistent operational outperformance, the government’s thrust on gas usage, and sustainable high-growth market warrant premium valuations. The recent Supreme Court ruling for Indraprastha to take over the assets of Haryana City Gas Distribution is another positive from the short- to medium-term volume growth perspective, said Motilal Oswal.


FEDERAL BANK
CMP: Rs 87.65
Change in last one year : -5.8 per cent

Federal Bank has maintained strong business momentum and it is reporting a gradual improvement in operating earnings. Strong capitalization levels and a robust liability franchise will enable market share gains in both corporate and retail segments, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 115.


SUN TV NETWORK
CMP: Rs 596.35
Change in last one year : -33.4 per cent

Motilal Oswal expects 12 per cent compounded growth in advertisement revenue over FY19 -FY21 on the back of new launches and increasing share of commission model-based shows. This, coupled with a foray in the Bangla genre, augurs well for the company, said Motilal Oswal in a recent report on Sun TV. Burgeoning IPL revenue is also expected to provide a fillip to overall revenue, it added.


CITIGROUP
SRF
CMP: Rs 2,351.85
Change in last one year : 27.3 per cent

SRF is among Citi’s top midcap ideas. SRF’s unique fluorine chemistry skills, history of innovation and operational management track-record, along with its proven ability to extract profits from even commoditized businesses, provide a long growth runway, said Citi.


SHRIRAM TRANSPORT FINANCE CO.
CMP: Rs 1,220.30
Change in last one year : -8.1 per cent

Shriram Transport’s niche focus on used vehicle segment and diversified borrowing profile positions it better to navigate through the liquidity challenges and tide over the cyclical nature of vehicle industry, said Citi. Whole the gross nonperforming asset ratio remains elevated at around 9 per cent, higher provision coverage ratio alleviates any major asset quality concern, it added. The stock trades at 1.7 times adjusted price-to-book on March 2020 estimates versus long term average of 2.1 times, said Citi.


EMAMI
CMP: Rs 383.1
Change in last one year : -29.3 per cent

Emami has underperformed the sector given its weak performance in multiple quarters. However, revenue trends are improving and three of its four segments are recovering as well, said Citigroup Global Markets. Valuations at 29 times FY20 adjusted EPS is well below sector peers and group leverage has reduced after promoters divested 10 per cent stake in the company, added Citi.

Infosys: Will the strong volume growth sustain?,"{""Infosys"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-will-the-strong-volume-growth-sustain/articleshow/21033072.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys: Will the strong volume growth sustain?,"MUMBAI: A stronger business volume growth and sustained momentum in new client accounts are brighter spots in the performance of Infosys in the first quarter of FY14. However, the management's stance to keep dollar denominated revenue guidance unchanged at 6-10% growth for the fiscal reflects that caution is still the buzzword. 

 Infosys, the second largest among the IT exporters that are listed on Indian bourses, reported 7.8% sequential growth in revenue at Rs 11,267 crore for the June 2013 quarter, surpassing the analysts' average estimate of 5.5% growth. The ET Intelligence Group (ETIG) had predicted 6.7% sequential increase in revenue. 

 Operating profit or earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) however lagged the ETIG's estimation of Rs 2,778.4 crore. The company reported Rs 2,664 crore in EBIT, a sequential growth of 8.2%. 

 The company was able to retain the operating margin calculated as the proportion of EBIT in the revenue at 23.6% compared with the previous quarter. For the September 2013 quarter, however, its CFO Rajiv Bansal has cited a negative impact of around 300 basis points on profitability due to the salary hikes of average 8% initiated at the beginning of July. 

 The stock market has reacted positively to the results. At Rs 2,810, the stock has gained over 11% in the morning session on Friday. The big jump can be attributed to a sharp increase in the rupee denominated revenue guidance by the company to 13-17% for the fiscal from the earlier forecast of 6-10% growth. 

 The company has been finding it difficult to report meaningful growth since the past few years. Against the backdrop, what could offer some relief to investors is the fact that it reported a strong 4.1% volume growth for the quarter, which is the largest since the September 2011 quarter when it had reported 4.5% jump. In addition, it continued to show momentum in new clients. It added 66 clients during the June 2013 quarter. 

 But, any major increase in the stock valuation from the current levels looks limited. This is because the company still faces pressure on its growth and margin, which is reflected from its stance of not revising the dollar denominated revenue guidance of 6-10% growth for the fiscal. 

 Also, it will be challenging to retain the strong volume growth amidst clouded outlook for IT demand. The management has iterated about the slowing offtake in the high-end, high-margin, discretionary projects. A rerating of the stock would require the company to show a sustained growth scenario in the coming quarters.

 Nasdaq listed EXL however reduced its yearly sales guidance due to rupee depreciation. EXL Service now expects revenues of $438 million to $442 million in 2012, $3 million less than its earlier outlook.
 
 “About 25% of our revenues are either denominated in Indian Rupees or have a pricing linked to devaluation of the Indian currency, which has led to the reduction in revenue outlook,” said Rohit Kapoor, EXL Service CEO and Vice Chairman.
 
 Profits for the firm in Q2 beat estimates. EXL’s net profit grew to $9.1 million in Q2 compared to $8.5 million in the same period last year. Nasdaq listed EXL Service shares were up 2.3% in opening trade to $25 a piece due to the buoyant results.
 
 The company attributed growth to the strong demand for decision analytics services, particularly in the insurance and banking verticals.
 
 The company counts American Express and British Gas as its large customers. The BPO won nine new clients during the quarter.Kapoor said that he sees better business coming in next few quarters as the currency devaluation makes it cheaper for clients to outsource.
 
 During the quarter, EXL’s margins expanded year-over-year and sequentially, driven by foreign exchange as well as growth in its transformation business. The margin expansion more than offset the headwinds from wage increases implemented during the quarter.
 
 EXL’s operating profit margins grew to 13.3% compared to 11.1% for the same quarter in 2011.

ET Now: On Bharti you have seen this risk on risk off trade in Bharti. Bulls are of the view that pricing power is coming back for telecom companies so Bharti is a buy but the bears are insisting that there is no pricing power, balance sheet has got diluted and Africa is still is in a mess?
 
 
Vinay Khattar: Precisely for the same reason, my personal view is not very strong on either side. We were pretty early movers in terms of pricing power getting diluted quite a few years ago and we believe that the stocks would be in pain. Over the last one or two years you have seen certain degree of consolidation happening and beginning to happen and you are seeing certain elements of pricing power especially on the domestic side coming back. But is it early days on that my personal sense is yes you were want to wait a while and see how the trend actually plays out in terms of pricing power and we must not forget that the electronic space, the entire segment of more computerisation, more electronic space is pretty commoditise at this particular point in time and with new players like Reliance Geo entering the space you do not know how the even the data part is going to play out going forward. As far as Africa is concerned that remains a very big question mark. Lot of us who have been bullish on the Africa story at an earlier point in time have really not got it right and that remains a question mark. So my suggestion would be to wait and watch rather than bet very aggressively on a stock like this.

  Girish Pai, Head Of Research, Centrum Broking, in a chat with ET now talks about the banking space. 
  
  
  What is your thought on the entire banking pack and more importantly the midcap PSU lot? Do you think the valuations justify the stock price movement?
   
  The banking sector run up has been fairly fast over the last 3-4 months and from that perspective, I am not so comfortable with the banking sector. Bbut since I am more bearish on the global cyclicals and since at this point in time and I am more positively inclined towards the domestic plays, I would still stick to the banks at this point as a neutral weight in my portfolio. 
  
  Within that space, I would say a large part of my weightage would go to the large banks because right now I am cautious on the market. I would want to stay in liquid large cap names but since you mentioned midcap banks, I would want to look at two spaces within the midcap banking area. One are those banks which required capitalisation from the government and some of them have got it - IDBI Bank. There are others who may probably be getting into the next few months or quarters. I think these are plays which could see some serious price to book multiple expansion. That is one area to look at. The other is the oil private sector banks which could be place on domestic consolidation. 
  
  So these are two areas which are long term - 1-2 years plays rather than next quarter plays. That is the way I would look at it.

 The capital raising comes on the back of a strong operating margin performance in Q4 - reflecting cost reduction and margin improvement measures, as well as the expectation of a turnaround in the domestic commercial vehicle market, Ashok Leyland said in a statement. 

 The QIP, launched on June 26, attracted a very favourable response from institutional investors across geographies, it added. 

 ""The issue was subscribed by foreign institutional investors, mutual funds and qualified institutional buyers (QIB) amongst others. The issuance will help improve the debt and the financial position of Ashok Leyland,"" Ashok Leyland Chief Financial Officer Gopal Mahadevan said. 

 The Chennai-based firm allotted 1,852 lakh shares to eligible qualified institutional buyers at an issue price of Rs 36 per share (face value of Re 1 and a premium of Rs 35 per equity share), a premium of 5 per cent to the SEBI floor price, aggregating around Rs 667 crore.

"At Wipro, growth remains a mirage","{""Wipro"": ""negative""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/at-wipro-growth-remains-a-mirage/articleshow/19629040.cms,m.economictimes.com,"At Wipro, growth remains a mirage","BANGALORE: Wipro, the last among India’s large information technology services companies to report March quarter earnings, posted the weakest sales-growth among peers, and gave a poor near-term outlook that could see its sales shrinking marginally in the June quarter.

The company’s management blamed the stagnating sales on discretionary spend not returning and lower exposure in the banking and financial services industry compared with peers.

“In the first month of the quarter, we expected discretionary spend to start coming in, but that did not happen till the end,” said TK Kurien chief executive officer. “That resulted in a large part of our miss in the banking and financial services vertical.”

Kurien added that unfavourable cross-currency movements also hurt sales numbers during the quarter. Wipro’s performance dashed investor hopes of a return to growth for the company, which has been lagging the industry for over a year now. In the just-completed financial year, the company saw sales expanding 5% as against industry growth pace of a little over 10%.

In the March quarter, sales reported in dollars grew 0.5% sequentially, compared with 1.4% for Infosys and a little over 3% for HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services. This was the second worst quarter for the company in the just-concluded financial year, the other being first quarter when revenues fell 1.4%.

Ever since chief executive officer TK Kurien took over in early 2011 after the co-CEO model was dismantled, it has been a story of waiting for investors. The latest financial performance not only fails to give proof of growth taking firm roots, but also signals that it may take much longer for the company to start matching its peers.

“The management has made several changes to the structure to align it more with the demand generation process and increasing efficiency,” said Dipen Shah of Kotak Securities. “We believe that, these initiatives have not yet started showing the expected results and will start reflecting in the financials in due course of time.”

	 


Kurien’s previous commentary over the quarters about putting together a crack team of “hunters” to get multi-hundred million-dollar technology contracts remains a work-in-progress as sales numbers do not seem to show proof of the efforts bearing fruit yet. Client additions, however, continued at reasonable pace with 52 new clients being added in the latest quarter.

While it may not negate the emerging consensus on demand revival in the industry, Wipro’s outlook, taken together with that of Infosys, does question the pace of recovery.

Combined with IBM missing estimates yesterday, Wipro’s dismal outlook does put a question mark on overall technology spending and the nature of technology spending in the current financial year.

The robust numbers coming from HCL Technologies and TCS, and the poor performance from Infosys and Wipro also raises the question about capabilities that different companies have to capture the nature of emerging demand, where newer technology areas such as cloud, mobility and analytics are gaining prominence.

The silver lining in the company’s performance during the March quarter was the jump in consulting revenues, which may signal early-stage projects, where revenue could start kicking in within one to two quarters. But the fall in revenue from Europe is worrisome, especially after the company won one large deal there recently.

Popularising G-Secs among retail investors,"{""G-Secs"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/popularising-g-secs-among-retail-investors/articleshow/34401337.cms,m.economictimes.com,Popularising G-Secs among retail investors,"
	By: P S Reddy

The budget lays out the government borrowing programme in a financial year. But hardly anyone knows the process of borrowing and where the money comes from. World over it is an institutional market with players like banks, pension funds, insurance companies and MFs who participate both in primary and secondary markets. The RBI Working Group Report on enhancing liquidity in government securities devoted a chapter on ‘Retail Participation in G-sec Market’ but has not suggested solutions beyond the existing G-Sec functional framework.


	To begin with, poor retail participation is due to poor awareness. The existing infrastructure for G-Secs including participants such as bank treasury departments and primary dealers, are concentrated in Mumbai. Second, liquidity in the secondary market in G-Sec is conspicuous by its absence. The trading platforms of BSE and NSE for G-Secs have reported nil volume mostly due to poor retail holding. Third hurdle is the complex procedures to transfer securities from a SGL account to demat and vice-versa. Even between depositories interoperability for G-Secs is not permitted.


	The first step in this direction is to issue tax-free bonds which are hitherto issued by PSUs such as REC, PFC and NTPC as government bonds through the branch network of banks, and pass on the proceeds to PSUs. It will increase the liability of GoI. The liability does not stick to the government as the principle and the interest will be serviced by respective PSUs.


	As the banks get commission for distributing these bonds, they will be glad to sell to their customers. In the year 2012-13, Rs 18,000 crore bonds were issued, of which Rs 14,700 crore is through the public issue. In 2013-14, permission to issue tax-free bonds worth Rs 53,000 crore was received of which only Rs  32,000 crore was raised till December, 2013. 
	
	 

	 


	Every year in the Finance Act, the government can make a provision for issuing tax-free bonds on behalf of PSUs. But the government/RBI must issue bonds when the PSU wants them without getting stuck in bureaucracy. The cost of the issue will be borne by the PSU. The difference is that it will be called Government of India Bond and it will be sold through the branch network.


	This process will popularises  G-Secs amongst the public at no additional cost to the government. Although there are ninety-plus G-Secs outstanding, the most active ones are the top five securities with a tenure of ten years which accounts for 80-90per cent of the total G-Sec turnover. About 55per cent of the outstanding G-Secs are held by banks as a part of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) for mandatory compliance irrespective of the return on the securities.


	While RBI concurs that the SLR is required to be reduced over a period for optimum utilisation of resources it is better if a return-reward scheme is devised for availing lower SLR by the banks. RBI may permit banks to sell a part of their SLR securities holding (say 5per cent) to retail investors through their branch network with an offer to buy back from the customers any time during the bond tenure.


	Banks have to display in their branches bid and ask prices on a daily basis much the same way the FD rates are displayed. With this policy framework in place, commercial banks which desire to earn higher returns than what the G-Secs are offering will undertake marketing of G-Secs to its customers.

	 The scheduled commercial banks together hold `20 lakh crore G-Sec as at the end of March, 2013. If RBI permits even a 5per cent of the outstanding amount for offloading to retail investors, it will be `1 lakh crore. To monitor the distribution of G-Secs banks have to open a demat pool account of G-Secs and transfer G-Secs to the demat accounts of customers as and when the transaction takes place. The depositories can furnish MIS to RBI about the SLR securities divested to retail investors.


	The depository for G-Secs is run by RBI which maintains records at ‘nominee’ level as against ‘beneficial owner’ level maintained in CDSL/NSDL. As a result, the RBI will have only the aggregate number of securities of each participant such as a bank or a primary dealer who in turn will have the record of the individual beneficiary owner.


	The depositories have respective CSGL accounts with RBI and the transfer between one beneficial owner in one depository to another beneficial owner in another depository cannot happen without change in CSGL accounts maintained with RBI. As many investors in the secondary market experienced superior infrastructure with a transparent accounting process, they are not able to accept the transfer mechanism in existence for G-Secs. RBI may discard the SGL/CSGL system and ask the banks to hold and transact in G-Secs through CDSL/NSDL. With these three measures which are all doable, the RBI must give it a try.

Strong deals crucial for Wipro's growth push,"{""Wipro"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/wipro-sales-engine-is-getting-stronger-every-quarter-thierry-delaporte/articleshow/93019340.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Wipro sales engine is getting stronger every quarter: Thierry Delaporte,HOLAXD
Ten key takeaways from Wipro Q1 results,"{""Wipro"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/ten-key-takeaways-from-wipro-q1-results/articleshow/48195746.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ten key takeaways from Wipro Q1 results,"BENGALURU: Here are 10 takeaways from the first quarter results of Wipro: 

 
Revenue: Wipro barely managed to meet its own revenue guidance, posting a 1.1% sequential increase in revenues. CEO TK Kurien conceded that the performance was disappointing and said that the results were “not great,” blaming the underperformance on a tough quarter from its energy vertical that took out $200 million from its top-line this quarter. The weak Q1 numbers will now make it nearly impossible for Wipro to post double-digit year-on-year revenue growth this year. 

 
Guidance: Wipro’s guidance of 1.5-3.5% sequential growth in revenue for Q2 indicates a much improved performance ahead, but it still won’t be good enough to make up for the deficit from Q1. The road to consistently strong revenue growth for Wipro looks like a tough one for now and will put even more pressure on Kurien, given that Wipro recently created a COO position to free him up from daily operations and focus only on future strategy and vision. 

 
Hikes for top performers: Wipro HR head Saurabh Govil said that top performers across the company have been rewarded with a 10-15% average hike, with one out of every four Wipro employee receiving a double-digit hike. The wage hikes dragged down the margins for this quarter, and Wipro said the impact of wage hikes will be felt in the next quarter too. Wipro also handed out promotions to about 10,000 junior-level employees. 

 
Hiring and utilisation: Wipro ended the quarter with a total headcount of 161,789, with a gross headcount addition of 3572. Around 12,517 sales and support staff left the company during the quarter -- higher than last quarter’s figure of 11,629. Utilisation inched up by 140 basis points to 81.9% from the last quarter. 

 
Client additions:  Wipro added 36 new customers during the quarter, but the number of $100-million customers dropped by one. The company added two clients in its $75-million customer bucket. Overall, the company was hit hard because of the energy vertical, where most of its top customers cut back on spending due to falling oil prices. Wipro, however, said that things had stabilised in the energy vertical and it was well-poised for growth in the near term. 

 
Verticals: As mentioned earlier, energy proved to be a drag during -- other than E&U, even healthcare faced a tough quarter, while telecom continued to decline as well. 

 
Margins: Margins dropped 120 basis points from last quarter to 21%, hurt mainly by the wage hikes and pricing pressure in the traditional outsourcing business. 

 
Investments in startups: Wipro Ventures made two startup investments during the quarter -- artificial intelligence startup Vicarious and early-stage big data startup Talena. San Francisco-based Vicarious is developing the next-generation of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and solutions that aims to digitally replicate the part of the human brain which controls vision, body and language to enable computers achieve human-level intelligence. What's particularly noteworthy though is that the startup is backed by a long list of notable investors that includes Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Vinod Khosla, Ashton Kutcher, Dustin Moskovitz, Aaron Levie, Sam Altman, Formation 8 and Swiss automation giant ABB. It has raised around $70 million funding until now. 

 
Geographies: Europe proved to be the biggest drag during the quarter, registering a decline in revenues by 11% on a year-on-year basis and by 1.9% on a sequential basis. India and Middle East saw a significant pickup with a 20% y-o-y growth, while the Americas clocked an 8.6% growth in sales. 

 
Holmes and Wipro Digital: CEO TK Kurien said Wipro was making considerable progress on both its artificial-intelligence platform Holmes and its digital business. The investment in Vicarious was part of a broader strategy to boost and add to Holmes’s existing capabilities, Kurien told ET. Wipro Digital, which bought a design firm called Designit earlier in July, won important deals from Allied Irish Bank and the Lawn Tennis Association of the UK.

  Devang Visaria, Chief Strategist, devangvisaria.com, in a chat with ET Now talks about Whirpool.
   
  
  What is your view on Whirlpool?
   
  Whirlpool was on a very smart parabolic rise 3-4 months back and since then it has been just consolidating in a rising kind of small trading channel. Going ahead, I would expect a breakout on the upside. This breakout level is placed at 335 and it is a similar chart to VIP Industries before it moved from 400 to 600. So if you are an aggressive trader, this is the stock for you possibly with a deeper stop loss closer to 290. 
  
  We would look for a first target of 400 and would not be surprised if that was also to be taken out and possibly the stock heads to around 450-475 with a two or three month kind of horizon.

VRL Logistics IPO grey market premium at 38%,"{""VRL Logistics"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/vrl-logistics-ipo-grey-market-premium-at-38/articleshow/46931207.cms,m.economictimes.com,VRL Logistics IPO grey market premium at 38%,"MUMBAI: The demand for the initial public offering of VRL Logistics is slowing picking up. In the grey market, the issue is valued at 38 per cent premium or Rs 78 to the high end of price band, say ET Now sources. 

 Till 2 p.m.; the issue was subscribed 0.27 times as per the NSE website. The valuations are attractive as compared to listed peers and the issue is likely to sail through comfortably, say marketmen. 

 The issue ends on April 17, 2015. 

 VRL specialises in surface logistics and parcel delivery service. It owns and operates the largest fleet of commercial vehicles and has transportation network in 28 States. 

 The company has issued shares to anchor investors such as ICICI Prudential, DSP Blackrock, Birla Sunlife, L&T MF, Sundaram MF, ADIA and East Spring at higher end of the price band at Rs 205/share. 

 The proceeds from the IPO will be utilised to purchase of goods transportation vehicles and repayment of certain borrowings. 

 Brokerages have ??advised investors to ‘Subscribe’ to VRL Logistics IPO. 

 According to IIFL report, at the upper end of Rs195-205 price range, the stock is valued at 14.7x FY16E EPS of Rs 13.9 whereas peers such as Gati and Transport Corporation of India trade in the range of 18x-25x. 

 “We note that apart from plain vanilla surface logistics, these peers also provide niche services like express delivery, ecommerce delivery and supply chain management and therefore trade at higher multiples,” the report said. 

 “Nevertheless, with the improving macroeconomic environment, contribution of freight transportation via road is poised to increase and VRL with its largest fleet size, superior track record, strong brand name, diverse client base, and vast management experience is all set to benefit from the opportunities provide by the sector,” it added.

"IPO after tax row is settled, says Vodafone","{""Vodafone"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/telecom/vodafone-may-not-review-india-ipo-before-ending-tax-row/articleshow/35974768.cms,m.economictimes.com,Vodafone may not review India IPO before ending tax row,"
	MUMBAI: Vodafone Group is unlikely to take a call on whether or not to proceed with its Indian unit’s initial public offering — a plan that was put on the backburner two years ago — until its tax dispute here is resolved and the impact of the next round of spectrum auction on its local finances becomes clear.


	The UK-based telecom major though is hopeful that the new BJPled government would work towards resolving the dispute over the tax, which has now grown to about Rs 20,000 crore, including penalty and interest.


	Local tax authorities had slapped a principal liability of Rs 8,000 crore on Vodafone over its $11-billion deal in 2007 to buy Hutchison Telecommunications International’s majority stake in Hutchison Essar (now Vodafone India). According to officials, the company should have deducted the tax from its payment to Hutchison and paid to the government. Vodafone challenged the claim saying that no tax was payable since it was a deal between two companies based abroad, a view backed by the Supreme Court in January 2012. The government later that year changed laws to tax such transactions retroactively.


	Informal talks to resolve the dispute fell through earlier this year, and Vodafone has invoked international arbitration to resolve the issue.


	In a recent interview, Vodafone India chief executive Marten Pieters told ET that comments from the new Narendra Modi government have raised hope of a more favourable view on the tax case. ""Modi himself and his BJP colleagues have taken a very clear public stance on how bad retrospective tax is. So, they will have a different look at tax, but does that mean the Vodafone tax case will go away?""


	According to him, ""the big boss (Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao) has said that he wants the tax case to be resolved before we can process the IPO, and from his perspective I can imagine he wants a good feeling on the case.""


	The company shelved the India IPO plan in 2012 after the government decided to retroactively change the tax law, which effectively nullified the Supreme Court ruling. Vodafone’s external affairs director Mathew Kirk last week met finance secretary Arvind Mayaram and revenue secretary Rajiv Takru.


	After the meeting, a finance ministry official said the company was keen on conciliation and settling the tax dispute outside the judicial process. The government has to appoint an arbitrator before June 15 following Vodafone’s arbitration notice. The stability of Vodafone India’s balance sheet ahead of the IPO is another key issue that the company would need to consider before deciding on an initial public offering.


	This February, Vodafone India bidRs 19,600 crore to successfully retain airwaves in the 900 MHz band in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata where its licences were up for renewal, and buy 1800 MHz spectrum in 11 other service areas.


	Pieters said Vodafone will fight fiercely to retain 900 MHz in areas where licences will come up for renewal in the next two years. To continue providing services in these places, it will have to buy airwaves through a government auction. The company is also likely to bid for 900 MHz in some circles where it doesn’t have that band of airwaves, Pieters added.


	""We would love to have 900 MHz everywhere, but reality is there are more takers. We will fight for where we have it because it is painful to change the network,"" he said. According to a Deutsche Bank report, based on the outcome of the latest auction in February, Vodafone will likely require as much asRs 31,400 crore to buy 900 MHz spectrum in the six circles where its licences are set to expire at the end of next year. The big fund outgo could weigh on its IPO process.


	 

	An analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage said while Vodafone India’s IPO has been talked about for over three years, and some bankers have worked on it in the past, the bookbuilding process will have to be initiated from the start.


	The process alone would take three months to a year. ""Vodafone already has reputed external auditors and well-documented financials that get reported on the UK entity, so the time line could be lesser for them than some others,"" this executive said.


	Two years ago, Vodafone started reporting its India numbers in the build up to required public disclosures for the IPO. However, worsening of the tax case and the Indian telecom sector in general has resulted in the company shelving the share-sale plan. The person who was to handle the role of company secretary has been redeployed in another finance roll with no clarity on whether he will be needed in the investor-relations role, said a person in the know.

"Amidst commodity boom, vanilla remains plain vanilla","{""vanilla"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/amidst-commodity-boom-vanilla-remains-plain-vanilla/articleshow/6092370.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Amidst commodity boom, vanilla remains plain vanilla","
  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In Kerala's commodity-rich high ranges, swanky automobiles compete for attention with palatial homes, thanks to a sustained commodity price boom. It isn't easy to spot a gloomy face, but look a little deeper and there are the vanilla farmers, who seem to be the odd ones out when the whole region is ecstatic.
  
  Their heartbreak is entirely owed to the collapse of the commodity's price. Raw vanilla prices - that had once ruled at unbelievable levels of Rs 3,000-3,500 per kg, making a few growers millionaires overnight and prompting hundreds of others to take to growing the climber - are now ruling at an equally incredulous rate of Rs 40 per kg.
  
  Some blame it on misleading production figures emanating from Madagascar, the leading producer of the spice, while others say that it is the competition from synthetic vanilla that is keeping natural vanilla prices at such rock bottom levels.
  
  Says John P John, CEO of Kottayam-based Tharakan & Co: ""Many commercial users of vanilla, like ice cream makers, use synthetic vanilla, and several of those users who have once enjoyed the price difference, refuse to return to using natural vanilla. The result has been a sustained slide in vanilla prices, despite a fall in production"".
  
  He says production in the just-concluded season for the whole country was estimated at 60 tonnes, as against about 150 tonnes in the previous year. Despite the steep year-on-year fall in production of raw vanilla beans, the price this year was lackluster, fluctuating from Rs 100 per kg to Rs 40 per kg.
  
  The mood is equally subdued in the villages of Karnataka where vanilla plantations once thrived. According to Ravi Bhat, a vanilla farmer in Uttar Kannada district, the export-oriented nature of the commodity, its demand dependency on the US market, and the infections affecting the vanilla plants have all contributed to the decline in vanilla's fortunes.
  
  ""As against some 4,000-5,000 farmers who grew vanilla some six years ago in the Sirsi region, there are only some 500 sticking to the crop. The present prices are unsustainable for the farmers"", says Bhat. Farmers say they are not just competing with leading producers like Madagascar, Indonesia, Mexico, Uganda and Papua New Guinea, but struggling with different plant infections as well.
  
  The mood is summed up by John P John, who says growers may even stop cultivating the crop. ""The way it is going, vanilla cultivation may disappear in India within a few years"", says John. That is, if infections affecting the plant and the inability of farmers to even maintain their farms with the existing price realizations, do not put a natural end to the crop before that.

  Titan is finding great difficulty in crossing levels of Rs 4200 and chances are that if it does not cross these levels in a hurry, then it could have a fairly sharp decline but for that, it will need to break down below Rs 3850. So, 4200 is a key level. Below that it remains a bit weak.

  Ramanathan K, CIO, ING Investment Management India, talks to ET Now on telecom stocks.
  
   
  
  Do you think these problems are confined to Bharti alone of late by virtue of the foreign currency debt that they have or you are bearish on the telecom space in general as well?
   
  I would not like to comment on a specific stock, I am not allowed to do it but on the sector, we are neutral. Yes, you have regulatory compulsions in terms of the fresh guidelines, which are yet to be formally announced while there have been some information, which has been published in the media. 
  
  Out of the two incremental information, which has come the 8% license fee I do not think so is a major issue but what is an issue is the charging for the extra spectrum, which could impact especially smaller telecom stocks not necessarily Bharti Airtel, so we would use this as an opportunity to increase or overweight the telecom sector rather than sell at current levels because we have seen such volatility during the 3G auction also. 
  
  There were a lot of comments on the auction bids being irrational and so on and so forth and the telecom sector got beaten down quite a lot after that but since then it has been one of the best performing sectors, so we believe that these are opportunities to overweight this sector from a portfolio perspective rather than selling at current levels or going underweight.

Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuations,"{""small caps"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/several-small-caps-trading-at-eye-popping-valuations/articleshow/45092472.cms,m.economictimes.com,Several small caps trading at eye-popping valuations,"MUMBAI: Late last week, when little-known Tilak Finance made it to the MSCI Small Cap index, it stunned many on Dalal Street. The company’s turnover for the year ended March 31, 2014 was Rs 6.42 crore, while its market capitalisation — value of outstanding shares — was Rs 3,861 crore on Friday. The company’s only asset is the 19.2 lakh shares, worth Rs 86 lakh, it owns in Esaar India (not Essar Group).
 
 The inclusion of Tilak Finance along with a couple of others into the MSCI index has put the spotlight on small-cap stocks — many of which are trading at eye-popping valuations. Market watchers said the abnormal values of these stocks suggest operators are active in many of them.
 
 According to an ET study, the market capitalisation-to-sales ratio of nearly 250 actively-traded small-cap stocks is between 50 and 500 times. M-cap-to-sales ratio — one of the several popular valuation matrices — evaluates a stock’s performance vis-à-vis the company’s actual performance. Broadly, a stock with a marketcap-to-sales ratio of less than one can be considered undervalued. But this ratio varies from sector to sector. For instance, the market cap-to-sales of the IT index is 4.2 times; 5 times for fast-moving consumer goods, 1.6 times for capital goods and 0.6 times for oil and gas.
 
 
  “Almost in all these stocks promoter holding is minimal, which makes it easy for the operators to manipulate their stock prices,” said Arun Kejriwal, founder and CEO of KRIS Research.
 
 After a long hiatus, activity in mid- and small-cap stocks revived in February, sparked by the election euphoria. The heightened activity in this category of shares in the last few months is the lengthiest since 2007. For instance, MC Fincorp (formerly Priti Mercantile) has surged over 331% since January 1. The company with a turnover of Rs 10 crore and net profit of Rs 1.28 crore as on March 31, 2014 is currently valued about Rs 5,000 crore in market cap, which is more than the value of more established companies such as Pfizer, IL&FS Transport, JK Lakshmi Cement or Sobha Developers. CCL International, with a net profit of just Rs 99 lakh, is trading at a market cap of Rs 4,906 crore. The stock found place in the recent revamp of MSCI Smallcap Index.
 
 Several companies like Goldline International, Sulabh Engineers & Services, Pine Animation, Surabhi Chemicals & Investments and Mangalam Industrial Finance, among others, with a sales of few crores and profits of a few lakhs traded with a market cap of over Rs 2,000 crore. Officials at larger brokerages said operators are luring retail investors to buy these stocks by sending text message alerts, Whatsapp messages and emails though it is not as rampant as it was in 2006 and 2007.
 
 While capital market regulator Sebi has strengthened its surveillance in recent years, market watchers believe more could be done in the small-cap space. “The stocks that are trading at unreasonable valuations without any reason warrant an investigation for the price manipulations,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD, InGovern Research Services.

 Confirming the news, company officials said Sesa Sterlite Board is scheduled to meet tomorrow for accepting the resignation of Mukherjee, who was the go-to man of Vedanta chief Anil Agarwal in the times of distress. 

 The officials, requesting not to be identified, further said that Mukherjee, who is also a member of the Sesa Sterlite Board, will be demitting office on March 31. 

 Incidently, M S Mehta, CEO of Vedanta Resources Plc and Sesa Sterlite, both, will also be retiring on March 31, making two top level exits from Vedanta group on the same day. 

 Vedanta has already announced appointment of former Rio Tinto boss Tom Albanese as CEO of both the firms from April 1. 

 The sources said that till a successor of Mukherjee, 58, is found, Pramod Unde, currently Chief Operating Officer of the Iron Ore Business, would be heading the business. 

 Mukherjee could not be reached for comments. A company spokesperson did not take calls seeking comments on the matter. 

 Mukherjee is credited with making Sesa Goa India's top private sector iron ore miner by expanding company's operations many folds. Under him, the company saw its peak and possibly its worst period as well. At its peak in 2010-11, Sesa Goa had reported a turnover of Rs 10,152 crore and profit of Rs 4,222 crore. 

 However, imposition of mining bans, first in Karnataka and later in Goa, had a debilitating effect on the company, which is now known as Iron Ore Business of Sesa Sterlite and has led to company reporting a negative EBITDA of 148 crore in the April-December, 2013. 

 Industry sources said that Mukherjee wanted to demit office last year itself but was persuaded to continue as he was leading from the front during the mining ban. While operations in Karnataka has resumed, mining ban in Goa is expected to be lifted soon. 

 A mining industry veteran, Mukherjee has been with Sesa Goa (now Sesa Sterlite) since 1987 and was its Managing Director since April, 2006. He continued as MD of the Goa- based mining firm even after Vedanta group acquired it in 2007 from Japan's Mitsui & Co. 

 Last year in August, when Sesa Sterlite came into existence after merger of Sterlite Industries and some other Vedanta group firms into Sesa Goa, Mukherjee was appointed Executive Director (Iron Ore Business) of the company. 

 His contract with the company is valid till March, 2015. Future moves of Mukherjee are not yet known, though some company officials said that for the time being, he would not be joining any firm and pursue his interests in football and music.

 The capital market regulator has to recover Rs 64.85 lakh from Ranbaxy's former independent director V K Kaul and Rs 12.97 lakh from his wife Bala Kaul. 

 The dues include penalties of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 10 lakh imposed by Sebi on Kaul and his wife in January 2012. 

 In attachment orders dated June 25, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked banks to attach all accounts including lockers held by the couple. 

 Sebi has also directed depositories - NSDL and CDSL - to attach all the demat accounts of the two defaulters. 

 Sebi told the banks and the depositories that there was ""sufficient reason"" to believe that defaulters may dispose of the amounts in the accounts and ""realisation of amount due under the certificate would in consequence be delayed or obstructed"". 

 The regulator has ordered banks and depositories to attach ""all accounts by whatever name called of the defaulter, either singly or jointly with any other persons"". 

 Sebi has also asked banks to attach the lockers held by the entities as well as ""all other amount/proceeds due or may become due to the defaulters or any other money held or may subsequently hold for or on account of defaulter"". 

 It has further ordered the banks and the depositories that no debit would be made in these accounts until further directions. However, the credits, if any, into the account would be allowed. 

 The watchdog has also asked for various details of the accounts held by the entities including account statements. 

 The scrip of Orchid Chemicals saw a huge fall in the last half of March 2008, but then recovered significantly. 

 Several alerts were generated at the NSE and BSE and the scrip was taken up for joint investigation by the exchanges on the basis of which a report was submitted by them in April that year. 

 Bala Kaul had bought several shares of the company on March 27-28, 2008, just prior to the start of share buying by Solrex, a Ranbaxy holding company, on March 31, 2008. 

 It was found that V K Kaul being a connected person of Ranbaxy Laboratories had traded on behalf of his wife in the Orchid Chemical's scrip based on unpublished price sensitive information.

Centralised online system for investor grievances:SEBI,"{""SEBI"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/centralised-online-system-for-investor-grievancessebi/articleshow/7495129.cms,m.economictimes.com,Centralised online system for investor grievances:SEBI,"
  NEW DELHI: Faced with a herculean task of managing and resolving lakhs of investor complaints, market regulator Sebi is putting in place a web-based centralised system for speedy redressal of these grievances.
  
  Sebi's existing investor grievance redressal mechanism lacks a centralised database and the resolution of the complaints often gets delayed due to physical movement of files from one desk to the another across its various offices.
  
  Besides reducing time gap between receipt and redressal of a complaint, the new system would also help in storage of the investor grievances, whose numbers have swelled to over 2.7 million since Sebi's inception, a senior official said.
  
  Sebi had received more than 32,300 investor complaints in 2009-10, while the numbers are even higher at over 39,600 in the first nine months of the current fiscal.
  
  However, the number of complaints are lower as compared to close to 55,000 in 2007-08 and more than 57,500 in 2008-09.
  
  During 2009-10, total 42,742 grievances were redressed, while more than 38,000 complaints were resolved till December in 2010-11.
  
  The Sebi board, in its meeting last week, took note of the ""herculean task"" of storage, maintenance and retrieval of the records related to investor grievances and deliberated over measures to improvise the system, the official added.
  
  The board, which also comprises nominees from the government, was told that Sebi was in the process of upgrading its investor grievance redressal mechanism by setting up the web-based centralised system.
  
  To be called Sebi Complaints Redress System (SCORES), the new system would have a centralised tracking system for all grievances at various offices and divisions of Sebi.
  
  Currently, the list of investor grievances are maintained at various divisions and regional offices of Sebi.
  
  Complaints are also received in various physical and electronic formats.
  
  The new system would also facilitate lodging of complaints pertaining to any of the regional Sebi offices from anywhere.
  
  All the grievances and Action Taken Reports would be in electronic mode and linked to the central server.
  
  Besides, the investors would be able to access online the status of their complaints, including the action taken, if any, on their grievances.
  
  The official said the new system would reduce grievance process time, as physical movements of the complaints would no more be required.

Sebi considers proposal on cross-currency futures pairs,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-considers-proposal-on-cross-currency-futures-pairs/articleshow/48949882.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi considers proposal on cross-currency futures pairs,"MUMBAI: Punters could soon get to trade in cross-currency futures pairs at a much cheaper cost on local bourses. Capital market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which regulates currency derivatives jointly with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is mulling a proposal by stock exchanges to offer these pairs in addition to dollar- and eurorupee futures they currently offer.
 
 ""We are considering the proposal as we want to introduce new products and are in discussions with the RBI,"" said a regulatory official aware of the development. ""Once the central bank approves it, exchanges could launch cross-currency pairs like dollar-euro, dollar-pound and dollar-yen.""
 
 Currency derivatives were launched first on NSE and the erstwhile MCX Stock Exchange, now MSEI, in 2008. Currently, punters can take a view on how the rupee will move against the dollar, euro, yen and pound on bourses like NSE, BSE and MSEI.
 
 Currency brokers like Suresh Nair, director at Admisi Forex, said, if allowed, the move would reduce one leg of a transaction for traders and reduce transaction costs.
 
 For instance, if one has a view that the dollar would rise against the euro, currently she has to sell the rupee and buy the dollar, or go long dollar-rupee. In the second leg she sells the euro and buys the rupee, effectively making her long dollar and short euro.
 
 If bourses launch new cross-currency pairs, a trader who feels the dollar would rise versus the euro could simply go long dollar and short euro. This will save her brokerage on the extra leg and reduce transaction costs, too.
 
 ""At times it has been observed that the dollar, while not exhibiting much movement against the rupee, moves sharply against the euro or the yen. If one wants to take a future view on the dollar-euro or dollar-yen, they would have to either long/short dollar-rupee and short/long euro-rupee. If indeed the RBI permits new cross-currency pairs for being traded, it will increase interest in currency derivatives and raise the combined turnover of all the exchanges,"" said Harish Galipelli, head of currency at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities.
 
 While regulators approved currency derivatives primarily to offer an alternate and cheaper hedging option, than the OTC market, to small and medium scale industry, brokers say, it has been largely a speculative play, with proprietary trades accounting for almost 60 per cent of turnover.
 
 Jamal Mecklai, CEO of Mecklai Financial, a forex consultancy, attributes this to an SME having to eventually convert its forex inflow or outflow with an authorise dealer (bank), where it might not get as attractive a rate it does for hedging in the futures market. Besides, on the futures market liquidity is restricted to the front and the next month contracts; far month contracts being relatively less traded. ""Cross-currency futures will probably attract more punters than genuine users as the current experience proves,"" added Mecklai.
 
 In the week through Friday, combined currency derivatives turnover of NSE, BSE and MSEI (erstwhile MCX-SX) was Rs 1.22 lakh crore. NSE led with a market share of around 62 per cent, BSE at 32.5 per cent and MSEI the rest.

Sebi plans new norms for municipal bonds,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/sebi-plans-new-norms-for-municipal-bonds/articleshow/37008645.cms?from=mdr,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Sebi plans new norms for municipal bonds,"NEW DELHI: To provide new investment avenues to public and institutional players, market regulator Sebi is working on fresh guidelines for municipal bonds -- a popular financial product in developed countries like the US.
 
 The market for municipal bonds, also known as 'muni bonds', is yet to take off in India even though few municipalities here have offered such products in the past, while Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in Gujarat was the first to launch such a bond way back in 1998.
 
 Muni bonds are very popular among investors in many developed nations, especially the United States, where muni bonds have attracted investments totalling over USD 500 billion and are among preferred avenues for household savings.
 
 These bonds are issued by urban local bodies to finance infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation. They serve as an efficient tool for local bodies to mop up funds and can be extensively tapped to meet funding needs of urbanisation.
 
 While there is already an existing framework for issuance of muni bonds, including by the Ministry of Urban Development, there are no unified norms to bolster this nascent market.
 
 When asked about municipal bonds, Sebi chairman U K Sinha said there is a ""preliminary thinking"" at the capital markets regulator and other authorities would be consulted soon.
 
 ""It will have to be a joint effort of Sebi, Ministry of Finance and of course the concerned state government. Preliminary thinking is there ... may be after a couple of months, especially when some of the programmes from the government are very well known. Everyone are waiting for budget announcements, things will move in that direction,"" Sinha said on the sidelines of an event over the weekend.
 
 The fresh push for muni bonds also comes at a time when the regulators and government are looking at ways to channelise household savings into the market to boost overall economic growth.
 
 India's savings rate stood at little over 30 per cent of the GDP in 2012-13 fiscal while household savings rate was nearly 22 per cent during the same period.
 
 In India, muni bonds were issued for the first time by a municipality in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 Way back in 1998, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation had become the first municipality to come out with muni bonds. Since then few others, including Greater Vishakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, had issued such bonds.
 
 India would need more than USD 800 billion investments to cater to the urban infrastructure needs over two decades, as per industry chamber Assocham, and muni bonds can serve as an effective fund-raising instrument in this regard.
 
 Besides the US, other countries with a developed muni bond market include Canada and Russia.

Sebis reading of control issue confounds experts,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebis-reading-of-control-issue-confounds-experts/articleshow/29128499.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi’s reading of ‘control’ issue confounds experts,"MUMBAI: Market regulator Sebi’s informal guidance on the issue of control of a company in case of R System International and Bhavook Tripathi has baffled corporate lawyers. 

 In its interpretative letter, Sebi has said that unless the shareholder actually acquires control of the company, he would be considered a public shareholder. A Delhi-based software company R System International has requested Sebi not to classify Bhavook Tripathi, who holds 34.82% in the company, as a public shareholder since by virtue of his holding, Tripathi can influence the company in a significant way. R System pleaded that one of the ways in which Tripathi can exercise such influence is by his ability to block matters requiring shareholders’ nod by way of a special resolution under the Company’s Act 1956. 

 Sebi, while informally terming the acquirer as a non-promoter, seems to have given credence to the fact that there’s still no clarity on the control of the company. “I don’t think Sebi’s informal guidance in case of R System International is correct,” said Huzzefa Nasikwala, founder, Nasikwala Law Chambers. 

 “In India, there’s no yardstick to define promoters in terms of their stake, as persons with as low as 25% can control a company. 

 On the other hand, a person who can influence the company in a significant way with over one-third stake, has been treated as a public shareholder,” he added. In R System, Tripathi made an open offer and his stake rose to 34.82%. While the promoters held 50.17%, thereby leaving the public shareholding at 15%, which is less than the required minimum of 25%. According to the Sebi takeover regulations, the acquirer was required to cut stake to ensure the target company complies with the minimum public holding norm of 25%. But if the acquirer is treated as public shareholder, he is not required to reduce his shareholding in the company. 

 This is somewhat different from the regulator’s stance in other cases such as Subhkam Investments and Clearwater where Sebi had been critical and strict on the issue of ‘control’. The issues raised in the recent informal guidance on R System International signals certain broader trends in the regulatory thought-process, say lawyers. 

 “If the current informal guidance can be seen as Sebi’s relaxation of its past stance, then probably large investors in future should not face Sebi’s stiff resistance while showcasing that merely because of their substantial shareholding, they should not be construed as exercising control over the company and tagged as a promoter,” said Tejesh Chitlangi, partner, IC Legal. While the Sebi informal guidance favours potential acquirers, it leaves some possibilities and many questions open, say corporate lawyers. 

 “It may be possible for a single investor to hold a significant stake and still be treated as part of the public,” said U Umakanth, a corporate law expert. “However, the question as to whether such a large shareholding through which negative control can be exercised by blocking special resolutions would amount to ‘control’ has not been specifically answered, though one can deduce from the result of the informal guidance that Sebi does not believe this to amount to ‘control’.

20 companies approach Sebi with public offer proposals,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/20-companies-approach-sebi-with-public-offer-proposals/articleshow/45639851.cms,m.economictimes.com,20 companies approach Sebi with public offer proposals,"NEW DELHI: Looking to tap into the upbeat investor sentiment, as many as 20 companies including Videocon D2H, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd and Adlabs Entertainment have filed initial papers with market regulator Sebi for their public offers. 

 Since January this year, 20 companies have filed their draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with Sebi to launch an initial public offer (IPO), while SMC Global Securities Ltd sought Sebi's approval for its follow-on public offer (FPO). 

 Barring Sharda Cropchem and GMR Energy, other 18 firms filed their initial papers after the general election verdict was announced in mid-May. 

 Sharda Cropchem filed its draft document in February and GMR Energy sought Sebi's approval in March. However, GMR Energy withdrew its application in April. 

 Of these firms, Sebi has already given nod to the IPOs of Lavasa Corporation, Adlabs Entertainment, Ortel Communications and MEP Infrastructure Developers. However, these four companies are yet to launch their public offers. 

 Besides, the regulator has sought clarification or additional information from the merchant bankers of some of the companies. 

 Most of the companies plan to utilise IPO proceeds for capacity expansion as well as working capital requirements. 

 Of these 20 firms, only two companies -- Sharda Cropchem and Monte Carlo Fashions -- got listed on the stock exchanges. 

 According to market experts, landslide victory of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the general elections has perked up investor sentiment and prompted companies to file IPO papers. 

 Analysts expect a spurt in IPO market next year because many firms which has received Sebi's approval may launch their public offers in 2015. 

 So far in 2014, the 30-share benchmark Sensex has gained over 28 per cent spurred by robust fund flows and revival of risk appetite amid signs of improving economic conditions.

Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/minimum-shareholding-norm-not-for-non-controlling-entity-sebi/articleshow/28560945.cms,m.economictimes.com,Minimum shareholding norm not for non-controlling entity: Sebi,"MUMBAI: A non-promoter entity can't be asked to reduce stake in a listed company if its purchase of shares, without acquiring control of the firm, leads to non-compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 The views have been expressed by market regulator Sebi in an 'interpretive letter' issued to a company, R Systems International, which had sought an 'informal guidance' on this matter in relation to purchase of a significant stake by a non-promoter entity. 

 Sebi noted that the non-promoter entity belonged to the category of public shareholders since ""the prime objective behind the acquisition is the investment value in the equity shares of the target company (R Systems) and not substantial holding of shares/voting rights/control or management of the target company. 

 ""Therefore until and unless the acquirer actually acquires control of the target company, the acquirer would be considered as public."" 

 As per the company submissions, Bhvook Tripathi, a non-promoter entity, had acquired shares of the firm that increased his stake in the company to over 30 per cent and resulted in fall of public shareholding below the 25 per cent prescribed limit. 

 R Systems had sought Sebi's views on whether the share purchase by Tripathi will be treated as part of the non-public holding of the company and if so will the acquirer be required to reduce its stake in the company to ensure compliance with the minimum public shareholding norms. 

 As per Sebi rules, an entity is obligated to bring down its shareholding to the level specified for maximum permissible non-public shareholding (75 per cent) within a stipulated time. 

 However, in the case of R Systems, Sebi noted that Tripathi belonged to the category of public shareholder as he was neither a promoter nor a person acting in concert with the promoters and had bought shares for investment purposes and not for acquiring control in the company. 

 Moreover, Sebi said that going by the shareholding pattern of R Systems for quarter ending September 2013, Tripathi was listed as a public shareholder. 

 ""The expression acquirer has been defined as any person who directly or indirectly acquires shares or voting rights in or control over a target company either by himself, or through or with any person acting in concert with him. 

 ""As per the definition the acquirer means any person which is includes both promoter and public,"" Sebi said.

 ""These (clearing corporations) are also subjected, on an on-going basis, to rules and regulations that are consistent with the PFMI issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO),"" Sebi said. 

 The international standards were issued in April 2012 and all G-20 nations were to required to adhere to these strict standards to check derivative-related risks in the financial system. 

 These rules were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, settlement, and recording arrangements, and more broadly, to limit systemic risk and foster transparency and financial stability. 

 QCCP is an entity that is licensed to operate as a central counterparty (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption) and is permitted by the appropriate regulator to operate as such with respect to the products offered. 

 Clearing Corporations undertakes the activity of clearing and settlement of trades in securities or other instruments or products that are dealt with or traded on stock exchanges.

Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-mulls-prudential-governance-norms-for-stock-brokers/articleshow/43069625.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi mulls prudential governance norms for stock brokers,"NEW DELHI: After prescribing a new Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, capital markets watchdog Sebi is now mulling over a new set of Prudential Governance Norms for stock brokers to safeguard investors' interest. 

 The proposed norms, which are currently at draft stage and are going through consultations, would considerably enhance the disclosure requirements by stock brokers and can subject them to tightened regulations with regard to related party transactions and audit of their books and other dealings. 

 Besides, the brokers may also be required to put in place a whistle-blower mechanism and frame an effective 'code of conduct' for their directors and senior management personnel, in line with similar norms for listed companies as prescribed by Sebi and in the new Companies Act, sources said. 

 These norms have been proposed by Sebi to ensure that any adverse impact on the interest on investors as well as on the integrity of securities markets can be avoided in the event of any lapses at the end of stock broker. 

 Sebi is aiming to ""minimise/prevent occurrence of circumstances leading to default in making payments by stock brokers to stock exchanges or clients due to lack of due diligence in their risk management system, due to mis-management leading to instability or failure in operations of stock broker including insolvency etc"" with these norms. 

 The new corporate governance norms for listed companies are coming into effect from October 1. However, Sebi recently relaxed some provisions after representations from the industry bodies and the government and it has given time till April 1, 2015 for a key provision of having minimum one woman director on the boards of listed companies. 

 A senior official said that the brokers have also already begun making representations before the regulator with concerns that any tightening of corporate governance norms could hurt their business due to high compliance costs. 

 The brokers are arguing that they are already operating in a highly regulated business and the new Companies Act has already provided for significant tightening of norms for the corporate brokerage firms. 

 Among others, the proposed norms would require brokers to submit their audited annual reports within 60 days of end of a financial year and a half-yearly networth certificate within two months of the end of a half-year to the stock exchange. 

 The quarterly financial results would be required to be submitted within 45 days of end of each quarter, while annual audit would need to be done by ""an independent, competent and qualified auditor"". 

 No stock broker would be allowed to re-appoint an individual as an auditor for more than one term for five consecutive years. In case of an audit firm, it can be appointed for maximum two terms of five consecutive terms. 

 In their periodic financial disclosures, the brokers would have to separately mention the advance or margins received from their clients, as also any advance or loans given by them. 

 Details of loans, advances or investments in subsidiaries, associates or group companies, as also all material information about their financial position, performance, governance and ownership, would need specific disclosures. 

 The brokers would also need to disclose all exceptional income and expenditure, along with auditors' observations, while their quarterly and annual financial results would need to be approved by the board of director and CEO/CFO along with a certification of ""absence of falsity or omission"". 

 The board of directors would need to lay down a code of conduct for all board members and senior management of the company, and also devise an effective whistle blower mechanism enabling all stakeholders, including employees, to freely communicate their concerns about any illegal or unethical practices. 

 The board would have to ensure that the interest of a whistle-blower is not prejudicially affected. 

 With regard to investor grievance, a compliance officer would need to ensure that they are redressed in a stipulated manner and within a given timeline. The status of all investor complaints would need to be reviewed and analysed every six months and corrective steps would be required to be taken by the compliance officer to ""minimise recurrence in future"". 

 The CEO of the company would need to certify that ""there are no transaction entered into by the stock broker during the year which are fraudulent, illegal or violating the stock broker's code of conduct"". 

 The certification would also include that the auditor has been informed about any significant changes in the internal control over financial reporting or in accounting policies, as also about the ""instances of significant fraud of which they have become aware and the involvement therein, if any, of the management or an employee"".

Sebi orders defreezing of accounts of five entities,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-orders-defreezing-of-accounts-of-five-entities/articleshow/40300973.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi orders defreezing of accounts of five entities,"MUMBAI: Capital market regulator Sebi has ordered defreezing of bank accounts and securities accounts of five entities, so far in August, as it successfully recovered pending dues amounting to over Rs 54 lakh from the defaulters. 

 Sebi had earlier ordered attachment of bank accounts and demat accounts of -- Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Prem M Parikh, Bharat S Thakkar, Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Hemant Kumar Motihar -- to recover the penalties imposed on them for violation of capital market norms. 

 In separate release orders issued this month, the market watchdog said it has recovered Rs 33.44 lakh from Hemant Madhusudan Sheth, Rs 7.1 lakh from Prem M Parikh, Rs 6.46 lakh from Bharat S Thakkar, Rs 4.54 lakh from Dhamaka Trading and Construction and Rs 2.57 lakh from Hemant Kumar Motihar. 

 Together these dues amount to Rs 54.14 lakh. They include interest and other expenses along with the penalties. 

 Stating that it had collected ""full and final settlement of the dues"" from the defaulters, Sebi directed the banks and depositories - NSDL and CDSL - to defreeze the accounts of the entities. 

 ""...you are hereby directed to release the bank accounts/ lockers/demat accounts, of the defaulter attached, if any, pursuant to the notice of attachment,"" the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in the release orders. 

 Till July-end, the market regulator was able to recover penalties worth nearly Rs 7 crore from several defaulters. 

 Sebi had began passing orders earlier this year to defreeze bank accounts and demat accounts of entities which made the payment of outstanding dues. 

 The capital markets watchdog began initiating attachment proceedings against defaulters, including individuals and companies, in October last as per the greater powers granted to it through an ordinance promulgated by the government. 

 Since then, the Sebi has launched nearly 1,400 attachment proceedings for recovery of penalties imposed in as many as 393 cases. These proceedings involve attachment of bank accounts, movable and immovable properties, shares and debentures, among others. 

 The market regulator is looking to recover penalties aggregating to nearly Rs 1,700 crore imposed on various entities.

 The proposed study will also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others. 

 The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by capital markets regulator Sebi for the next financial year beginning April 1, 2014, for which it has identified 'capacity building' as a core focus area, a senior official said. 

 According to the proposed move, a comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to understand the ""trend/pattern discovery by regulators in developed markets like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong"" in order to keep pace with the ever increasing globalisation of Indian markets. 

 ""The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc,"" the official added. 

 In 2014-15, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) also plans to organise an International Research Conference with an aim to commence a dialogue on ways to tackle newer challenges faced by securities markets by ameliorating the pool of research talent around the world. 

 Sebi, which was established on April 12, 1988, has also proposed to organise a Foundation Day lecture each year, beginning the next fiscal by inviting a Nobel laureate or an eminent person from the fields like economics and finance to talk on relevant issues for securities markets. 

 With regard to Sebi's capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously. 

 At present, Sebi's average training budget per person per year is the lowest among all its peer regulators, while the area of skill development also needs a further fillip. 

 While Sebi is already working on increasing its staff strength in a gradual manner from about 700 currently, it is looking to achieve quality enhancement of staff through better training and skill enhancement measures, so as to further bolster the supervisory and regulatory capacity of the organisation.

"Sebi, exchanges to tighten grip on speculative stocks","{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-exchanges-to-tighten-grip-on-speculative-stocks/articleshow/41135774.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi, exchanges to tighten grip on speculative stocks","MUMBAI: The capital market regulator and stock exchanges are planning to tighten their grip over small-cap and penny stocks that are susceptible to manipulation. The Securities and Exchange Board of India and the bourses may introduce a new segment called T+ Group, under which margin requirements would be steep and circuit filters would be lower.
 
 At present, stock exchanges try to prevent manipulation by transferring them to the trade-to-trade segment or T Group.. In this segment, traders have to take delivery of the shares they buy, while the daily maximum tradable limit is 5% on either side.
 
 Exchanges shift stocks to the T Group when there is speculation and unusual movement on the back of higher-than-average volumes. These requirements result in a fall in unnatural activity in such shares. The plan to introduce a new segment comes on the heels of reports of manipulation in stock prices during inclusion into or exclusion from the T Group.
 
 The T+ Group would include shares that have been in the T Group for over three months and whose price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is less than 250 and book value is less than 30 times, said a source familiar with the matter. “Exchanges have got complaints that there is still a lot of manipulation despite stocks being shifted to the T Group. So, they felt there is a need for a new group,” said a source in the know.
 
 Under the T+ Group, margin requirement of 500% and 100% will be introduced on sell and buy transactions respectively. Funds and shares wo
uld be released by the clearing corporation of the exchange only after a month, while the circuit filter would be even lesser than 5%. It has also been proposed that at the time of review, the companies having a P/E greater than 50 times or price-to-book greater than 10 times, will be eligible for moving out of T+ Group to T Group.
 
 Earlier this month, bourses moved almost 550 stocks out of the T Group after they were convinced that speculation has receded. The T Group was introduced shortly after the Ketan Parekh scam in 2001 but the detailed norms of how, when and why shares would be put under surveillance were not disclosed until November 2010.

  There is nothing in the chart. Till it breaks 2400, I do not see a big move. I do not see that happening very soon but I do not see it cracking down, going below 2270-2280. So broadly 2270-2350, that is the range.
  
  
  What do you make out of generally in terms of the midcap side of the market?
  
  We have had decent moves in midcaps also, but I would agree that it has been very specific and selective. You did not have a whole host of midcaps moving, but even in the banking space, you have a State Bank which is sideways but you have a Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank which is ready to move 5-7% even from current levels. So it is more of choosing and picking of stocks. It is not this or that. Some of this, some of that is what I feel.

The Bank Nifty has broken down. SBI is a very important constituent of that index. A lot of other PSU banking stocks are showing weak patterns. If somebody was short at 1950 or 2000 strike call option, we will hardly have any premium left. So, it make sense to cover them up.  Plus 1650 broadly was a strike where some put writing was observed earlier but that has been covered up with the fact that stock prices are now trading below those levels. So, I would not remain long on SBI or any other banking stocks via the futures or the options route for the time being. Cover up all positions of SBI.

 LONDON: Come Monday, global equity markets will wake up to a new $558 billion magnet pulling cash out of developing nations from Russia to Malaysia. 

 As Saudi Arabia lifts a ban on direct investments by foreigners, fund allocators are preparing to shift money out of other countries and put it to work in the Arab world's largest stock market. While there's little consensus on which country will be the biggest loser, money managers mostly agree that energy producers will feel the heaviest effects. Below are the views of seven emerging-markets investors and strategists on what to expect: 

 Martial Godet, head of emergingmarket equities and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas SA in Paris: 

 Saudi Arabia “will not be a bargain, but it can be a nice diversification from emerging Asia that has become increasingly large within emerging markets. The biggest losers will be markets associated with oil and energy: Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia.“ 

 Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging-markets strategist at NN Investment Partners in The Hague: 

 “Investors will eventually sell a bit across the board to get to a decent weight in Saudi Arabia. There might be a bit more selling in other oil countries, but then we should ask ourselves what are the pure oil plays in emerging-markets, comparable to Saudi Arabia? Only Russia comes close.“ 

 Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital in London: 

 “The UAE and Qatar may suffer. After Saudi Arabia's inclusion in MSCI EM, investors might think: why bother looking at small Qatar when you can choose Saudi to be your Gulf proxy?“ 

 James Bannan, who oversees the $150 million Frontier Markets Fund at Coeli Asset Management in Mal mo, Sweden: 

 “Most of the large frontier-market funds already have decent exposure to Saudi Arabia. If they were to increase their exposure, it would come from allocations in the region, namely Kuwait, the UAE., Qatar and Oman.“ 

 Rami Sidani, the head of frontier markets at Schroder Investment Management in Dubai: 

 “The event of Saudi Arabia opening up is a very positive development for the entire Gulf region, as it graduates to becoming an investment destination for emerging-market funds. The Gulf market won't be able to be disregarded by international investors as an asset class.“ 

 Julian Mayo, co-chief investment officer at Charlemagne Capital in London: 

 “This move will gradually benefit Saudi in the next two years, as Saudi becomes investible to a wider range of investors, but we don't expect any specific market to suffer as a result of this move. Ultimately, stock performance depends on fundamentals of earnings and valuations.“ 

 Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, the head of the Europe, Middle East, Africa and global frontier markets equity team at Baring Investment Services in London: 

 “I don't think there is going to be a massive knock-on effect to start with from the day of the opening, as the market is being opened in a very limited way with a lot of requirements for anyone wanting to go into the market directly. We are already in Saudi Arabia. It's an out-ofindex position in my fund, which is around 20 %.""

  ""The company has secured term loan of Rs 50 crore and Rs 22 crore from the State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, respectively for the project, while Rs 36.90 crore shall be raised through this IPO to part finance the project,"" Sanghvi said.
  
  ""In a pre-IPO placement, the company has sold close to seven lakh equity shares at Rs 80 per piece to a German company Dango & Dinethal Mascinenbau (GMBH), with the lock in period of one year,"" he said.
  
  The company turnover stood at Rs 29.50 crore in the third quarter of 2010-11 ending December, of which 20 per cent accounts for exports. It reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 3 crore.

  ""Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) informs that S K Roongta ceases to be the chairman of SAIL with effect from May 31, 2010, on attaining the age of superannuation,"" the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.
  
  ""Further, the company informs that Soiles Bhattacharya Director (Finance) SAIL has been given the additional charge of Chairman SAIL,"" it added.
  
  Bhattacharya is the senior most director in SAIL. Official sources said that he has been given the additional charge for a period of three months or until further orders are issued.
  
  The steel ministry had to appoint an interim chairman, as there were delays in approval of state-owned BHEL's C S Verma for the top job in the steel PSU. Government's headhunter Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Verma for the post of chairman of SAIL.
  
  While most of the clearances for Verma were in place, his appointment was not yet confirmed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), pending which Bhattacharya has been appointed as the interim chairman.
  
  A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said that recently certain clarifications were sought from the ACC over appointment of a new chairman of SAIL.
  
  ""The Steel Ministry has already sent its reply on Verma's appointment to the ACC,"" he added.
  
  Steel minister Virbhadra Singh had last month said that he has already approved Verma's name for the post of SAIL chairman and recommended the same to the ACC.
  
  Bhattacharya assumes the responsibility of the country's largest steel firm at a time, which analysts say could be ""a very difficult time for the steel industry"", which is hit by rising prices of raw material like iron ore and coking coal and slackening demand ahead of the monsoon.

  NEW DELHI: State-run Steel Authority of India, or Sail, the country’s largest steel producer, has initiated the process for its Rs. 7,000 crore follow-on public offer (FPO) and is planning to enter the market by March end or early April.
  
  The issue that was scheduled to enter the market in the second week of February was delayed after the state-run company objected to the conflict of interest of four investment bankers advising the issue. These bankers had also accepted a mandate for Tata Steel, which entered the market in January. The company had issued notices to these bankers alleging that advising Tata Steel, which was also from the same sector, amounted to conflict of interest. 
  
  “The issue with the bankers have been resolved and we will attempt to enter the market by the end of March, depending upon the market condition,” SAIL chairman CS Verma told ET.
  
  On Thursday, the department of disinvestments met senior officials of steel ministry, SAIL and representatives of six investment bankers to give the green signal for the FPO. “Bankers have done significant due diligence on the mandate. It will take two more weeks to prepare the prospectus that will be filed with the Sebi,” a banker told ET.
  
  The exact timing of the issue will depend upon the Rs. 12,000-crore share sale by exploration behemoth Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, a senior official of the department of disinvestments said. The proposed issue comprises 5% of fresh issue by the company and a share sale of a similar amount by the government.

  The rupee-dollar pair is moving in a consolidation range of 44-46 levels for the past eight months. The short- term trend is up, after making a low of 43.90 (April 2011), for the past one month. 
  
  
  We expect the pair to see a short-term upmove to test the 45.30-45.50 levels. Any minor decline from current levels will garner support in the range of 44.75 to 44.85. Equity markets are under pressure after RBI’s rate hike of 50 bps, dismal quarterly results by most companies, high commodity prices and inflation. 
  
  
  FIIs have sold equity worth Rs 5,140 crore in the month of May so far, which suggests that FIIs are bearish in the near-term. No major IPO is lined up this week and the usual month-end dollar demand from oil companies will be seen in the market.

Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,"{""Rupee"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-swings-hand-arbitrage-advantage-to-day-traders/articleshow/45635008.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rupee swings hand arbitrage advantage to day traders,"MUMBAI: With the rupee turning volatile against the dollar, day traders have tapped an arbitrage opportunity within a short span between the exchange traded futures and domestic over-the-counter forward markets. 

 The intensity on Tuesday was about 5-10 paise compared with zero to three paise a week or two ago in the 1-month contract category. Traders were seen buying the January contract in the dollar-rupee pair at about 63.82/$ while selling the similar maturity forward contract at 63.87-63.88. The gap, or spread, was on the higher end in other pairs like euro-rupee or pound-rupee or yen-rupee. 

 “Traders have initiated fresh long positions for the last two weeks as the rupee has turned volatile,” said Sajal Gupta - head (forex and interest rate), Edelweiss Financial Services. 

 “Earlier, they were enjoying premium of a stable exchange rate. Intra-day sharp volatility led to some arbitrage opportunities.” The average daily futures volume has nearly doubled to 11,300 crore compared with 6,050 crore in the first fortnight of the month, show data from NSE. 

 Between December 15 and 23, the rupee has swung from 62.46 to 63.89 per dollar, a movement as high as 2.29%, or 143 paise. 

 “After being ranged and quiet for nearly five months, dollar/rupee sprang to life since the first week of December,” said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities. “Since then, turnover or participation has increased in all the three pillars of financial markets, viz., speculators, arbitrageurs and hedgers have become active.” 

 Over the past one week, the offshore non-deliverable forward market has been tepid as most traders have gone on leave ahead of year-end festivities globally. 

 The spreads, or gaps, with non-deliverable forward (NDF) from two domestic markets have shrunk to near zero from eight or 10 paise discount earlier. This, too, has fuelled arbitrages between domestic futures and forwards. Futures, forwards and NDFs all are the rupee derivatives. 

 Such large arbitrage opportunities have been lapped up by traders, which has helped in pumping up the volume on the exchange, dealers said. “We have seen arbitrage between futures and forward markets whenever there is demand-supply mismatch and sudden exchange rate volatility,” said Abhishek Goenka, founder & CEO, India Forex Advisors. 

 Arbitrage opportunities wane as and when the exchange rate turns to a particular trending, be it down or up instead of sharp swings. Traders’ rush to tap such opportunities is also being blamed. 

 “That too has not lasted long, as players have captured the difference and consequently, the contracts on OTC and exchange are now almost back at parity,” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, the local unit trended down against the greenback to close the day’s trading at 63.52 per dollar, weakened 0.38% from a day earlier. 

 Oil companies were seen buying dollars in the domestic forwards to meet their month-end demand.

These were the very sectors which RIL was barred from entering after the Reliance empire was split between the two brothers . Now, with the truce in place, the AGM would put an official seal on the patch-up , something which shareholders having been hoping to witness for a long time.
  
  What began as a bitter period of animosity between the Ambani brothers five years ago, could well come to an end on Friday, if Anil Ambani attends, something which no one is confirming but everyone is talking about. Anil is expected to represent himself as an ‘ordinary shareholder' , this time to express his gratitude for the truce agreement between RIL and his group.
  
  
  Shareholders expect big announcements
  
  The AGM of RIL would mark a breakaway from what shareholders saw at the August 2005 AGM, when an emotional Anil Ambani had said: ‘‘ Today, it is a very emotional day for me as I stand here with the blessings of my beloved mother Kokilaben . She has given birth to me twice. First, on June 4, 1959 and the second one on June 18, 2005. Both Mukesh and I could not be in front of you without her support and blessings.” Perhaps, June 18, 2010 would mark another rebirth for Anil.
  
  Ironically, he had sought his elder brother's blessings even then, when he was getting started on building his own empire. In all probability , this year's AGM could be like a ‘home coming' for Anil and his family, given the thaw in relations between the two factions.Shareholders could indeed witness a special ‘Kodak ’ moment if the two families happen to be seated together in the front row, just like old times.
  
  However, one sticky subject which Mukesh could touch upon at the AGM is the gas pricing issue for ADAG's power business. Mukesh had, in past AGMs, briefed shareholders on the gas dispute, which has been the main bone of contention between the two brothers ever since the Reliance empire was split. Said Shailesh Mehta, an RIL shareholder , who owns 32 shares of the company since it went public in 1977, ‘‘ I’m expecting the chairman to make big announcements at the AGM. We expect a new vision for RIL.”
  
  Clearly, the mood is already upbeat as to what Mukesh would unveil at the AGM.

Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,"{""richly valued stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/should-you-opt-for-richly-valued-stocks/articleshow/44867043.cms,m.economictimes.com,Should you opt for richly valued stocks?,"The holy grail of stock market investing has forever remained elusive: fundamentally sound companies trading at cheap valuations. Like all good things in life, the top performers of the equity universe—companies that boast stable cash flows, high profit margins and efficient management, among others—carry the burden of high valuations, with their shares trading at substantial premiums to the broader indices as well as their peers.

This presents a dilemma for investors and experts alike. Some people like Vikas Gupta, executive vice-president, Arthveda Fund Management, questions the obsession with 'quality'. ""People are paying through their nose for these stocks. There is no doubt about the solid fundamentals of these companies, but there is a limit to the premium one should be paying for them,"" he says. Gupta believes such valuations cannot be sustained for long. ""There are other companies that are valued at much lower prices, and when these sectors and companies start showing results, money will be pulled out from the highperforming set of stocks,"" he argues.

Therefore, Gupta cautions investors against blindly buying the so-called highquality stocks. ""Unless there is a strong likelihood of the company's sales doubling within the next 2-3 years, and this positive development has not been factored in in the pricing of the stock, paying such a high price for it just does not make sense,"" Gupta adds.

In spite of the warnings by experts, there is always a good reason to track these fundamentally strong companies that have been commanding rich valuations in the market across time periods because of the opportunities they might throw up. Here, we have restricted our search to the CNX100 universe and included only those high-performing stocks that have been around for the past 10 years (since October 2004). The stock-picking filters left us with 79 stocks. Next, we compared the monthly average price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for each of these stocks against the monthly average PE of the Nifty index for the period under consideration. This exercise revealed the number of occasions on which each stock traded at a premium to the benchmark index, helping us identify the final list of perennially expensive stocks.

We have also compared the 10-year median PE of these stocks with the current PE to check where they stand today in terms of historical valuations. To determine the median, we first sort the list in ascending order, then pick the middle value. Comparing it to the average or mean valuation, the median value is a much more realistic interpretation of the market, especially if the data distribution is asymmetrical, which is the case for many of the stocks under consideration. Let's dig deeper into the final list of eight high-performing stocks and assess where they stand in terms of their fundamentals.

Stocks that have consistently traded at premium valuations

				

Asian Paints

The market leader in the paints business has always commanded a hefty premium in the stock market. Its superior pricing power due to its leadership position has allowed the company to maintain healthy profit margins throughout the past decade.

Over the past 2-3 years, Asian Paints has clocked a steady volume growth of around 10 per cent. With the company's new premium offerings in the fast-growing exterior paints segment, it is likely to maintain its profitability. Currently, the stock is trading at around 50 times the trailing 12-month earnings, compared to the 10-year median PE of 31.5. It is available at 144 per cent premium to the Nifty index PE. With these high valuations, most analysts are emphasising on caution despite the company's superior fundamentals. Says Shirish Pardeshi, head, research, Anand Rathi Securities: ""Though the company continues to report a healthy earnings growth, we believe most of the upside is capped at current valuations.""


	 


Dabur

The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major, Dabur, enjoys a strong presence in the low-penetration and high-growth categories. It is known for its unique positioning, with a suite comprising products derived from ayurvedic and herbal sources. The company's robust fundamentals have naturally been awarded with premium valuations at all times. The stock has historically traded at a PE of around 37 times, but is currently enjoying a valuation multiple of nearly 57 times the trailing 12-month earnings. This stands at a 173 per cent premium to the Nifty index, almost twice its historical premium of 88 per cent. Despite these high valuations, analysts remain bullish on the stock given the company's strong innovation pipeline and high volume growth. Says Abneesh Roy, analyst at Edelweiss Securities: ""The company is in a sweet spot with volume growth ahead of most peers due to its huge innovation funnel, higher ad spends and aggressive distribution drive.""

HDFC

The first specialised housing finance company in the country, HDFC has enjoyed premium valuations over the years due to its consistent track record in earnings and loan book growth. Across economic cycles, its return ratios have remained healthy, with a return on equity of over 20 per cent in the past 10 years. The company's share price has appreciated recently due to the expectations of a merger with its subsidiary, HDFC Bank. Today, the stock trades at 29 times the earnings, which is not too far from its 10-year median PE of around 27. Its premium over the Nifty is at par with its historical valuation premium.

""At the operating level, HDFC continues to deliver superior performance led by strong growth, steady margins and robust asset quality. However, the stock is trading at a premium valuation and the scope for upside is limited,"" says a report from brokerage firm, Sharekhan. It maintains its 'hold' rating on the stock.

HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank has always held sway over the market, enjoying rich valuations. It has been awarded for its consistent track record of clocking over 30 per cent profit growth. However, it has recently seen the valuations fall from a historical context, after failing to match its own lofty standards of earnings growth. The valuation premium over the Nifty index has narrowed significantly compared to its historical premium. Analysts, however, remain positive on the stock. Says Vaibhav Agrawal, vicepresident, research, Angel Broking:

""Though the current earnings trajectory at over 21 per cent year-on-year is lower than its illustrious track record of over 30 per cent earnings growth, it is still impressive and better than other large private peers in light of the current macro environment. A likely economic recovery would reflect in higher loan growth, which, in our view, justifies a premium valuation multiple.""

Kotak Mahindra Bank

This relative newcomer in the banking space has made a mark for itself with its focus on retail loans. It fetches the highest net interest margins in the industry at 4.5 per cent and boasts a better-than-average asset quality, with its net non-performing assets (NPA) of 1 per cent. It grew its loan book at 25 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past five years. Its high loan book growth, strong management and consistently high return ratios have allowed it to enjoy rich valuations.

At 51 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is trading marginally higher than its his torical multiple and is expensive. Analysts, however, remain bullish because of its all-round superiority. Says Manish Ostwal, analyst, KR Choksey Institutional Research: ""We believe that strong core capitalisation, superior margins and asset quality, improving liability franchise with strong market positioning in capitallinked businesses, are the key differentiators for Kotak.""


	 


Titan Company

Jewellery and watchmaker, Titan, is another company that has always been valued on the higher side. Its dominant position in the organised market, aided by unwavering trust from an upwardly mobile and increasingly brand-conscious Indian middle class, has held the company in good stead all these years. The stock has historically traded at twice the valuation of the broader Nifty index, but is currently trading at a premium of 135 per cent. At a PE of 49 times the trailing 12-month earnings, it is much more expensive than its 10-year median PE of around 39. Yet, analysts are convinced that the stock has enough potential even at these levels. Says Gautam Duggad, analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities: ""We believe that Titan will be a key beneficiary of the improving macro and urban consumer sentiment. The dominant presence in its core segments, underlying shift towards branded segments in both jewellery and watches, and a strong balance sheet make it a compelling play on rising urban aspirations and, therefore, a preference for branded lifestyle goods.""

Apollo Hospitals 

Apollo is India's largest private healthcare service provider, with an integrated business model that offers an umbrella of services. Apart from hospitals, the company has the largest organised pharmacy retail chain, with around 1,600 stores, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of its total revenue. The healthcare services segment has grown at a healthy CAGR of 17 per cent over the past five years on account of incremental hospital addition, as well as expansion and maturity of older hospitals. The pharmacy business has grown at nearly 33 per cent CAGR in the past five years and is also a candidate for possible value unlocking in the future. The consistent growth has allowed the company to fetch premium valuations at all times. At a trailing PE of 46 times, the stock is trading much higher than its historical valuation of around 34.5 times. Analysts say the stock is not providing much comfort at these levels.

Motherson Sumi Systems

This auto component maker has been on an unmatched growth trajectory over the past decade. Even during the troubled years, when its peers struggled, Motherson was able to protect its revenue base and maintain profitability. In the past, it has set very ambitious five-year growth targets for itself and has gone ahead to achieve them.

Having already achieved its revenue target one year in advance, it appears set to meet its target of 40 per cent return on capital employed (ROCE) by 2015. Given such robust fundamentals, analysts continue to back the stock despite a steep PE multiple of 62 times. Says Kaushal Maroo, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services: ""Over the past five years, the Street's focus on nearterm earnings has possibly lead to it missing the bigger picture. The company has emerged from being an Indian wiring harness maker of repute to being a supplier of rear-view mirrors and polymer products to major European original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We see over 30 per cent earnings CAGR during 2013-18.""
The Nifty Fifty era

The craze over high-quality growth stocks has echoes of a bygone era—the US of the 1960s and 70s—when the Nifty Fifty, a basket of 50 popular stocks, enjoyed an obsessive following by investors. These were widely perceived as solid buy-and-hold growth stocks and their lofty valuations were considered well-justified. While these 50 stocks propelled the US bull market of the early 1970s, the subsequent bear market that lasted till 1982 caused valuations of the Nifty Fifty to fall to low levels along with the rest of the market. Most of these stocks underperformed the broader market averages. While many of these are still good performers (Coca-Cola, Gillette, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble), some have lost their way (Polaroid, Eastman Kodak, Dow Chemical). It should serve as a cautionary tale of unrealistic expectations from growth stocks.

Wilmar deal: Not much for Renuka investors,"{""Renuka"": ""neutral"", ""Wilmar"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/wilmar-deal-not-much-for-renuka-investors/articleshow/30757675.cms,m.economictimes.com,Wilmar deal: Not much for Renuka investors,"The proposed deal between Shree Renuka Sugars and Wilmar is certain to disappoint investors, as the stake sale will be at a 10% discount to the current market price. Besides, it will only partially address the company's debt problems.
 
 The Renuka Sugar stock had gained 13.6% in the past four days to Rs 22.5 in anticipation of this deal. Even the proposed open offer price at Rs 21.89 is at a 2.7% discount to the current market price (CMP).
 
 The two-stage deal is expected to help raise Rs 1,240 crore, while the company’s consolidated debt is over Rs 8,700 crore.
 
 “The Brazilian debt is serviced by the Brazilian companies and secured against the assets of those companies. The parent company hasn't given any guarantees towards those loans,” Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugar told ET. The proposed equity infusion will reduce the debt-equity of the standalone parent company from 2.6 to 1, he said.
 
 The two Brazilian subsidiaries jointly have loans close to Rs 5,000 crore. Given this backdrop, the problems related to the company’s stretched balance sheet and huge interest costs may not be addressed swiftly.
 
 The company had reported an operating profit of Rs 1,265 crore for FY13 on a consolidated basis, of which Rs 868 crore went towards servicing its interest payment.
 
 High sugar cane prices and surplus production have resulted in operating losses in Renuka Sugar’s domestic business.
 
 Given the surplus production expected this season, sugar prices are expected to remain flat this year in India. While in spite of a drought in Brazil, the world largest producer, world production may still be above consumption this year. Another concern for the company has been the depreciation in the Brazilian real and Indian rupee, while the company’s significant debt is in dollars. The entire process will take time to consummate due to regulatory issues as well as procedural lag.
 
 An extraordinary general meeting has been convened on March 21 to seek shareholder approval, Murkumbi said that once regulators as well as shareholders approve the deal, the promoters will make an open offer for a 26% stake.
 
 In the second stage, a rights issue will be unveiled to raise Rs 725 crore. Until this entire exercise is over --which could take four to six months -- the company is not expected to secure any benefit either by way of reduced interest costs or operational synergies.
 
 “The deal valuation leaves nothing for the retail shareholders. They are not likely to benefit out of it,” said Nilesh Karani, VP Research, Magnum Broking.
 
 The first phase of the deal, which will entail a preferential allotment of 257.5 million shares to Wilmar, will expand the current equity base of the company by 38%.
 
 This dilution will lower the per share earnings for retail shareholders, whenever the company is back in the black.

Religare's top four picks for 2014,"{""Religare"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/religares-top-four-picks-for-2014/articleshow/28235604.cms,m.economictimes.com,Religare's top four picks for 2014,"NEW DELHI: Indian equities have seen a liquidity-driven rally in 2013, with the Sensex adding 9%, or 1,700 points, and Nifty nearly 7%, or 400 points.
 
 FII inflows were strong during the year and they pumped in more than Rs 1.13 lakh crore into Indian equities.
 
 Elections are the major trigger for 2014 and investors expect that the new government would take strong decisions for the growth, Religare Retail Research said in a note.
 
 The important factors that may affect the stock market in the year 2014 are global and domestic market environment, inflation, interest rate scenario, fiscal/trade scenario in India and policy actions from the next government, among other things, added the report.
 
 Religare is of the view that volatility may continue as the US Fed decision for QE will play a major role. However, the volatility should be used to pick strong fundamental stocks for long term.
 
 The brokerage firm selected following four stocks for the year 2014. It believes the strong growth potential and robust business model of these companies could be rewarding for investors.
 
 
1) Britannia Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1,050
 
 The company expects sustained growth in both bakery and dairy segments in FY14-15. Its growth is expected to be driven via heavy investment in advertising and promotions as well as infrastructure investments, both in the premium and discount segments.
 
 The company expects that it would continue to drive profitable growth in an extremely competitive environment with focus on consumers, customers and cost-effectiveness.
 
 
2) Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd: Target price set at Rs 610
 
 The product pipelines of the company for FY14 are strong and resilient. This fiscal year could witness some more positive action during the second and third quarters as the outlicensing deal with Sanofi could show pleasant progress.
 
 The company has also received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to launch Crofelemer, a drug used for HIV-linked diarrhea. The company is currently preparing to file for approvals to launch this medication in 140 countries.
 
 
3) Jyothi Laboratories Ltd: Target price set at Rs 225
 
 The company has revitalized its flagship brand and also rejigged its detergents portfolio acquired from Henkel. It is likely to launch new products in the personal care space.
 
 To increase awareness of its brands, the company has identified seven power brands that'll be marketed aggressively. Now the company aims to increase its turnover three-fold to Rs 3,000 crore in the next three years.
 
 
4) Rallis India Ltd: Target price set at Rs 210
 
 The company believes that there is a big opportunity in the Indian agrochemical industry as the usage of pesticides in India is one of the lowest in the world with 0.48 kg/ha whereas average world consumption is around 3-5 kg/ha and only 35-40% of the farmland is under crop protection.
 
 The company is strengthening its organic portfolio and focusing on agrochemicals that account for about 85% of its business. It plans to increase its presence in the seeds business and focus on exports.

Reckitt Benckiser names Nitish Kapoor as India MD,"{""Reckitt Benckiser"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/reckitt-benckiser-elevates-india-md-nitish-kapoor-to-global-leadership-role/articleshow/61565898.cms,m.economictimes.com,Reckitt Benckiser elevates India MD Nitish Kapoor to global leadership role,"British consumer goods and healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser has elevated its India managing director Nitish Kapoor into a global leadership role, as part of a sweeping restructuring of operations globally.
 
 Kapoor, who led the India operations for four years and was also RB’s senior vice-president for South Asia, will now head the company’s health business in North America. He will move to the US and report to global chief executive Rakesh Kapoor.
 
 The new structure will be implemented starting the first quarter of 2018.
 
 Under Kapoor, RB India had posted sales of Rs 5,606 crore in fiscal 2016, an expansion of 14% over the previous financial year. Growth was fuelled by improved higher direct distribution in rural markets, introduction of packs at entry-level price points in brands such as Dettol and Harpic, and the ‘Banega Swachh’ campaign to leverage the sanitation brands.
 
 An RB India spokesperson confirmed the development. “RB has reorganised its business, globally, into two units: RB Health and RB Hygiene Home. Nitish Kapoor, currently senior VP South Asia, is moving as executive vice president, RB Health, North America, based in the US.”
 
 RB India will also have two heads — one each for health and hygiene businesses — instead of one overall chief executive.
 
 Gaurav Jain is being appointed as senior vice president Africa, the Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) for RB Health. He will also take charge of the India health business. Narasimhan Eswar is being appointed as senior vice president, South Asia-RB Home Hygiene, and will be looking after the India hygiene home business.
 
 Both executives are internal recruits.
 
 The maker of Dettol soap, Air Wick air freshener and Veet hair remover announced its decision to split its businesses globally last year to sharpen its focus and fuel growth in a challenging market. RB Health is a 7.5 billion pound business.
 
 “RB is embracing bold changes when needed, to continue to create disproportionate shareholder value. The new structure also reinforces the prowess that RB has when it comes to growing diverse talent and building a culture of merit and performance,” said Vibhav Dhawan, managing partner of executive search and consulting firm Positive Moves Consulting.
 
 US baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition, which Reckitt Benckiser acquired for £14.2-billion in June this year, will be part of RB Health. RB Hygiene Home will have brands such as Lysol, Vanish, Finish and Air Wick, and is a five billion pounds business.
 
 In its latest reported earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, RB had reduced its full-year sales outlook, with its net revenue falling 1% to £3.2 billion. The company said it is expecting sales to be flat in the full year, down from a previous target of 2%. RB has struggled with weak sales in recent months, owing to a subdued consumption environment and the Petya ransomware attack earlier this year. The cyber attack had severely impacted the company's ability to make and export products to some markets.

"RBI, bourses weigh dollar delivery in futures trade","{""RBI"": ""neutral"", ""bourses"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/rbi-bourses-weigh-dollar-delivery-in-futures-trade/articleshow/20850701.cms,m.economictimes.com,"RBI, bourses weigh dollar delivery in futures trade","MUMBAI: A choppy rupee is making financial regulators look for ways to cut blind bets in currency futures and make life a little easier for small importers, who have been the worst hit by the rupee’s fall. 

 The Reserve Bank of India and exchanges are exploring the possibility of actual delivery of dollars in bourses where currency futures are traded. At present, futures contracts are cash-settled and do not result in physical delivery of dollars or any other foreign currency. 

 “There are discussions to figure out whether businessmen can be given the choice to take or give dollars. Understandably, exchanges will have to tie up with banks that can arrange the dollars,” said an official familiar with the proposal. 

 Many perceive that hedging – or covering the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations – can be less expensive in an exchange than buying or selling forward dollars with a bank in the regular and much larger OTC exchange. 

 In a currency futures exchange, a small firm as well as a large corporate are offered the same rate, unlike in the less transparent OTC market where a bank may quote a better rate to a large corporate that generates other businesses. “Also, if a section of the market prefers physical dollar delivery, the degree of naked speculation would come down… But one doesn’t know whether this would make the rupee stable or the absence of alarge number of speculators would bring down liquidity in certain contracts,” said a currency trader. 

 Unlike the OTC market where a forward position can be taken only against a real undertaking (like export receivable or import payable), positions in currency futures require no such underlying. What may have kept away many small companies from currency futures is the need to monitor their margins with the intermediary on a daily basis and the compulsion to replenish margins if the market goes against it. 

 The proposal (to allow delivery and physical settlement in dollars) crops up at a time the central bank has to take a call on whether foreign institutional investors (FII) should be allowed to trade in currency futures. After the recent drop in the rupee, the regulator has to think through the subject. The entry of FIIs in currency futures could shift billions of dollars of trades on the rupee that currently happen in offshore markets like Singapore and London, to India. Even though RBI never openly admits the existence of such markets, it’s fully aware of their activities and even takes steps to minimize chances of volatility in the offshore market boiling over to the Indian foreign exchange market. 

 Currency has always been a touchy issue for RBI, which hunts for ways to reduce volatility whenever the rupee is under pressure. A year ago it restrained banks from covering their OTC positions in the currency futures exchange. In other words, a buy or sell position in OTC can be reversed or sold in OTC itself (and not in currency exchanges). 

 “Allowing FIIs to hedge in currency futures along with allowing companies to take delivery of foreign currency in exchanges may be a good idea. But in such times RBI has to decide carefully,” said a banker.

RBI Deputy Governor Anand Sinha retires,"{""RBI"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/rbi-deputy-governor-anand-sinha-retires/articleshow/29122013.cms,m.economictimes.com,RBI Deputy Governor Anand Sinha retires,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Anand Sinha, who was looking after the new bank licence process has retired, even as procedure of granting licences to the private sector is yet to be completed. 

 His portfolio has been allocated to other three Deputy Governors. 

 It is also believed that Sinha will be appointed as an adviser to the central bank for a period of three months so that his expertise can be utilised for shortlisting of applicants for bank licences. 

 Initially, 26 entities evinced interest in entering the banking arena. Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group, withdrew its application in November, leaving 25 players in the fray. 

 Public sector units India Post and IFCI, private sector Anil Ambani group and Aditya Birla group submitted applications on July 1. Besides, Bajaj Finance, Muthoot Finance, Religare Enterprises and Shriram Capital have applied for licences. 

 The Finance Minister and RBI Governor at several occasions had said that bank licences to corporates would be granted by the end of current fiscal. 

 ""I hope to announce the licences within, or soon after, the term of Deputy Governor Anand Sinha who has been shepherding the process. His term expires January 2014,"" RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had said in his first media briefing after taking charge from D Subbarao. 

 RBI in a statement said the portfolios are allocated among three other Deputy Governors-- K C Chakrabarty, H R Khan and Urjit Patel. 

 ""The RBI has reallocated the portfolios among the three Deputy Governors from Monday, January 20, 2014. The reallocation was necessitated consequent upon Anand Sinha relinquishing his charge as Deputy Governor,"" RBI said in a release. 

 Sinha was reappointed as the Deputy Governor of RBI for 11 months till January 18, 2014 in February last year. 

 He looked after the Department of Banking Operations and Development, the Department of Non-Banking Supervision and the Urban Banks Department, Departments of Risk Monitoring, Information Technology, Expenditure and Budgetary Control, Legal and Premises. 

 K C Chakrabarty has been given additional portfolio of Legal and Premises Department, Urban Banks Department. 

 H R Khan will get additional charge of Department of Banking Operations and Development, Department of Non-Banking Supervision and Urban Banks Department and Department of Information Technology. 

 While Urjit Patel gets the Department of Expenditure & Budgetary Control and Risk Monitoring as additional portfolios. 

 RBI said that the portfolio will be reallocated upon appointment of a new Deputy Governor.

Overall, this rebalancing has proceeded on a pre-announced glide path and has evolved satisfactorily,” the RBI said through a press release on its website.

The central bank said that it would carry on rebalancing liquidity conditions in a non-disruptive manner while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the productive sectors of the economy. ""With larger than anticipated collections under the goods and services tax (GST), system liquidity has tightened in this week,"" it said.

After a long hiatus, the RBI announced and conducted a variable rate repo auction as overnight money market rates had hardened this week due to larger-than-anticipated collections under the goods and services tax.

The overnight variable rate repo auction, which had a notified amount of Rs 50,000 crore, drew bids worth Rs 65,700 crore, with the cutoff rate being set at 4.06 per cent. The weighted average rate was 4.10 per cent.

In a repo operation, the central bank lends out funds to banks in exchange for government securities.

In the December monetary policy review, the central bank had said that it aims to make the 14-day variable rate reverse repo auction, the primary route for liquidity absorption.

Following large-scale liquidity infusions by the central bank amid the coronavirus pandemic, liquidity in the banking system has swollen to record highs, with the surplus estimated at around Rs 7 lakh crores last week.

The central bank’s efforts to nudge banks to park funds at longer-tenure variable rate reverse repo auctions have not always met with success though, with some such auctions seeing poor participation as banks were averse to lending out cash for longer periods.

Some market participants have also questioned the efficacy of the step, given that a significant portion of the liquidity surplus rests on the books of mutual funds, which are not permitted access to the RBI’s reverse repo window.

Managing liquidity conditions in the banking system is a tricky job for the RBI at the moment as inflation in India remains well above the central bank’s own targets, while central banks in advanced economies are progressively moving towards tighter monetary policies.

Even as economic growth still requires much support amid the COVID pandemic, it seems a foregone conclusion that the RBI will have to proactively tackle the liquidity surplus in the banking system and consider raising interest rates to be in sync with both global and domestic inflationary developments.

Raw material bull market fades as supply expands,"{""Raw material"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/raw-material-bull-market-fades-as-supply-expands/articleshow/19353111.cms,m.economictimes.com,Raw material bull market fades as supply expands,"LONDON: At a time when US equities are trading near a record and the dollar is having its best start in three years, commodities will finish this quarter little changed from where they were at the end of 2012. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials will be at 644 at the end of June, 1.2% lower than now, according to the median of nine investor and analyst predictions compiled by Bloomberg. The index rose 0.8% this year, the worst start since 2003. 

 Arabica coffee, silver and nickel will gain as cotton, crude and natural gas fall, analyst forecasts show. Investors had $132 billion tracking commodity indexes in February, Barclays estimates. Supplies of everything from copper to sugar to oil are now catching up with or exceeding demand after the S&P GSCI's almost fourfold advance since the end of 2001 spurred new mines, wells and crop acreage. 

 While the International Monetary Fund expects global economic growth to accelerate to 3.5% this year, from 3.2% in 2012, the Washington-based group cut its estimate three times since July. The 17-nation euro area already tumbled back into its second recession in three years. 

 ""No one is really concerned we're going to have any shortages,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, the Toronto-based company ranked by Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster on Brent oil and third-best in industrial metals over the past two years. 

 ""The big complaint is the inventories are probably a bit too high. It's difficult for us, given the supply configurations across the commodity spectrum, to say that we're going to see a lot of upside."" 

 The S&P GSCI beat the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities, the US Dollar Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index of bonds in six of the past 11 years. Commodities entered a bull market in August as the worst US drought since the 1930s drove crop prices to records and oil rallied. The gauge retreated about 4% since then and ended 2012 at 646.58. 

 Nine of the 24 items in the S&P GSCI are in bear markets, having declined at least 20% from their recent highs. They account for less than 17% of the index weightings, with New York oil, gasoil and heating oil still in bull markets. Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks fell 24% to $6 billion last year, the first drop since at least 2008, according to Coalition, an analytics company. Goldman Sachs ranked first in 2012, followed by JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, the London-based group estimates. 

 Smaller price swings may be curbing profit. The 100-day measure of volatility in the S&P GSCI dropped to 11.5 on March 18, the lowest since 1996, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The commodities supercycle, or longer-than-average period of rising prices, is over, Citigroup said in a November report. 

 China, the biggest user of everything from copper to cotton to coal, is slowing and years of higher prices encouraged more supply, the bank said. The retreat in raw materials in February reinforced that view, Ed Morse, the global head of commodities research in New York, said in an e-mail March 25.

  Deepak Mohoni, Director, trendwatchindia.com, in a chat with ET Now, gives his call on Ranbaxy
  
  
  
  What do you think about Ranbaxy?
  
  Ranbaxy is pretty much a day trading and a short term buying idea. Not all pharmas are defensive, Ranbaxy is not a defensive pharma but every now and then it will make a pretty good move and it is doing exactly that. Short side, this is there only if the market starts going down. There is no point shorting in a rising market but we often have this 11 o’clock or a little bit later a reversal in the market. If that comes today, then a good short sale for intraday traders would be OnMobile Global, that is not doing much yet today and it has done pretty poorly in the last few weeks.

  Vinith Jain, Director, Siddh Capital in an interview with ET Now talks about Ramsarup.
  
  
  What’s your call on the steel companies? How do you view Ramsarup?
  
  The BSE metal index has been a poor performer in the recent past. The index faces a strong resistance around 15700 and even in the last three weeks, we see that the index has turned from 15250 around, so a pullback rally could maximum do up to 15500 or 15700. 
  
  On Ramsarup, I see the stock has been trending between 70 and 90 for quite sometime now and the upside is capped at 90, so unless it breaks above that, very little to take on the stock.

 ""We are also evaluating how to make entry into the export markets,"" said KR Venkatadri, chief operating officer, Rallis India. The company had launched its branded grapes towards the end of the season last year.

 Vekatadri was speaking after the launch of AMPLUS and AMPLUS Active, a microbial bio-product, which helps enhance the soil fertility. The products are from Norway-headquartered Agrinos, which has partnered with Rallis for marketing them in India. 

 DR Wagner, chief executive officer of Agrinos AS, said: ""About 30% of the world soils are degraded. When we launched this product in Texas in 2013 on 0.5% of the sugarcane crop, its usage increased to 10% of the total area under sugarcane the next year.""

Stay with quality stocks: Deven Choksey,"{""quality stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/expert-view/be-realistic-sit-on-cash-and-accumulate-good-quality-stocks-deven-choksey/articleshow/69938554.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Be realistic, sit on cash and accumulate good quality stocks: Deven Choksey","Some of the midcap and largecap stocks are becoming attractive now and one will have to start looking at them with an investment horizon of one year and above, says Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. 
Is it time to put money to work or is this the time where you need to clean up whatever you can get?The obvious view point here is that you sit tight in a situation like this and stay with good quality stocks in your portfolio. Some of the good quality stocks have also fallen and it is going to test your patience. We are observing that the market takes time to reward good quality stocks but they keep getting rewarded in subsequent period of time also. 
 
Today there is a situation of fear in the marketplace. People are unsure about where exactly some of the banks or the NBFC problem could hurt or hit some genuine companies in respective space. That is where we are telling people to stay with good quality promoters and the companies. Some of the stocks in the midcap and even in the largecap space are becoming attractive now and one should start looking at them with an investment horizon of one year and above. 
 
This fear factor will recede at some point of time and that is where we will find value in some of the good quality investment stocks which can reward you eventually. It is time to remain a little bit cautious. That does not mean one should be a pessimist. This country and economy offer huge opportunities. So do not be pessimistic. One should be realistic and sit on cash for some time and accumulate good quality stocks.


Will you be a buyer in Emami because the supply promoter overhang is clearly over?One sensible thing which is happening is the promoter group is basically paying off their debt and whichever way they are paying off, it is a good thing to observe. The second most important thing and that is where I would like to see the direction coming from Indian promoters. They are probably spread too thin in too many areas of business. At a promoter level, you should have a journey in some select areas and try and make the size as your destination. 
 
Many of the promoters have spread into too many businesses and that is going to be a problem area for them. The sooner those promoter groups consolidate and stay focussed, where they can register their mark by becoming a right size company I guess would be the one thing to look at. 
 
As of now, we do not get that kind of a signal from any of the promoter groups including Emami and that is where discomfort would be since they are spread too thin, It is not the time to look at them even though they may be correcting their past and bringing capital back to give shareholders relative comfort. I would like to see a clear focus on a select group of businesses and not too many areas. 
 

Earnings are not there generally and good quality stocks are super expensive. The slowdown in the consumer space is a reality and the delayed monsoon could create further stress on the agrarian economy. It clearly appears that for next 6, 8, 10 months, this market is gone.There are concerns over some of the factors which you have mentioned. Monsoon is definitely a concern. In next two-three months, we hope to get good rains and that is how we would probably remain relatively more confident going forward. 
 
As far as the consumption space is concerned, the solution lies in bringing down the rate of interest. Today for a variety of reasons, the banks and institutions have not been able to bring down the rate of interest. May be the argument going forward would be that can the country bring differential rate of interest wherein on one side you have the infrastructure projects which needs investment but which are not investing because of the high cost of funds. On the other side, the consumer wants to spend again and needs to know where to put his money at a lower cost of funds. This is a situation where a differential rate of interest could help relatively better investment on the consumption side as well as on the infrastructure spending side. 
 
What is common for both the sectors is that if an increase in spending takes place, then that may lead to revival in the economy or growth in corporate sector earnings. So, one is going to influence the other. Lower cost of interest will influence the higher rate of growth and that is where one would like to argue for bringing down the rate of interest. How soon, how fast will depend on the actions from the government side.

Puravankara Projects gives 70% dividend to non-promoters,"{""Puravankara Projects"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/puravankara-projects-gives-70-dividend-to-non-promoters/articleshow/19605259.cms,m.economictimes.com,Puravankara Projects gives 70% dividend to non-promoters,"MUMBAI: Bangalore-based real estate developer Puravankara Projects is wooing shareholders with a handsome 70% dividend ahead of its share sale through an institutional placement programme (IPP) next month. Purvankara will spend close to Rs 75 crore dolling out dividend to its shareholders, while the promoters will take home only Rs 19.19 crore as 20% dividend. 

 The public shareholding in Purvankara is 9.04% while the promoters hold 89.96%, which they have to cut to 75% to satisfy Sebi's minimum public share holding norms. Investment banker JP Morgan has the mandate and Purvankara will sell shares through an IPP for around Rs 110 apiece, said a source involved with the deal. Puravankara has a m-cap of Rs 2,245 crore based on Wednesday's closing price on BSE. 

 Each Puravankara share has a face value of Rs 5 and public shareholders will get a dividend of Rs 3.5 per share. This makes it a dividend yield of 3.5% for shareholders of Puravankara based on closing the closing share price of Tuesday. The share price rose by 7% to close at Rs 105.2 on Wednesday after it declared the dividend. 

 Among real estate companies with a market-cap more than Rs 100 crore, only Kolte Patil Developers, at 4.11%, based on its last declared dividend, has a dividend yield higher than Puravankara. 

 ""The move raises the bar for corporate governance at a time minority shareholders feel short-changed every now and then. Real estate companies like DLF, Unitech and HDIL are unable to service their debt. Any such gesture by a company gives a good signal to the market,"" said an analyst of a Mumbai-based brokerage. 

 ""Giving a higher dividend to non-promoters is good for existing shareholders of the company but prospective shareholders should also look at various other parameters before investing,"" said Phani Shekhar, fund manager at Angel Broking. He said Purvankara's project execution was better than many of its peers and even its debt pile was less than peers like DLF and HDIL, among others.

PSU bonds match equity returns in fourth quarter,"{""PSU bonds"": ""neutral"", ""equity"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/psu-bonds-match-equity-returns-in-fourth-quarter/articleshow/33196481.cms,m.economictimes.com,PSU bonds match equity returns in fourth quarter,"MUMBAI: All eyes might be on equities but tax-free bonds offered by state-owned companies in the January-March period have silently returned close to stock market gains. Investors have seen between 4% and 7% capital appreciation in their investment within this short span of time.
 
 Towards the end of the financial year, public sector issuers such as NTPC, National Housing Bank (NHB) and Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC) to name a few brought a series of public issuances offering between 8% and 9% coupon broadly for 10,15 and 20 years. “Those bonds offer very attractive rates over a long period,” said Suresh Sadagopan, principal planner, Ladder 7 Financial, an advisory firm.
 
 “Perhaps, we are going through the peak of interest rates. Even if there is capital appreciation, retail investors should hold it till maturity for higher long-term returns.” For example, a particular series of NHB bonds which were issued at a face value of Rs 5,000 per bond during the March quarter on Thursday quoted the last trading price of Rs 5,321 in the secondary market, suggesting a capital appreciation of 6.4%.
 
 Similarly, NHPC bonds rose to an intraday high of Rs 1,072 compared with a face value of Rs 1,000, an appreciation of more than 7%. The 30-share BSE Sensex has moved up 8% in the last three months. Even though a comparison between equity and debt may not be justified as they are two different asset classes, an investor with less risk appetite can earn good returns in bonds.
 
 In its first bi-monthly policy, the Reserve Bank of India hinted at keeping interest rates unchanged till the time the central bank attains 8% retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index, or CPI. If the rate of inflation keeps falling, there are rate cut chances, which may begin in 2015. As the country achieves higher pace of growth with falling inflation, interest rates may be cut.
 
 Most of those issuers were AAA-rated, barring HUDCO, which was assigned AA+, one notch lower. But, the government ownership is the key trigger that makes all these a safe investment bet.
 
 “It does not make sense for investors to exit investments booking profit at this point unless there is a compulsion,” said Amit Kukreja, founder of WealthBeing Advisors. “In case of selling, investors will attract shortterm capital gain tax as per individual income tax slab, which, in turn, will erode absolute returns.”

"Neutral on power sector: Pankaj Pandey, ICICI Direct","{""power sector"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/neutral-on-power-sector-pankaj-pandey-icici-direct/articleshow/8440357.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,"Neutral on power sector: Pankaj Pandey, ICICI Direct","
  Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICI Direct, in a chat with ET Now, talks about the power sector
   
  
  
  What are your views on the power sector?
  
  In terms of stock if you look at power as a sector, we are neutral, and our top pick is NTPC with a target price of Rs 202. We had a sell call on Neyveli Lignite earlier, and the stock has corrected and roundabout Rs 100 levels, it becomes a hold. The best part is that the company has all fully depreciated plants but then again going forward, the growth visibility is still lacking because the capex is still not happening as it should have been because of which we had a sell rating. Probably we will look at this stock afresh post this announcement but I do not think we are very bullish on the power sector as a whole for the next 12 months. We prefer NTPC because it has got a little far lesser fuel risk compared to some of the other players, which are banking on merchant or the regulated ones also.

Participate in power through other sectors: Vijai Mantri,"{""power"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/participate-in-power-through-other-sectors-vijai-mantri/articleshow/35506198.cms,m.economictimes.com,Participate in power through other sectors: Vijai Mantri,"In a chat with ET Now, Vijai Mantri, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Pramerica Mutual Fund shares his views on Power companies. 

 
ET Now: Let us talk about power as a group. Now the power index only in the month of May has appreciated by about 30%. Some part of the price action in power stocks could be mean reversion but nothing will change for Indian power sector in next six months, next 12 months because there is still no fuel supply, plant load factors are at a historic low and most of the power companies have broken balance sheets. So do you think somewhere power stocks are now not only running but running way ahead of their fundamentals? 

 
Vijai Mantri: It is very difficult to pinpoint on the power sector because many companies are new and they do not have a robust business model. So it is not necessary that you have to participate in the power sector by investing only in the power companies. You could participate in that either by investing in the capital goods companies or the banking stocks or NBFCs. If you look at the track record of Narendra Modi in Gujarat, he has increased the power capacity in the state by multiple times and he assured people that you will see 24 power power supply coming in your household. So very clearly what are the bottlenecks you have seen and most of them are linked with the few linkages and the policy related, that will be ironed out over a period of time. So the kind of hammering these stocks have gone through, 30% in my opinion is too less. Most of the stocks are down by 80% to 90% from the historical high. So you will see more gain coming out from the power sector but if you want to see visibility of the earnings coming, then it is not necessary that you have to participate only through power sector, you can participate in the same story through other sectors as well.

The issue price looks a little expensive, but the company’s order book, balance sheet and prospects offer future revenue visibility. Business PNC Infratech is a medium-sized road construction company. It has an order book ofRs 3,444 crore, which is nearly three times its construction revenues in FY14.
 
 Of this, nearly half of the order book is to be executed in FY16, while the balance in FY17 and FY18. This provides a good revenue visibility for the next few quarters for the company. In addition to this, PNC Infra has seven projects on Build Operate Transfer (or BOT) basis, out of which three are operational. The company has also diversified into construction of airport runway, dedicated freight corridor and power transmission projects.

 The twelfth five-year plan entails an investment of nearly Rs 9 lakh crore which is more than two times the previous five-year plan investments.
 
 Besides this, the government's focus on awarding future roads projects primarily through Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) route in the next few years augurs well for companies like PNC Infra.

There are fundamental factors, besides rupee, influencing the industry's growth in the short to medium-term. Drug companies' performance stands impacted by these factors in the coming quarters:
 
 1. Pace of Drug Approvals in the US has picked up, clearing the way for companies to launch more products in the US. Companies like Lupin, Aurobindo and Glenmark have received a series of approvals in the recent months.
 
 2. Punitive Regulatory Action by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) remains a potential risk, dimming the exports prospects of the company facing the clamps. Sun Pharma and Ipca Labs continue to work towards attaining full regulatory compliance.
 
 

 
 3. Customer Consolidation in the US is changing the existing equation for Indian drug sellers. A handful of retailers control most of the purchasing of generic drugs. Companies like Dr Reddy's and Lupin have faced price erosion in the US on this account.
 
 4. Volumes Growth in Domestic Market has been on a recovery, auguring well for companies with leading presence in the local market. Companies like Astrazeneca Pharma, Glenmark and Torrent have outperformed the rest in recent months.
 
 5. Price Control in the domestic market remains a sore point, especially if prices of more drugs are brought under the control regime.
 
 6. MNCs in India have become aggressive in launching products in the domestic market.
 
 7. The growth of MNCs have outpaced that of the Indian companies in the last two months.
 
 Emerging Markets: While performance of Indian companies is steadily improving in most emerging markets, the currency depreciation remains a concern eclipsing the overall performance.
 
 8. M&As continue to be a game changer as firms acquire targets and brands in India and outside.

Seven rules for investing in penny stocks,"{""penny stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/seven-rules-for-investing-in-penny-stocks/articleshow/48305040.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Seven rules for investing in penny stocks,"Despite the risks, small investors are putting big money in low-priced penny stocks. They are lured by the fantastic returns that some stocks have delivered in the past few months. If you also want to invest in this risky segment of the market, keep a few rules in mind.
 
 
1. Don’t invest large amounts
 
 Don’t lean too much on these risky investments. Penny stocks should not account for more than 10% of your total equity portfolio. This means if your total investment portfolio is Rs 20 lakh and 30% (or Rs 6 lakh) is in stocks, then the maximum you should put in these high-risk stocks is Rs 60,000. Invest only what you can afford to lose.
 
 
2. Invest only in 2-3 stocks
 
 The principle of diversification does not work here. Instead of picking up a large number of penny stocks, invest in only a handful of scrips. Spreading your money across a basket of low-priced stocks will not let you earn meaningful returns from them.
 
 If you have Rs 3,000 invested in a stock and it gives a return of 25% in a month, the gain will be an insignificant Rs 750. Besides, it is easier to monitor 2-3 stocks rather than a portfolio of 10-15 low priced stocks.
 
 
3. Don’t invest and forget
 
 Investing in penny stocks should be seen as a short-term gambit, not a long-term strategy. If the stock witnesses a sharp rise, it may be time to exit or at least book partial profits. Some investors might think that if they wait for a year, the gains will be tax free. But the stock may have fallen by then. Set a target and exit when it is achieved. Don’t hold penny stocks forever.
 
 
4. Don’t believe anyone
 
 The online forums of financial portals are awash with advice and information on penny stocks. Don’t believe a word of what other investors have to offer. In this segment, everybody is in search of the greater fool who will pay a higher price for the junk in their portfolio. Also, take the claims of the management with a pinch of salt. They usually paint a rosy picture.
 
 
5. Buy stocks with high volumes
 
 Some penny stocks are very thinly traded. For instance, the average daily volume of Titan Securities for the past 1 month has been only 3 shares. So if you have 5,000 shares of the company, it will be quite difficult to offload them when you want to exit the stock. Buy stocks that have reasonably high trading volumes so that there is ample liquidity. Don’t look only at one day’s trading but consider the monthly average.
 
 
6. Don’t try to average your purchases
 
 If you bought a share at Rs 6 and it is now trading at Rs 3, don’t try to average out your purchase by buying more of it. You may end up digging a bigger hole for yourself and lose more money. Don’t get anchored to a price and be ready to book losses if an investment goes wrong. You should improve the average by selling some shares when the price starts moving up, rather than buying more when it goes down.
 
 
7. Never let success change your strategy
 
 They say the four most dangerous words in the market are “It’s different this time”. Investors who make early gains tend to get carried away by overconfidence and start making mistakes. Do not forget the six rules of investing given above if you don’t want to lose your shirt in this market.

  NEW DELHI: A government panel has selected India’s largest energy explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) director-offshore Sudhir Vasudeva to head the state-run company after incumbent RS Sharma retires on January 31 next year. 
  
  The Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB), the committee that screens talent for top positions in state-run companies, named Mr Vasudeva, 56, as its first choice after interviewing eight candidates on Tuesday, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
  
  The board has named Pawan Hans Ltd chairman & managing director RK Tyagi as its second choice for the post of chairman & managing director of ONGC. 
  
  The panel’s recommendation will be sent to the appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC), which will take a final call, one of them said. Mr Vasudeva has been actively involved for about 19 years in development and management of the Mumbai High, India’s prime oil asset. He had was involved with the producing oil field of ONGC between 1979 and 1990 and again between 2000 and 2008. He used innovative technology to arrest the declining output from the ageing field.

Experts' call on oil marketing companies,"{""oil marketing companies"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/investors-appetite-for-oil-marketing-companies-unlikely-to-pick-up/articleshow/94821853.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Investors' appetite for oil marketing companies unlikely to pick up,"Mumbai: Investor appetite for oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum may remain muted despite the government's relief package to these firms to make up for the subsidy losses. Analysts are advising against buying shares of these companies as they are expected to remain under pressure until global crude prices decline further and the rupee stabilises.

The government on Wednesday said it has approved a one-time grant of ₹22,000 crore to these PSUs for selling liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or cooking gas at prices below market. OMC shares, which have drifted lower in recent months, edged 1-3% higher earlier in Wednesday's session but the gains fizzled out soon.
""OMCs will continue the downward trend,"" said Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities. ""We expected a temporary bounce that could be used to book profit but there are no signs of bottom reversal in these stocks.""
 
IOC shares, which advanced as much as 2.8%, closed at ₹67.30 apiece, up 2.05%. The stock has a crucial support at ₹65, breaching it could take the stock down to ₹61-62 levels, said Shetti.

BPCL gained 1% to end at ₹302.65, while HPCL surrendered all its gains to end marginally in the red at ₹210.15.

HPCL shares may find support around ₹206, and breaking that would take it down to ₹197, a downside of 6.2% from the current levels, said Shetti. BPCL may find support around ₹285 and breaching it would take the stock around ₹275-276 levels, down about 9%, he said.

""The only thing that can change the negative outlook on OMCs is if crude oil prices ease to $70-80 a barrel,"" said Swarnendu Bhushan, vice president, research - oil and gas, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. ""Due to elevated crude oil prices, OMCs generated steep losses on petrol and diesel. The talks of subsidy packages may not be sufficient to cover the losses incurred in the previous quarter.""

Brent crude prices have surged more than 20% to around $94 per barrel so far this year on account of the Russia-Ukraine war. It spiked to as high as $139.13 earlier this year due to the supply crunch after the US and western European nations imposed sanctions on Russia, world's third-largest producer of oil. Since January, shares of IOC, BPCL and HPCL have lost 11-29% on the back of weak auto fuel marketing margins and a steep fall in refining margins.

Besides the increases in crude prices, the Indian economy is facing a double-whammy due to the sharp declines in the rupee against the dollar. 

On Monday, the rupee fell to its all-time low of 82.68 to a dollar, down 10.5% since January.

New York's main contract, light sweet crude for April delivery, rose 11 cents to 40.07 dollars a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 23 cents to 42.27. ""The markets are sort of still in search of indicators for demand and whether OPEC cuts are going to hold in the long run and support prices,"" said Jason Feer, Asia Pacific vice-president for energy market analysts Argus Media Ltd.

Barclays Capital said in a report Tuesday that the oil market was currently facing ""something of a hiatus,"" marked by macroeconomic uncertainty and lack of any definitive direction in the flow of market data. The New York price, slightly lower in early Asian trade Wednesday, rose slightly as US President Barack Obama made his debut address to a joint session of Congress. In a blizzard of proposals, programmes and reforms, the president demanded an overhaul of financial regulation and warned he may need more than the 700 billion dollars already earmarked to save the debt-riddled finance industry. ""Demand concerns remain prevalent on the energy markets, so the upside continues to be limited and we could be in for more sideways trading,"" said Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital. "

 The platform was launched by Finance Minister P Chidambaram, along with Sebi Chairman U K Sinha, with the listing of Thejo Engineering -- the first company to get listed in NSE's Emerge segment. 

 Talking to reporters after the launch, NSE Managing Director Ravi Narain said that the exchange has been very careful in brining in only good-quality companies on the platform and there was ""quite a decent number of companies"" interested in getting listed. 

 He, however, did not divulge the exact number of the companies that NSE expects on the Emerge platform. 

 ""NSE would provide all the required hand-holding to the companies interested in getting listed on Emerge,"" NSE's Joint Managing Director Chitra Ramkrishna said. 

 Narain said the turnover was expected to remain modest on the platform initially and it was not driven by a revenue- earning model. 

 However, the platform would help in developing the eco- system and provide the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) a much-needed avenue to raise capital from the equity market. 

 ""At times, it is difficult for these small companies to get credit, but here we are talking about helping them get the equity risk capital,"" he said. 

 Narain, however, said that the Emerge platform was very different from London Stock Exchange's AIM platform, as there have been no relaxations in regulatory framework for such segments in India. 

 Asked about the competition from BSE, whose SME platform has already got seven listed companies, Narain said that the NSE would bring in innovation to its model. 

 ""Beyond the capital market Sebi's requirements, we have added two more things -- voluntary rating and voluntary due diligence -- for the companies desiring to get listed on Emerge,"" he said. 

 Ramkrishna said, meanwhile, that the exchange would also put out research reports about the Emerge-listed companies on its website for the benefit of the investors. 

 The platform would seek to safeguard the interest of the companies, investors as well as market intermediaries, she said. 

 Companies would get the option for trading in continuous market, or through call-auction mechanism.

  We have kept in very close to the last market top that was 5400 and a bit and today’s reaction, though it’s over 100, it is nevertheless in keeping with little bit of a global reaction. So at the moment there is nothing very alarming about it. It has to see whether it gains downward momentum from here, that’s the only look out. If we see the market bouncing back again tomorrow and day after, that means the uptrend is still very much in that.

5450-5500 is possible on Nifty: Aptart Technical Services,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/5450-5500-is-possible-on-nifty-aptart-technical-services/articleshow/5423151.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,5450-5500 is possible on Nifty: Aptart Technical Services ,"Sandeep Wagle, Founder & MD, Aptart Technical Services in an interview with ET Now says that 5450-5500 is possible on Nifty.One word on the Nifty. What is the sense on the last day of the week?We have been saying this for the last two weeks. 5280-5300 is a correction, that is a resistance point. Nifty has moved up one way from 4950 to 5250-5300. So a fall of 50-100 points in fact is not yet corrected. I would expect another 50 to 100 points and that would be also fine and the move should start. The bulls are not willing to let go and the action is totally focussed on midcaps.The market is looking for fresh triggers and ahead of Q3 earnings, you think that is factored in already or what is the support levels we are working with?I would say that is being factored in. I would not say it is already factored in because we are talking of 5400-5450 on the Nifty. So some element of some sideways move before that move begins. 5450-5500 is also possible, that is around 7-8% from current levels. So if the Nifty takes some time, indices take some time here where individual stocks moving up. Reliance has already started, so maybe the front liners may follow in the next couple of days or weeks, that is healthy for the markets outside.There was a bit of a pressure on IT index yesterday. Do you think they have ability to bounce back because the ADRs have not been too bad?The fall or the correction - whatever you call it - is almost over and I am specifically talking of IT and it had already run up ahead of the market. So that was very much due. This is a time if one has sold it at higher levels book profits, it is time to start entering again. Auto looks a little weak, possibly that can drag the indices to some level, another 50-70 points whatever if it happens but IT yes, we are near intermediate bottom.But any favourites or anything that you would take off the table from IT?I would go with the front liners, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, that would be my best bets and midcaps of course that will normally follow, front liners normally lead and then midcaps outperform. So at this point of time, front liners, they have corrected a bit, they may correct in a small way, that is the time to buy.One stock that was really active yesterday, Aban Offshore, what is the rationale, what is the target price?Aban has a typical behaviour pattern in terms of the way it moves. When the move starts, it continues. If you have seen the past previous rise that has happened in Aban or even the correction, yesterday it has started the move and we have a buy in Aban between 1443 and 1410. It will not correct in a big way. We have a stop loss of 1390 and a target of 1575, we are looking at around 8% to 10% upside move. This could happen in the next 8 to 10 trading sessions.Arvind Mills, showed a bit of an uptick yesterday, 8% to 9%. At current levels would you buy and what is the target?Yes, we have a buy in Arvind. In fact Arvind and Alok both are showing a very similar pattern but this is for a quick trade talk of the next one week, 8 to 10 trading sessions. Being a small cap but you cannot count the returns in percentage. We have a target of around 49 to 50 which comes out to 15% to 20% and this should come in in the next possibly 8 to 10 trading sessions, very very clear breakout, highest volumes in the last two to three months. So that volume itself will have the momentum to push the stock upward by another 15-20%, the target being 50.Have you looked at the sugar stocks?Yes but I feel a little uncomfortable. I have been saying for the last three days, Renuka in the short term is very positive and Bajaj Hindusthan, the weekly pattern is phenomenal. Having said that, I do not say the move will start now. It can consolidate over the next two-three weeks and the move may begin. It all depends on how the Nifty pans out. If the Nifty is at 5450-5500 in the next two to three weeks, Bajaj Hindusthan will be the stock to watch.You have been looking at some strong leadership coming in from the oil and gas space. We have been looking at Aban, a lot of interest building up there. Essar Oil, another counter that clocked a pretty smart turnover in yesterday’s trade.Yes, Essar Oil has given a very clear breakout, volumes have been phenomenal over the last two to three days and it is heading for somewhere around 175-180 - that is the immediate target. If one can take a little longer view, six to eight weeks possibly, one can look at a target of even 190-195 which is our 20-25% return. This is a stock to be bought on every decline in the range of 160 to 150, a stop loss of 145.Reliance Industries yesterday closed trade above 1100. Would you buy the stock this morning given the news?I would buy this stock somewhere around 1040-1050 and I would be looking at booking profits around 1140. In short term - possibly a few weeks - I am looking at this stock in the range of 1050-1150-1140. So if one is trading for Rs 30-40 as a trader, yes I see that much upside. Beyond that I do not see it immediately because if it takes out 1150 and holds above that then the next target in Reliance could be somewhere around 1300. Frankly, I do not see that much momentum in the short term at least for the next two to three weeks. Having said that, I am not bearish also, so I would talk of range bound movement. So I will not buy at this point of time.What about Motilal Oswal Financial Services and IFCI. Is IFCI interesting to go?Not really, short term yes, possibly 7-8-10%, nothing more than that. I do not have a very clear pattern which suggests the bigger move than that but it is not weak also.So what would be your recommendation right now, avoid IFCI?I would say avoid IFCI.What about Motilal Oswal?Similar pattern. Stocks are coming out of a move. So I see a 10 to 12% upside move in all of the stocks, nothing beyond that.What is your sense in the midcap banking space? Dena Bank is looking extremely strong. Do you think there is more upside there for it?A lot of analysts have recommended Dena Bank in the last two-three days. I would say that Dena Bank once above 95, it is coming out a big rounding bottom pattern and I see a very very big move. It can go to around 140-150. But again, having said that, this is probably a three to six-month view. So I do not expect Dena Bank to just surge one way. If one has to take a long term call then I would buy Dena Bank on every decline or on breakout above 95. The target can be really big somewhere around 140-150.What about Cairn India or JP Hydro, have you looked at the charts?JP Hydro was one stock which I had recommended earlier. The move has started. I see a immediate target of 90-92 and possibly the next target is 95-96. So a very clear 10-12% up move. If you talk of Cairn, one is late because the breakout came around 293. Currently it is at around 308 and I see a move up to 314-315. So financially it may not make great sense buying Cairn at this point of time but I do not see weakness in that. I still see a further up move to around Rs 10-12.What are you particularly observing on the charts there after that buzz move on MTNL?Whatever little I understand of MTNL, it gives big moves and then that move does not follow up. I would say this is a stock which normally flatters to deceive. So I would advise caution. Yes, it is looking good, it is looking good for a target of around 93-94 which is around 7-8-10% from current levels. But if one has to buy this stock, I would wait for a Rs 2-3-4 decline and buy it at 80-81 for a target of 90-92.I read you probably expect a 30 to35% return on Walchandnagar Industries. What is the timeframe and the rationale?Walchandnagar is just about to give a breakout. I hope we have caught this stock early where traders and investors can benefit. The actual buy is around once 236 is crossed, that the momentum in the stock will start. It has closed at 226 yesterday but the volumes that have occurred in the last four-five days suggest that this is on the way of a breakout and once above 236. This stock has the potential to go to even 280-290 and that can happen very very fast. My target is 275 with a six to eight-week time horizon and below 210, this stock can become weak. So that should be the stop loss. One can hold on for a little longer time. This can even go to 310-320 somewhere around that.One stock idea or one stock that you would watch out for today morning?As I said, Walchandnagar is one stock which I would look out and a four-five day perspective also it can be bought and can give 10-12%. So I would look at buying that in the morning irrespective of wherever it opens.You are looking at the charts of Siemens this morning, what you have seen?We had recommended this stock at around 550 with the 5 to 7% trading ideas maybe last week but today it has given a weekly breakout and our next target. I would want people to hold on, next target is coming to somewhere around 725. It is currently at 630, can be bought on a little bit of a correction up to 610, stop loss being around 590 and it has the potential to go up to around 725-730. This is possibly a four to six weeks’ time call.One more day of weakness pronounced at that for Infosys, 2500. Does it break that mark down?In fact in the morning we were talking of buying Infosys and TCS at lower levels but the way it is panning out, I am not very clear on it. I still see some more downside in the IT stocks.Would you still hold that view, buy TCS and perhaps avoid Infosys right now?No, both are equally weak. So at this point of time I will not buy Infosys, I would rather avoid the IT stocks. I will wait for some confirmation because other stocks are giving a very very clear cut pattern. So I would be a little negative on the IT stocks as well."

ET Now: What are your thoughts on Wednesday’s sell-off.
 
 
Mitesh Thacker: We have been expecting such a fall for quite some time. We got that confirmation when hourly chart pointed towards some kind of breakdowns early Tuesday. Post Wednesday’s trade, one can expect Bank Nifty to test 17,500 levels. For Nifty, we have talked about levels of around 7,935-7,940.
 
 Those levels appear to be the next-short term target. So, I would continue to trade with a negative bias. Buying into put options on the indices could be good strategy. While on the individual stock side, as and when they are breaking below their earlier swing lows, they could be good short trades.

Nifty may retest levels of 8000: Mitesh Thacker,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/nifty-may-retest-levels-of-8000-mitesh-thacker/articleshow/45628821.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty may retest levels of 8000: Mitesh Thacker,"In a chat with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on the markets. Edited Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: What is your sense of the how will you start of the new series? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: In terms of sectors I have a very similar outlook. I did mention that we will be exploring long positions on the banking side and look at adding short on pharma and IT. This is slightly surprising. Given the fact that if you look at the dollar-rupee equation, you will possibly look at exporters gaining over here. Technically if you look at the charts most of these stocks gain because pharma and IT are showing some kind of corrective set up. So for the time being that continues. 

 The Nifty today has broken below levels of around 8,200 and 8,180. This could possibly trigger some kind of down move and retest levels of around 8,000. So maybe next few days there will be some choppiness. Barring banks couple of PSU banks I would expect the market to drift slightly downwards, about a per cent or two per cent. Then we might look at some kind of reversal from those levels.

Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: What is your sense on the market over the next two sessions? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: I would want to see some kind of strength coming beyond 8950-8980 but till then the market upside would be capped and that would happen with some kind of positive news flow coming in but otherwise this is a market which will not fall aggressively therefore stock specific longs can be explored. 

 The level to watch on the downside is about 8800 as long as we are not breaking below 8800-8780 remotely, we might consolidate between 8950-8980 on the upside to about 8780 on the downside. 

 Eventually, my bias is on the upside and we should break on the upside. The key here could be the Bank Nifty which has been underperforming and that needs to start getting past 19,400 levels, once that happen you will see some kind of momentum pick up in bank which could aid the Nifty movement.

Nifty to find next support at 5950 level,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/nifty-to-find-next-support-at-5950-level/articleshow/30132399.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty to find next support at 5950 level," By Ashwani Gujral, Fund Manager, ashwanigujral.com  The Nifty had been coiling in a range of 6150-6350 and last week has gapped down from that pattern. This has unleashed energy bottled up in the market on the downside. It appears, with tapering being announced by the Fed, dollar assets are likely to go back to the US and hence fund flows may be impacted to emerging markets. 
 The Nifty is likely to find stiff resistance at 6150-70, and next support is going to come at 5950. Bank Nifty will continue to underperform. Support comes at 9900-10000 and resistance at 10400. CNXIT will continue to outperform in declines, but is unlikely to move with great momentum. Key weekly levels for the Nifty will be 6025 and for Bank Nifty it will be 10176 and 9697. 
 Tata Sponge 
 The company has a captive customer in Tata Steel. While the stock was consolidating in the 250-300 range in the last many months, suddenly last few days saw massive buying, which took it from 300 to 420. It's now gone through a sharp four-day correction and looks ready to move up again. It can be bought with a stop of around 300. Look for a target closer to 500. 
 Alembic Pharma 
 Pharma space has been showing a lot of tailwind and is considered an outperformer along with the tech sector as export-led stocks are doing extremely well. This is a classic bull market stock, which means the stock keeps making higher lows and higher highs regardless of the market situation. It can be bought with a stop of around 190. Look for a target of 300. 
 Motherson Sumi 
 Auto ancillary exporters are doing very well, as it appears global auto market is performing and Indian companies are globally competitive. The stock has continuously been an outperformer regardless of market conditions and recently went through a correction to 180 and came with great results on Friday. It's now possible to buy it with a stop of 180. Look for a target of 300.

 The company makes agriculture equipment and is in a turnaround mode. It is now sponsored by very savvy investors.

Mitesh Thacker: Technically, we have support at around 7,950-7,930 levels. Let us assume a scenario that we get a negative event. In such a case, I think we might open gap down and that could accelerate the selling pressure and we may see test of 7,800. Now suppose the level of 7,950 holds, and the market does not take the event very negatively and bounces back. Even then on the upside, anything beyond 8,100 looks extremely difficult. So rallies should be used to sell into. Even a gap down opening of 30-40 points would be a good selling opportunity on Friday.

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will present the final Union Budget for 2014-15 in Lok Sabha at 11:00 IST on Thursday, 10 July 2014. And on Wednesday, 9 July 2014, the Finance Ministry will table Economic Survey for 2013-14. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 12.50 points lower at 7,620 indicating flat-to-negative opening on the domestic market. 

 Hit by profit booking, the S&P BSE Sensex slipped as much as 517 points on Tuesday after hitting record highs in trade, while the 50-share Nifty index finally concluded the session with a deep cut of slightly over2% and closed at 7623. 

 On the eventful session of the Railway Budget, the benchmarks were seen declining almost vertically and lost more than two percent in the end. 

 ""We had recommended profit taking in the vicinity of 7790 to 7850. The decline witnessed today was particularly very sharp which even breached the initial support of 7650,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 ""Nifty now has a vital support in the range of 7570 - 7550 and if it manages to respect this support then there may be a bounce back till 7680 to 7700 range in next couple of sessions,"" added the report. 

 However, a breach of 7,500 on closing basis would force us to look at a deeper correction in coming weeks. 

 ""Now, it's important to see how the market reacts to the Economic Survey report which is scheduled on Wednesday i.e. 09th July, 2014,"" said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited. 

 ""On the downside, 7450 is a support area in Nifty so one should be watchful and keep the trading positions hedged,"" he added. 

 Overnight, U.S. stocks fell in a broad selloff dropping for a second straight session and driving the Dow below 17,000. 

 ""The advance has largely come on the back of strong data,"" said a Reuters report. Market participants are looking to earnings for confirmation that the economy recovered in the second quarter from the impact of a harsh winter, added the report. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 117.59 points or 0.69 percent, to 16,906.62. The S&P 500 slid 13.94 points or 0.70 percent, to 1,963.71. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 60.07 points or 1.35 percent, to 4,391.46.

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 2.50 points higher at 8,811 indicating positive opening on the domestic market. 

 Indian markets ended the day on a positive note after witnessing a choppy trade through the trading session. The S&P BSE Sensex closed 177 points higher at 28,885.21, while Nifty ended 64 points up at 8778.30 on Thursday. 

 ""Nifty is likely to move in a broader range for some time. This will remain a bounce back with some kind of choppiness coming in, but overall direction or the swing should be on the upside,"" says Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com. 

 ""We kind of managed to get pass 8750 on Thursday, and the next targets would be at 8865, possibly even 8945-8950 on the upside - so we are looking at these two targets,"" he adds. 

 Another important point highlighted by analysts is the fact that Reliance Industries and couple of banking names are lending support. 

 Unless and until we see 8680 being taken out, the immediate bias still on the upside, but yes I do not see 8950 or 9000 being crossed so easily, concludes Thacker. 

 Nifty has surged past the immediate resistance zone around the 8720-8750 mark. 

 ""In continuation to our earlier trajectory, we may see higher levels in the range of 8850-8920 mark. The immediate support has now shifted higher at the 8720-8650 mark,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 Overnight, US stocks closed higher as crude oil rebounded off a sharp decline, while investors bet that companies would top lowered expectations this earnings season. 

 ""Equities have struggled for direction of late, with investors seeing limited upside potential in equities, but also few alternatives for yield. Many investors are looking ahead to the first-quarter earnings season for market guidance,"" Reuters reported. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.22 points, or 0.31 percent, to 17,958.73, the S&P 500 gained 9.29 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,091.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.74 points, or 0.48 percent, to 4,974.57. 

 Asian markets were trading higher on news that Greece had made a 450 million euro loan payment to the International Monetary Fund trimmed safety bids for U.S. government debt. 

 ""The payment to the IMF secured extra emergency lending for Greek banks and helped improve global risk sentiment, though it remained unclear whether Athens could satisfy creditors who remain skeptical on the country's economic reforms,"" added the Reuters report.

ET Now: What would be yourclosing thoughts for the day? 

 Ashwani Gujral: Well, some kind of momentum has picked up on the downside. Today was a right day to go short on this market and chances are that if we do get follow through, we should slowly head towards 5180-5150 levels and then may be 5100. Today we have closed at a very interesting point on the Bank Nifty because this trend line I keep talking about 4770 through 5050, today was tested around 5220. 

 So once 5220 gives up, then the entire rally we had from 4770 to about 5400, that ends and you start a downside move. It is often easierto move on the downside if global markets also participate. In case that starts,then it will be a bit easier to go down, but clearly metals, banks and most ofthese sectors at intermediate lows are likely to make fresh lows. 

 
ET Now: What is your call on the market? 

 Ashwani Gujral: While the Nifty has not given you that thrust that you need to get a decisive move in one direction. Bank Nifty has done that often, the parameter for that is about 1.5%, the Bank Nifty has done 1.5% downside. So, while Nifty is still kind of up and down, the Bank Nifty has given the clearer move so that is where the short trade can come into play. 

 We have cut long positions on the Nifty. So now you can easily keep a 10,050 type of a stop on Bank Nifty and play for some bigger downside to about 9550. So in that regard the short side you can play much better on the Bank Nifty, then on the Nifty itself. The breakdown level on Nifty was 5230, we went down 10 points below it. 

 Now we are couple of points above it, so that is not giving you that clear decisive move which can help you go short but clearly the upside bias on the Nifty is probably not there now. So on individual stocks JSPL is a sell with a stop of about 346, target of 325. JSW Steel is a sell with a stop of about 675, target of 630 and Zee Enterprise buy with a stop of about 165, target of 185.

NHPC: Timely completion of projects crucial for company,"{""NHPC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nhpc-timely-completion-of-projects-crucial-for-company/articleshow/15598594.cms,m.economictimes.com,NHPC: Timely completion of projects crucial for company,"The tardy pace of capacity addition at India's biggest hydro-power company NHPC has dampened investor interest in the stock. The stock has fallen 50% since its listing in July 2009 and is now trading close to an all-time low.
 
 Many of its delayed projects, with aggregate capacity of close to 1372 MW, are likely to be commissioned in FY13 and FY14. Timely completion of these projects will be critical for the company to restore investor confidence.
 
 The company recently commissioned the 154 MW Chamera III plant, which was delayed by around two years. Many other projects of the company too are delayed, and two of its most profitable projects , the 800 MW Parbati II and 2000 MW Subansiri projects are behind schedule by over five years.
 
 The company expects to commission six of the delayed projects, with of a total capacity 1372 MW, in the next two years within a three-tosix months span. In FY13, the company expects to commission 1212 MW, or 24% of the current capacity of 5500 MW.
 
 Due to the high incidence of missing targets, most brokerages are highly skeptical about the company's ability to achieve the target. They are assuming only 40-60 % of project completion for their calculation of the company's future earnings estimates .
 
 According to them, the company's earnings are likely to grow only 2% in FY13. In the June quarter, NHPC's revenues fell 2.3% year-onyear to Rs 1,399 crore, while operating profit fell 10.4% to Rs 1,149 crore and net profit dipped 15.3% to Rs 670 crore.
 
 The rise in the company's debtors too is a concern. Its debtor position was Rs 2,100 crore at the end of the June quarter.
 
 Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Jharkhand account for two-thirds of the troubled debt. The company plans to recover this in installments with interest. Due to its lackluster performance in the past and slow execution, NHPC's stock is trading below its net worth or book value.
 
 
KEY POINTS
 
 The company recently commissioned the 154 MW Chamera III plant, which was delayed by around two years.

NCDEX mulls relaunch of Brent contract soon,"{""NCDEX"": ""neutral"", ""Brent"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/ncdex-mulls-relaunch-of-brent-contract-soon/articleshow/7415251.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,NCDEX mulls relaunch of Brent contract soon,"
  MUMBAI: National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) proposes to relaunch its illiquid Brent-benchmarked contract with some changes in the contract specifications. 
  
  At present, the bourse has a crude contract referenced to West Texas Intermediate contract that’s traded on New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex). The Brent contract is traded on InterContinental Exchange (ICE), which holds a 2.96% stake in NCDEX. 
  
  “We have recently applied to Forward Markets Commission (FMC) for a change in contract specs,” said R Ramaseshan, MD & CEO of NCDEX. “We propose to increase the tick size from Rs 0.50 to Rs 1.” A phone call and a text message to BC Khatua, chairman of FMC, to get the regulator’s response remained unanswered. 
  
  The tick size — the minimum price a contract can move up or down — is 50 paise currently. By doubling the tick size, both profit and loss of a trader will be doubly magnified. For example, if the minimum size of a crude contract is 100 barrels, the value of a tick in a contract with a tick size of 50 paise is Rs 50. This would increase to Rs 100 if tick size is doubled to Rs 1. 
  
  It remains to be seen if a change in tick size will result in liquidity rising, a market watcher said. “NCDEX may have launched Brent with a lower tick size to attract volumes but considering the contract has been illiquid, it may have decided to standardise it by bringing the tick size on a par with that of the WTI benchmarked contract,” said Krishna Nathani, MD of indiabullion.com, a Chennai-based commodity research firm. 
  
  The mainly farm-led trading bourse has been focussing on crude oil whose volumes have gone up after Delhi brokerage Jaypee Capital was inducted as NCDEX’s anchor investor in October last year.
  
  Upon becoming a stakeholder in a commex, regulatory norms require an entity to surrender membership of that bourse. Earlier, Mr Khatua told ET that Jaypee Capital’s Gaurav Arora had informed the regulator that he had surrendered directorship of Jaypee Commodities, a broking member of NCDEX. 
  
  FMC data for the fortnight ended January 15 show the value of crude oil futures trading on NCDEX was Rs 27,549 crore against Rs 80,422 crore by MCX which is the market leader in metals and energy trading. MCX also offers a Brent contract but trading is illiquid on it compared with its WTI contract.
  
  Of late, the Brent contract at over $100 a barrel has traded at a $10 premium to WTI due to local issues in the US which has seen supplies from Canada and a build-up of storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, said an oil trader at a PSU oil refining company.

 The increased profit is on account of increased margins in the products coming out of the secondary units in Phase III units, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) Chairman DK Saraff told reporters here. 

 The profit also increased on account of increase in the gap between the prices of crude oil and those of refined products during the first quarter 2015-16 as compared to the corresponding previous quarter, Saraff said. 

 The Company's refining throughput was 3.89 MMT as against 3.20 MMT in the corresponding quarter of previous year, Saraff said. 

 The GRM for the quarter was posted at $6.62/bbl as against $0.66 /bbl during the corresponding quarter, he added. 

 Saraff said the company has successfully started commercial production of polypropylene from its 440 KTPA (Kilo-Tonnes Per Annum) Polypropylene Unit (PPU) on June 18, 2015. 

 ""With this, MRPL's Phase-III of refining expansion is fully completed,"" he said. 

 Saraff said the company has initiated downward integration by amalgamation of ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Limited (OMPL) with MRPL. 

 ""OMPL has recently commissioned a state-of-the-art Aromatic Complex with 914 KTPA capacity of Para-Xylene and 283 KPTA capacity of benzene adjacent to the refinery,"" he said. 

 The company could evacuate higher volumes of products in domestic market thereby reducing the exports, Saraff said. 

 The percentage of domestic volume during Q1 of FY 2015-16 stood at 70 per cent as against 60 per cent in the first quarter of 2014-15, Saraff said, adding, ""Typically net price realised in domestic market is more than that in export.""

  He is confidant of achieving Rs 40,000 crore disinvestment target for this fiscal, the highest figure so far since the start of the divestment programme.
  
  
  As of now, the central government holds a little over 80% in MOIL, which is one of the leading Manganese ore producers in the world, while Maharashtra has about 10% and MP about 9% in the company. The governments are proposing to sell 3.36 crore shares of the company in the IPO. The pricing will be announced closer to the opening of the offer. 
  
  
  On Monday, CARE ratings gave the highest IPO grading of 5 to MOIL IPO. The company is the largest producer of Manganese ore in India, accounting for about 50% of the country’s total production in FY 2007-08 . In the last financial year, MOIL had reported a net profit of Rs 457 crore on a net sales of Rs 969.4 crore.

  Last week dollar underperformed against its majors and marked a low of 79.74 but off lately good employment numbers, pending home sales, and manufacturing PMI has helped dollar to regain its strength against its majors and registered weekly high at 80.31. 
  There was no economic data released on Friday as US celebrated its Independence Day, as a result there was a low volume trade which hardly changed the value of dollar. 
  No data to be released in the opening day of the week which will enable dollar to take cues from the European market. 
 
DXY
: Greenback on Friday was tad higher as it went above the resistance level of 80.30 and closed at 80.26 levels. It is imperative for the dollar to stay above the level of 80.50 which will open further positive possibilities.

Other Markets
 
 
 
  India?s 10-year G-Sec -.Ten-year benchmark yield is up at 8.69% on some position building before the Budget session in Parliament, which begins tomorrow with the Railway budget. The RBI continued with its borrowing program announcing auctions of eight state governments of 4/5/ 10-year government bonds of Rs 6,300 crore on July 08, 2014. As on July 4, they completed auctions of Rs 15,000 crore of the 8.35% 2022, 8.60%0 2028, 9.20% 2030 and 9.23% 2043 bonds, at cut off yields of 8.70, 8.57, 8.69 and 8.67 respectively. It also completed a one-day day repo auction for Rs 16, 229 crore at 8.00% under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) today. 
  US Treasury Market -:Ten-year benchmark yield was at 2.64%, after peaking at 2.69%, on a strong jobs report, with an increase of 288000 after an expectation of 218000. The unemployment rate also dipped to 6.1%, last seen six years ago. Treasuries are likely to fall on speculation that the US will raise interest rates faster than anticipated, with many leading institutions revising its rate increases to third quarter of 2015, citing better than expected job data. Market is likely to take its cues from the FOMC minutes due for release on Wednesday. Chinese trade data and inflation due this week will also affect prices in the near term. 
  Crude Oil-:. Prices of WTI Crude dropped further to $ 103.82 as geopolitical tensions eased and a better picture of growth emerged from the US. The dollar has become stronger with the DXY Index ticking up to 80.33 after languishing at levels of 79.80 most of the previous week. Confirmation that the two export terminals in Libya are expected to open soon, added to the positive sentiment. Though the prices have slipped below the psychological 104 levels, the key will be the breaking of the next support at $103.50 levels. 
  Gold-: A stronger dollar continues to weigh on gold prices, with Gold breaking a key support level of $1316 to trade at $1314. However, the speculation on whether the Fed will actually change its timetable to raise interest rates earlier is likely to keep prices ranged till Wednesday, when the FOMC meeting minutes are to be released.Technically, having broken the $1316 level, the next support lies at $1305.50 and the resistance at $1330. With the safe haven factor evaporating, gold is likely to take its cues from dollar strength/ weakness in the coming weeks.

The Fed announced the expected $10 billion cut to its almost two-year-old bond-buying program and reaffirmed its intention to keep interest rates low for a considerable period of time.

The dollar gained with the DXY upto 81.40 levels on a strong reading of the second quarter GDP coming in at 4% versus an expectation of 3% and against a previous reading of -2.1%. The Fed acknowledged the growth and continued with the wind down of its bond buying program with a tick down to $25 billion from $35 billion.

The fall in Euro was due to improvement in US economy as the GDP numbers impressed the market participants which helped dollar to gain strength and as such Euro faltered. 	 		Euro lost momentum further as the CPI m/m data of Germany slowed down, raising questions whether the ECB?s recent measures are having the intended effect on the economy or not.

The overall trend is negative.  Other Markets   	 		India?s 10-year G-Sec -. Ten-year benchmark yield is quoting below par at 8.49% as RBI?s move to switch to multiple price auctions from uniform price auction seems to have spooked bond traders. Today there is a second auction for the ten year benchmark for Rs 9000 crores, which is also expected to be aggressively bid. The seven day repo auction for Rs 20,000 crore was completed yesterday at a cut off yield of 8.16%. Yesterday the RBI also conducted a 182 day and 91 day Tbill auctions of Rs 6000 crore and Rs 9000 crore at cut off yields of 8.64 and 8.70 respectively. RBI also conducted a one -day reverse repo of Rs 11,949 crores at a fixed rate of 7.00% and a one-day repo auction of Rs 18,061 crores at a fixed rate of 8.00% under the Liquid Adjustment Facility. 	 		US Treasury Market -: The Treasury markets took direction from the FOMC meeting minutes and a positive second quarter GDP which was up at 4.00% against a previous reading of -2.10%. The ten-year benchmark yield jumped 9.5 basis points to trade at 2.55% as investors considered a better than expected GDP and an inflation component in the GDP Report i.e. the PCE Index was up to 2.3%. The FOMC meeting minutes also acknowledged inflation and better growth, while maintaining its comfort with the wind down of the bond stimulus and the accommodative monetary stance for a considerable time. However the element of dissent was stronger and it seems probable that interest rate hikes could come sooner, especially if the labor market numbers continue to improve. 	 		Crude Oil-: WTI Crude oil moved back to trade at $ 99.13 below the psychological level of $ 100. While there was some pressure on account of sanctions on Russia, FOMC?s comments that the labor market slack was a matter of concern, reduced the impact of better US growth and the pressure on oil prices. The US Inventories Report also showed crude oil stocks dropped by 3.7 million barrels as against an expectation of a 1.5 million barrel drop, which for the most part was ignored by investors. Brent too is trading lower at $ 106 levels 	 		Gold-:. Gold dropped on the strong US GDP report to trade at $1292 before climbing back to trade at $ 1295 levels. The Fed?s reassessment of the US economy, which acknowledged growth and inflationary pressures, added salt to the wound. While geopolitical tensions both in Ukraine and Gaza should support prices, a strong DXY at 81.44 levels will exert pressure on Gold. Technically, gold is supported at $1287 with a resistance at $1314 levels.  "

In addition, an oil payment tranche of $ 550 million to Iran was also completed yesterday. Expectations on the general budget as well as likely RBI intervention will keep trading ranged between 59.50 ? 60.00 levels today . 
  US stocks and bond yields eased substantially ahead of the earnings season and the FOMC Minutes due today. Comments by Narayanan Kocherlakota put futher pressure on yields when he said that the dip in the unemployement rate was welcome but the labour market had a long way to go before it reached Fed?s goals. He indicated that he saw no inflationary bias in the economy in the near term and believed inflation would come in at less than the Fed?s target of 2.00 per cent. In short, what he meant presumably wa that the Fed was at status quo , despite the market expectation of a more hawkish outlook.

In UK too, there was an unusual dip in manufacturing and industrial productionwith manufacturing output falling 1.3% (mom) and industrial production falling 0.7%. 
  Asian Markets are all down as are Asian currencies, probably beaten down by the correction in the US stock markets and a dip in the Chinese CPI which came in at 2.3% vis a vis an expectation of 2.4% . In early trade, the Sensex is flat, with a 10 point gain and Nifty is trading at 7622 levels. 
  In domestic news, the Rail Budget, despite the reaction from stock markets, was analysed as having no adverse impact on the fiscal deficit, while increasing facilities and infrastructure available to the customer.

In the last week, foreign funds have exhausted 51% of their limit to invest in Indian bonds. Corporate bond issues are also up with ONGC completing a $ 2 billion bond issue this week. However, the upcoming budget and the fiscal deficit target it lays down is likely to determine direction of yields in the near term The RBI completed auctions of 4/5/ 10 year state development loans of nine state governments of Rs 8500 crore at cut yields ranging from 8.90 ? 9.00% yesterday.

  India?s 10-year G-Sec -: Benchmark 10 year yield yesterday closed at 8.56% up by 0.20% from its previous day close. Today it is quoting at 8.58% up by 2 points. Experts came out of the view that it can come down to 8% by the year end as the 50bps reduction in SLR to 22.5% will only add to the excess liquidity lying with banks and may not lead to lower rates. It is, however, a signal that, RBI will provide liquidity if demand rises. Reduction in liquidity under ECR will be offset by the special term repo facility. RBI will further moderate its policy stance in the next meeting without reducing rates. For FY15, we expect rates to moderate by 50 bps and G-Sec yield is likely to be about 8% by fiscal end. RBI accepted 52 bids worth Rs. 184.22 billion under the Repo auction this morning. 
  US Treasury Market -: Treasuries sell off pushed yields on 10-year notes to the highest level in four weeks before the U.S. sells $21 billion of the securities today. Treasuries have been falling since the Labor Department reported June 6 that U.S. employers added more than 200,000 jobs for a fourth month in May. It reached a level of 2.66% overnight and has been stable at this level since then. 
  Crude Oil-: Crude oil prices rose Tuesday and crossed its previous high of $104.50 and it is now quoting at $104.48 was helped by higher than expected China inflation that bolstered the demand outlook for the commodity. However, with fundamentals unsupportive, its upward journey is likely to face stiff resistance even at the nearest target. As the twists and turns in the geopolitical scenario and monetary and currency conditions are unpredictable which can affect the crude oil prices. 
  Gold-: Gold settled above $1260 for the first time after 2 weeks due to weakness in equities yesterday as now investors will watch closely the data scheduled this week and getting s modest boost inflationary news coming from Europe and China.

Chidambaram. He said that the 4.8% is the red line which he will not cross in any case on the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit was at 94% of the Annual Budget for the FY 2013-14.
 The Government?s cash register is ringing again, raising the hope that the fiscal slide would have begun to get arrested in December and the government would achieve its fiscal deficit target for the year. The Finance Ministry on Wednesday deferred a planned, Rs. 15000 crore bond auction to raise funds in view of its comfortable cash position because of robost tax collection in the month of December and in anticipation of large dividend inflows. 
 India?s economy is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2014 as global growth gathers pace, the World Bank said in a report on Wednesday. In June, the multilateral agency had forecast growth at 4.7% for 2014. The government expects growth to be around 5-5.5% in the current fiscal and then to gather pace on the back of an improvement in exports and projects coming on stream. But economists and other agencies expect growth to remain sluggish at around 5% level, similar to 2012-13. 
 USDINR: The agency said global economic indicators were displaying signs of improvement and raised growth estimates for the world economy. Global GDP growth is projected to improve from 2.4% in 2013 to 3.2% this year, stabilizing at 3.4% and 3.5% in 2015 and 2016 respectively, with much of the initial acceleration reflecting stronger growth in high-income economies, the World Bank?s Global Economic Prospects report said. The Reserve Bank of India decided to grant more flexibility for hedging foreign exchange exposures, by relaxing rules for cancellation and rebooking forward contracts.

  Euro dropped by 92 pips during the day to the low of 1.3573 on the back of broad based dollar strength due to better than expected US economic data points. The single currency however picked up in the current session as World Bank forecasts better growth prospects for euro region.  
  European stock markets advanced for a fourth-straight day yesterday after the World Bank said growth will pick up pace in 2014. The Stoxx Europe 600 index rallied 1% to end at 334.51, reaching the highest closing level since January 2008. Germany?s DAX 30 index however, rallied 2% to 9,733.81.

  Euro area and the Germany?s CPI, speech of BundesBank President Weidmann and monthly Bulletin from ECB would be the key events for the day.  
 
EUR/ USD: The euro today would largely be driven by some key US economic data points. Break above the nearest resistance and yesterday's top at 1.3674 may trigger further strengthening of the Euro. Going below yesterday's bottom and first support at 1.3580, however, would confirm continuation of the bearish trend, towards next objective downwards 1.3466.

Other Markets
 
 
 
  India?s 10-year G-Sec-: The 10-year G-sec yields closed yesterday?s session at 8.63 percent 8bps down from its previous close. Yields eased yesterday after the release of WPI numbers, inflation dipped sharply to a five- month low at 6.16 percent in December 2013. The moderation was mainly driven by a fall in vegetable prices. Strengthened expectations of no rate hike by central bank has also helped the yields. In current session, benchmark 10-year yields are trading at 8.62 percent. RBI also deferred bond auction scheduled for the current week supporting the sentiment for G-sec market. As far as liquidity is concerned, a total of 65 banks bid for a total of Rs. 41162 crores today. 
  US Treasury Market: Treasuries witnessed slight weakness yesterday. 10-year US yields ended the session at 2.89 percent. Yields rose yesterday after positive PPI data release. We might see 10-year yields continue to trade in range of 2.75-3.00 percent for short term. In current session, yields are hovering at about same levels only at 2.87 percent. Looking ahead trading in the treasury market could be impacted by the release of Unemployment claims and Core CPI data. 
  Crude Oil-: Crude oil price climbed as US inventory declined noticeably and US data impressed. Crude inventories fell to the lowest level since March 2012 in the US. The front-month contract for WTI crude oil jumped to a 2-week high of 94.82 before ending the day at 94.51 levels. Immediate resistance for the WTI oil is seen near 95 levels successful break above that will target 95.20-96.00 also overall trend remains upside. 
  Gold-: The yellow metal ended lower for a second consecutive session after the release of upbeat and positive data from US. Gold ended yesterday?s session at $ 1241.86 per ounce. U.S. Producer price index rose 0.4 percent in December. The data was in line with estimates. The increase was partly due to a rebound in energy prices, which surged 1.6 percent in December after falling 0.4 percent in November. In current session gold is trading at $ 1241 per ounce. Gold is expected to trade in thin range between 1225 and 1250 for sometime. A upward move cannot be expected unless we see a constant rise above $1250. The strength in greenback may help it to hold on to its current levels for few more days.

  The Manufacturing PMI data was released yesterday marking at 57.5 against 56.4, expanded more strongly than expected in June, with the rate of growth and key sub indexes advancing to their highest levels in more than four years. 
  New home sales rose to a six-year high, surging 18.6% in May to an annual rate of 504,000. May's figure was the highest level since May 2008 and the largest monthly increase since January 1992. The above positive releases indicate that the ailing economy is on the brink to recover. 
  Consumer confidence index jumped to 85.2 in June from 82.0 last month. It was the highest reading since January 2008 which helped dollar to pick up momentum and helped it to close in a green territory. 
  Yesterday President of New York Federal Reserve Bank William Dudley said investor expectations that the Fed may raise the main interest rate in mid-2015 may prove incorrect but now it can be a reasonable forecast. FED will possibly not raise the interest rate unless it winds down bond buying stimulus in this year. 
  While Charles Plosser think that FED should increase the interest rate by mid 2015 as FED is achieving its goals faster as unemployment could drop to 5.8% this year and inflation should move back to central bank?s 2% target. 
  Geopolitical concerns watered down the dollar's earlier gains, sending investors to safe-haven assets like gold, which tends to trade inversely with the greenback. 
  Reports that Syrian warplanes hit targets in western Iraq earlier Tuesday in an effort to join Iran and support the embattled Baghdad. Fears began to grow the conflict will increase in duration and complexity, especially if Washington gets more involved.

  DXY: Greenback yesterday formed a spinning top (candlestick pattern) which suggests that the previous trend is uncertain. Two days prior it formed a doji pattern but failed to give confirmation. In spinning top it requires a confirmation on the following day. A move above 80.45 can take prices higher till 80.84 levels. However, if it falls below 80.20 levels then it can test the crucial level of 79.80 levels. RSI and MACD both are showing negative signs as they are below their respective equilibrium from above.

Dollar witnessed selling pressure by exporters supported by weakness in dollar, which has lifted rupee yesterday. Rupee made a low of 60.20 and was trading in a thin range of 60.07-60.20 before ending at 60.13. 
  Today the local unit opened at 60.23 down by 10 paise. The range of 60.00-60.45 is intact and as far as prices persist in this range there will be hardly any movement in this pair. It is imperative for this pair to break free form this range. 
  Indian equity benchmark Sensex and Nifty saw a decent rally yesterday snapping its four day losing streak closing up by 337.58 points up by 1.35% at 25369 levels and Nifty up by 80 odd points ending at 7579 levels. The local equities now wait for the budget for further trigger which is set to release in July second week. Today the equities were flat but the midcaps and smallcaps are still moving higher.

  Technically Speaking, USDINR continues to trade in a range of 60.10-60.45 from past 6 trading sessions. For further positive possibilities prices need to cross 60.45 decisively which can take it higher till 60.70 levels. Failure to protect the level of 59.85 will drag prices till 59.60 levels.

  On economic data releases, The IFO Business Climate Index for industry and trade in Germany fell to 109.7 points in June from 110.4 points last month. Assessment of the current business situation remained good, but companies were less optimistic about future business developments as the worries of Iraq escalate. The fall in the IFO is a signal that the euro zone?s growth engine is slowing down and German businesses are quite unimpressed by measures taken by the European Central Bank. 
  However, in Belgium NBB business climate improved slightly in June. Business confidence firmed up a little in the manufacturing industry and, to a greater extent, in trade and the building industry which helped Euro to close in green territory. 
  European Bourses Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.2 percent to 345.57 at the close of trading. While CAC40 and DAX both were tad higher at 4518.34 and 9938.08 respectively with a change of 0.06% and 0.17%.

  The currency pair fell after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said wages weren?t rising as quickly as the central bank anticipated, damping speculation of an imminent increase in interest rates. 
  As a result, there?s been some marginal position shifting with sterling weakening. If wage growth continues to disappoint, the BOE will have to take that into account.

  India?s 10-year G-Sec -:Ten-year benchmark yield eased further to 8.71 % today on higher demand, on the back of a temporary de-escalation of tensions in Iraq yesterday. Volumes in the Interest Rate Futures , which has its underlying as the ten year GOI bond, moved up from Rs 6.26 to Rs 12 .12 billion, at the start of the week, while calendar spreads week on week has reduced to 2 bps from 13 bps last week. Today oil prices have ticked up, on Syrian planes bombing parts of Western Iraq, but gold remains steady. The RBI announced results of the auction of 10-year paper for twelve state governments? of Rs 7130 of which Rs 6130 crore was allotted at yields ranging between 8.90 ? 9.00%. They also completed a one-day reverse repo auction for Rs 15.00 crores at 7.00% and a one-day repo auction for Rs 181 crore at 8.00% under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) today. The support comes to 8.65%, breach of this support can drag it till 8.58% in near term 
  US Treasury Market -: US treasuries ticked up on increased tensions in Iraq and Ukraine as well as investors turning away from dull trading on Wall Street. The yield on the ten-year paper ticked down to 2.59%, as investors are slowly coming round to Fed?s view that the data on new home sales and consumer confidence released yesterday is possibly not strong enough to warrant an strong up tick in interest rates. The auction for the $ 30 billion two-year notes was finally completed at a yield of 0.511%. It is trading at 2.59% a move below 2.58% will accelerate selling pressure which can take prices lower till 2.52% 
  Crude Oil-:.Prices of WTI Crude moved up 6% to $ 106.69, amid reports that US has cleared export of unrefined oil for the first time since the 1970?s. In addition, escalation of violence in both Iraq and Ukraine, with Syrian airstrikes in Western Iraq, has seen oil prices rise. Brent crude, which retraced to $ 113 levels yesterday, has also risen back to $114. Technically, for WTI Crude, the previous price point of $105 will act as a support, keeping price movement sideways, watching further developments on the geopolitical horizon. 
  Gold-: Spot Gold is trading steady at $1314 levels, down 3% from yesterday?s price and looks range bound taking cues from developments in Iraq and Ukraine. A weak German IFO, which seems to reflect the reality in the Euro zone and mildly strong numbers on US new home sales and consumer confidence are also supporting the yellow metal. The markets tried to rally yesterday but pulled back at $1320 levels. A take out of the resistance at $1318 should see prices move much higher.

  The local unit opened almost flat at 60.85, against a close of 60.83 on Friday. Asian equities fell, especially Shanghai and Hang Seng, as talk of likely property defaults in the northern part of Hong Kong kept prices presurred. In early trade, the Sensex is down by 93 points and the Nifty down 34 points at 8086. Rupee likely to trade in a range of 60.60- 61.00 levels, with payment pressure from importers and Central bank intervention capping further gains. 
  Indian stock markets have seen volatile trading all of the last week, with FII flows continuing to keep markets buoyant, even as investors mulled the contagion effect of an early interest rate in the US as well as lethargic off take of credit and slow exports and industrial production in the Asian region. For India, the problems are complicated by high inflation, which the IMF, in its note preceding the G20 meet has highlighted. The RBI thus has its hands tied in terms of easing interest rates to boost productivity, and is dependant on central government reform and foreign aid to boost productivity. Since the impact of both these is slow in coming, investors play a wait and watch game, even as cheap money flows continues to drive their search for yields. 
  It is a data light week both globally and domestically, with few factors that could drastically change outlook.

While an interest rate would be welcome for the industry, it is expected that the Central bank would need to see consistently lower readings to move on that. Today WPI inflation for September is expected and the trend could be lower.

He reiterated that the government will take necessary steps for Corporate to deter companies from cutting tax bills by moving their address from one to another country. 	 		In the morning session, consumer credit m/m marked at 26.0B against 18.8B earlier indicating that consumers are willing to take loans for automobiles and tuition fees and are also aware of their financial capabilities to pay back. The consumer credit has surged by most in three years. 	 		No other data was released yesterday which enabled Dollar index to take cues from European markets. 	 		US Bourses on Monday closed on a mixed bag as Dow Jones was down by 25 points closing at 17111. S&P 500 was down by 6 ending at 2001 levels and NASDAQ was up by 9 points closing at 4592 levels.

Scotland?s bid for independence has severely beaten down the Pound and the Euro with stock markets in the region hitting lows as well. US Stocks too ended mostly lower. Asian stocks which started off on a positive note also ended mixed. The British Government scrambled to offer more freedom to Scotland giving them more autonomy over tax revenues and spending, but a number of polls published seem to indicate that a majority in Scotland are looking to secede from the UK ending the 307 year Union. Uncertainty increased in global markets as the implications of the move are still unclear to the global investor, with no clarity from either the British or the Scottish government on a new currency versus the pound, the impact of the same on those holding Scottish assets. 	 		In domestic news, economic data releases due this week are likely to be keenly watched by investors. August IIP is expected to come in weaker at 0.8% yoy down from 3.4% in July mainly on account of unfavorable base effect and moderation in core industries. This is likely to continue into September if no solution is found for the coal crisis. The Supreme Court is expected to take a decision on the fate of coal block allocations which it declared illegal earlier and decide a course of action. The government of India has suggested a middle path of sparing some of the 42 of illegal coal block allocations but it remains to be seen whether this will be accepted by the Supreme Court. 	 		August CPI is expected to moderate slightly to 7.8% from 8.0% on base effect even though vegetable prices were higher by 22% yoy. However mitigating crude prices should see this number drop in the medium term. Brent Crude at the current time has slid below $100 level at 99.36. 	 		Technically speaking, USDINR yesterday closed near the level of 60.30 and today it opened with a gap up indicating that the downside is capped and the pair has to move up from current levels.

Further, Richmond manufacturing index marked at 14 against 12 earlier which rise to 3 year high indicating that manufacturing is doing well. The rise in the manufacturing index was due to rise in new orders which also increased employment. 	 		US Bourses on Tuesday was down despite of some upbeat economic releases.

Equities globally were weaker yesterday as investors mulled slowing growth in the Eurozone and China as well as an uptick in geopolitical tensions with Israel striking down a Syrian warplane and the expanding airstrikes in the region by US and its allies. In early trade, the Sensex is up by 21 points and the Nifty up by six points at 8023. Rupee likely to trade in a range of 60.80- 61.20 levels. 	 		The India story still has got a lot of appeal for foreign investors says the IFC, the World bank?s private sector arm who are in talks with Indian regulators to sell another $2 million of rupee denominated bonds to overseas investors. The company had launched $1 billion fund last year which saw a strong response. Earlier this year it had raised another $100 million through the issue of rupee denominated bonds available to both domestic and foreign investors. 	 		Perhaps this positive sentiment is also reflected by the yields of the 10 year GOI Bonds which have fallen to its lowest level of 8.44% in the last two months. In addition to an easing of inflationary pressures (a lower CPI and WPI) the CAD target is looking increasingly reachable for the government. Additionally the Government is continuing its repurchase program making an announcement to repurchase Rs 8000 crores of securities. 	 		The Supreme Court will meet today to take a final call on the coal allocations. This could be a prime mover for the equity market depending on whether they chose to cancel the allocations completely or simply impose a penalty on the illegal allocations. 	 		Globally, the picture remains dismal, as the lack of inflation and poor manufacturing growth continued to plague the developed world. The composite PMI for Europe came in 52.3, a nine month low, as Germany and France, two of the biggest economies struggled to keep its PMI?s above the contraction level. The US bond markets too have slashed expectations of future inflation to their lowest levels in three years. Expectations of inflation as measured by comparing yields between Treasury inflation protected securities and those of Treasury bonds have reached their lows of June 2013. 	 		Technically speaking, USDINR has opened at 61.03 but continue to trade below 61.00 levels. The crucial resistance of 61.20 still holds and it is expected that it will move down till 60.70 levels. The pair for today can trade in the range of 60.80-61.10 levels but the short term view for this pair is negative testing cluster of supports at 60.70.   EURUSD  				Currency 				Trend 				Exp.

No data is schedule to release today and as such Pound is expected to take cues from US markets.  GBP/USD: The pair is trendless or directionless which is making it to trade in the region of 1.6300-1.6500 levels.

Yields of the ten year benchmark, ticked up to 2.52% after the sale of the two year notes of $29 billion which showed a strong demand from foreign buyers in light of slowing demand in Eurozone and China as well as a jump in geopolitical tensions on the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.

However the long term fundamentals are still bearish so this is probably nothing more than a short term bounce.  "

  After a long weekend the local unit opened stronger at 59.81 levels after closing last week at 59.89 levels. The range for the Indian Rupee is seen between 59.60?60.10 levels. 
  The Indian rupee posted its biggest quarterly gain since the September quarter of 2012 as heavy foreign buying of equities and debt boosted the local unit, but further gains could be capped by a cautious central bank. 
  The rupee also breached the 60-per-dollar mark for the first time in eight months, prompting the central bank to start building up their reserves. Some traders speculated the central bank has likely bought nearly $2-$3 billion over this week in its attempt to slow the rupee's rally. 
  Foreign funds have purchased a net $3.7 billion in equities from the start of 2014 until March 27 while in debt the net inflows stand at $5.8 billion. 
  The one-year onshore forward premium rose to 519 points, not far from its record high of 525.25 points as the central bank likely conducted sell buy swaps in the forward as per the traders. 
  With elections looming and an uncertain economic growth outlook, the Reserve Bank of India left interest rates on hold on Tuesday, as expected, and indicated it will keep rates steady in the near term if inflation eases towards the bank's targeted level. 
  But in a move to impose more discipline on lenders and in line with global practice, the central bank cut the amount of overnight funding it makes available to banks, nudging them to use longer-term funding in a push to deepen financial markets. 
  RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan warned of risks that inflation could rise even as risks to economic growth are to the downside.? If electoral outcomes fail to provide a stable government, the downside risks to growth could accentuate,"" the RBI said in a report accompanying its policy statement. 
  India's election commission on Tuesday allowed the Reserve Bank of India to announce new bank licenses even ahead of general elections set to conclude next month, according to a notice in the commission's website. This move would further add to the positive sentiment in the local equity market too. 
  Reserve Bank of India will remove pricing restriction on entry and exit of foreign direct investment (FDI). The central bank says it would like to move to market practices, operating guidelines will be issued soon. This is one of the biggest announcements by the RBI yesterday but markets have been preoccupied with the monetary policy statement. 
  Till now India has always wished control on how foreign investors will enter or exit India in terms of pricing and now the RBI is taking a far more mature view saying look we are going to leave it up to market players. As of now, no major details are announced. The statement seems to be positive to remove the 
  restriction on foreign players, but again we have to wait for further clarifications and details on the same. 
  The Asian markets are trading higher after an increase in U.S. manufacturing boosted optimism about growth in the world?s biggest economy. 
  Trading would be cautious, ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank and Friday's U.S. jobs numbers, both of which could move markets in major ways. 
  Investors have also been speculating that the European Central Bank would soon take further steps to loosen policy, though officials are blowing hot and cold on the issue. 
  On Tuesday, ECB vice-president Vitor Constancio told a news conference that low inflation was a concern and could drag on economic growth. Euro zone inflation slowed to an annual 0.5 percent in March, it?s lowest since November 2009. 
  But Constancio then went on to deny any risk of deflation, saying inflation was set to pick up. That was taken as diminishing the chance of an easing at the ECB's policy meeting on Thursday and gave the euro a modest lift. 
  Rupee gains to 59.80 ? 59.70 levels, which is again a strong support zone, where we can see some buyers emerging. The weekly close below 59.70 levels is very important, if it manages to close above it then we can see 59.00 levels too. But a weak weekly close above 60.00 could provide opportunity for the exporters to sell. Exporters as said earlier keep selling on upticks.

  The euro bounced back against the U.S. dollar even as softer-than-forecast inflation numbers added to the discussion of whether the European Central Bank will cut interest rates when it meets on Thursday. 
  The data initially supported expectations that ECB could act to counter the deflationary threat as early as this week. But many investors expect the ECB will keep monetary policy unchanged. 
  The gains in euro over past 3 days have been modest. The problem is not underlying weakness in recent reports but rather an overall skepticism about how much impact these stronger numbers will have on the European Central Bank's economic outlook and monetary policy bias. 
  Due to dip in Germany's jobless rate and their larger than anticipated decline in unemployment rolls, the euro extended its gains against the U.S. dollar. 
  The positive surprises in German data are relatively new and have yet to cause investors to forget about last month's disappointments. Inflation remains extremely low making it impossible for the ECB to considering reducing stimulus at this time. 
  Positive sentiment for the Euro was also fuelled after the ECB Vice President, Vitor Constancio projected inflation rate in the region to bounce back in April, following a fall to 0.5% in March. Furthermore, he indicated that he did not see deflation prospects in the Euro-zone but at the same time warned that the economy could face a protracted period of low inflation, which could act as a drag on the region's economic recovery.

  The Indian rupee opened weaker at 60.35 levels after closing last week at 60.17 levels.The range for the day is seen between 60.20 ? 60.80 levels. 
  The Indian rupee posted its second consecutive weekly fall after data showed the trade deficit widened to a five-month high in March. The data reflected that the trade deficit inched up to $10.5 billion from $8.13 billion in February on the back of falling exports. The data again revived concerns about the current account deficit after a recent sharp narrowing. 
  Investors will now be closely eying the consumer inflation data due on today, as well as the start of corporate earnings results next week, for a better snapshot of the domestic economy. The government will release the data on wholesale prices on Tuesday around 0630 GMT. Consumer price data is due at 1200 GMT. 
  Inflation in India is expected to have edged up on higher food costs in March, snapping a three-month easing trend that will give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) less scope to support the economy amid fresh signs of slowdown. Analysts say the risk of less-than-normal monsoon rains this summer will call into question assumptions that the worst is over for Asia's third-largest economy. 
  The other big news is from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology last week predicted that the chance of an El Nino weather event developing in 2014 now exceeded 70 percent. According to the reports, a strong El Nino in India would trigger lower production of summer crops such as rice, sugarcane and oilseeds. In 2009, it had turned monsoon rains patchy, leading to the worst drought in nearly four decades which shot up annual food inflation to over 21 percent. 
  Such a scenario would further compound the challenges for the new government that takes over in New Delhi after national elections in May. 
  The Asian markets are trading mixed after upbeat U.S. data helped Wall Street bounce from a sharp selloff in recent days, though tensions in Ukraine tempered demand for riskier assets. 
  The encouraging retail sales from the world's biggest economy, which had been bogged down by a harsh winter, gave some respite to the investors. The dollar held steady after the solid U.S. retail sales data. The euro remained under pressure on weekend comments from European Central Bank officials, including ECB President Mario Draghi, who rekindled speculation about more easing in the euro zone. 
  Dollar Rupee is trading above 60.20 levels, a break above 60.40 levels on a consistent note could produce a fast rally towards 60.80 - 61.00 levels.

  The Euro is trading lower at 1.3816 levels after mixed sentiment seen arising over the pair. 
  The European policymakers putting downside pressure on the pair and the recent decline in U.S. yields providing upside support. Both of these forces are strong and significant enough to keep EUR/USD confined within a 1.36 to 1.40 trading range. 
  Based on the comments from ECB officials, European policymakers do not want to see the EUR/USD trade above 1.40 and if it gets there, the chance of ECB easing will skyrocket. 
  The central bank may not be serious about Quantitative Easing but they are very serious about talking down their currency. In fact Mario Draghi's comment that ""the strengthening of the exchange rate requires further monetary stimulus"" is one of the central bank's strongest warnings against a rising currency. 
  The policymakers have made it clear that QE is an option in theory, in reality they have a number of ways to ease monetary policy including a reduction in the refi or deposit rate, narrowing the interest rate corridor. If the currency pair resumes its rise above 1.39, we see an 80% chance of more stimulus in June.

  Sterling fell for three consecutive sessions but yesterday it managed to close almost at par with opening level of 1.3726. Despite positive economic report, the currency tends to react from global markets which were prone for risk aversion due to Ukraine tensions. 
  The only economic report on the docket was housing price index which soars to record levels indicating the healthy sign for the sector. 
  The strong housing sector and positive signal from other economic reports shows the economy is gaining momentum compare to last year where it was drowning in recession. 
  This shows that the central bank may consider starting tightening the policy rates, however so far they remained dovish since the inflation and wage prices are still under pressure. 
  In previous month, wage prices were at minimal and inflation below the target level which if continued will defer the policy tightening by the central bank, thus correction in the pair will remain imminent. 
  Apart from CPI, there are other secondary data are set to release which will also incorporate the trend of currency by traders. 
  GBPUSD: The Sterling traded within tight range of 47 pips in yesterday?s session before closing the day unchanged at 1.6726, thus forming Doji.

  The local unit opened significantly lower at 60.73, versus close of 60.55 yesterday.

  US equity markets went into a tailspin probably on market interpretation of Fed?s statements acknowledging inflation combined with the strong numbers on Q2 GDP. The market has interpreted this as a strong possibility that rate hikes could happen earlier, especially if the slack in the labor market were to improve. However ADP Employment numbers on Wednesday came in lower than expectation at 2, 15,000. Yesterday, the four week average of jobless claims dropped to 2, 97,250, the lowest since April 2006.

June's overall trade deficit was far smaller than what the government had assumed in its first snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product. That suggests the GDP growth estimate for the quarter could be revised up. 	 		In the later session, dollar eroded all its gain due to escalating geo political concerns of Russia and Ukraine which capped the gains of dollar and as such it declined and closed near its lows. This enabled market participants to rush for safe heaven. 	 		Russia will ban all imports of food from US and fruits and vegetable from EU which will be a response to the sanctions imposed by them over its support for rebels in Ukraine.

On economic front Halifax HPI m/m was released yesterday marking at 1.4% against -0.4% earlier. It is measured by change in prices of house financed by Halifax Bank of Scotland.

Manufacturing Production m/m registered at 0.3% against -1.3%, but was well below the market expectations of 0.7% which added pressure on Pound making it weak against dollar. Manufacturing production is a leading indicator of economic health as production reacts quickly to ups and downs in the business cycle and is correlated with consumer conditions such as employment levels and earning.

Other Markets   	 		India?s 10-year G-Sec -..Ten-year benchmark yield is steady at 8.62%, as rupee hit a five month low at 61.50 yesterday. In addition, Governor Rajan?s statement that the fiscal deficit of 4.1% in 2015, would be a difficult ask, is likely to support a higher yield. RBI completed a Rs 6000 crore auction of 364 day T bills and Rs 9000 crore auction of 91 day T bills at cut off yields of 8.74% and 8.64%.They also conducted a one -day reverse repo of Rs 2167 crores at a fixed rate of 7.00% and a one-day repo auction of Rs 20145 crores at a fixed rate of 8.00% under the Liquid Adjustment Facility. 	 		US Treasury Market -. Yields fell sharply with the ten year benchmark dropping to 2.43% before finally settling at 2.46% as tensions about Ukraine and Russian defiance in face of stringent sanctions, weighed on the markets. Though analysts agree that the possibility of an actual invasion of Ukraine is low, the sentiment remains risk averse with all safe haven assets showing a tick up, including bond yields across global markets. While data on US markets have been positive, with the trade deficit narrowing to 7%, the lowest since Jan 2014, investors are currently ignoring US growth and focusing on developments in Ukraine. 	 		Crude Oil-:..WTI Crude ticked down to $ 96.94 levels after ticking up slightly to $ 97.95 levels on geopolitical tensions and a general risk off sentiment. However today, the excess supplies is playing on the price, with the inventories report released by Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing that the stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma have gone to 18.0 million barrels, despite a draw down of 1.8 million barrels. Earlier in the week, the American Petroleum Institute in its report yesterday showed that the stocks were lower by 5.5 million barrels which was positive for prices. Brent too was trading at a 13 month low of $ 104.07 at yesterday. 	 		Gold-: Gold convincingly broke through the psychological level of $ 1300 to trade steady at $ 1306 on safe haven trade as concerns on Ukraine kept global stock markets pressured. Gold rose along with other safe haven trades such as yen and global bond yields. Prices are likely to be steady till the ECB and BOE meetings today.

  India?s 10-year G-Sec-: Government bonds gained for a third consecutive session on Tuesday to a more than one-week high, as strong demand at the government's auction of mobile airwaves is improving confidence about the country's finances. The benchmark yield dropped by 7 bps to the day?s low of 8.67 percent yesterday. The government is scheduled to sell 100 billion rupees ($1.60 billion) worth of bonds on Friday, potentially the last debt sale in the current financial year as the government has received higher-than-budgeted revenues through small savings. In the current session the yield is trading at 8.71 percent. As far as liquidity is concerned, a total of 27 banks bid for a total of Rs. 20947 crores today. 
  US Treasury Market -: Rebound in risk appetite aided bond yields to gain from three month lows with 10 year bond yield upped by 5 bps to 2.63 percent. Investors are bracing for job report schedule later this week, after poor manufacturing report is blamed for recent economic weakness. And any poor number will shift the Fed stance from withdraw of QE. Also, the government is most likely to reinstate the limit on borrowing later this week as they could use accounting measures to do the same till end of the month. In the meantime, issuance of short term debt is been restricted which might add pressure to the bills that are most at risk of delayed payments. Thus mix of events could keep cautious investors to take a call before entering into the market. 
  Crude Oil-: WTI Oil price remain steady with a firm note at $97.70 as US is gripped with cold bolstering the demand for fuel. Also, recovery in equities is supporting the prices. But Brent oil remained lower on concerns over recovery in emerging markets. Inventory data is lined up today, where it is expected to print lower which shows that stronger demand in the world?s biggest economy. While on supply it has eased the delivery has been eased from Gulf coast as well as the start-up of TransCanada?s Keystone south pipeline which should even out supply demand balance overall in near term. 
  Gold-: The week was astounding to gain by more than a percent; however recovery in equities and dollar strength has capped further upside for Gold. Today, the price fell for second day but trading in tight range of $4 amid weak demand from Asian markets as the Chinese markets are shut for the Lunar New Year holiday which weighed on volumes. Earlier the gains in the price were due to weaker data from US, nevertheless the price has added nearly 5 percent since start of 2014. The top buyer, China has been weak on physical front on New Year which has kept the price in range bound. NFP the barometer of US remains watchful to define the price in near term.

  There was dollar gained strength across the board while US indices declined yesterday. DXY index marked two day low of 80.08 levels in early sessions while in later sessions posted nine day high of 80.70 levels against basket of six major currencies yesterday. 
  Majorly economic releases surpassed expectations but failed to beat earlier figures creating mixed picture which left investors clueless. S&P 500 plunged by 0.89 percent followed by Dow Jones Industrial Average edging down by 0.82 percent and lastly NASDAQ declined by 0.80 percent. 
  ISM Manufacturing PMI stood better than expectations to mark levels of 57.0 against 57.3 reported earlier. Data release indicated that components like prices paid, new orders, supplier deliveries and employment surged higher while inventories components declined with production component remaining moderate. 
  Construction Spending surged higher to post release of 1.0 percent against 0.9 percent earlier. Insights to above release projected that rise was majorly due to spike in private construction spending reflecting increase in both residential and non residential investments while in sheer contrast Public Construction Spending declined.  
  Unemployment Claims registered 339K against 341K of previous month. Though the release was better than expectations but failed to mark figures better than previous reading as mixed set of releases continue further.

  The continued buying pressures make the local unit to break the range. It opened at 62.35 levels after closing at 62.26 levels. 
  The Indian rupee fell to a two-week low yesterday, posting a second consecutive decline, hurt by the biggest falls in stocks in six weeks and dollar demand from a large corporate. The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index PMI fell to 50.7 in December from 51.3 in the previous month.  
  The weak start to the year comes ahead of key events later this month, including inflation data due mid-month that will help determine whether the Reserve Bank of India raises interest rates at its policy review on Jan. 28. 
  The RBI has made clear it could resume tightening monetary policy after two rate hikes last year even as economic growth slows. Good and consistent demand from state-run banks may be on account of genuine oil demand, and a fall in equities also exerted pressure on the local unit. 
  The dollar index regaining the strength could take rupee under some pressure, it is trading steady near a two-week high after positive U.S. economic data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to step away from its bond buying stimulus. 
  The US 10 year bond yields have risen above psychologically important 3% and there is nearly a consensus on long-term interest rates in US to rise further this year. This should attract investors to dollar bonds thus strengthening US Dollar in 2014. 
  The Yield differential has been a major driver for currencies historically and a recent spike in US yield lead to a huge outflows from Indian Debt market. If the trend continues the local debt market could again come under pressure again hurting the local unit. Accordingly, one should closely watch the movements in US bond yields and in US Dollar; we expect rise in both in coming months. Further, there are instances of dollar strengthening in the first half of the year. This is specially driven by optimism about US growth outpacing growth elsewhere; hence money pulls back to homeland. 
  In the chart below, except in 2011, US dollar has strengthened in the first half. We expect US Dollar index to try 85 levels by mid of the year.. This also means that Rupee, which has benefited from FCNR swap flows till last Dec end, could come under pressure as well. Along with we also have short term debt of USD 173 billion maturing in March 2014.  
 USDINR: Technically, USDINR still waits for a major break out, which could be concluded on a consistent move. The days closing would hint for the coming week a weekly closing above 62.35 levels would limit the gains seen earlier, a closing below it will still open the doors for 62.00 below levels.

The IIP data and trade deficit data is due during the day, which would further hint on the movement of the local unit. The intraday range for the rupee is seen between 61.80 ? 62.20 levels. 
  The Indian rupee ended little changed at 62.07 on Thursday after hitting a one-week high earlier in the session, as dollar sales by foreign investors looking to invest in debt were offset by a negative session in the local stock market. 
  As per the market participant India's inflation rate will probably ease in December from stubbornly high levels, helped by waning food prices providing some respite to the Reserve Bank of India which has been struggling with cost pressures and slow growth. 
  The Foreign Institutional investors have turned net buyers of over $850 million worth of bonds in December after a six month lull; have so far in 2014 purchased a net $215.50 million. Debt related inflows were also seen on Thursday.

In equities, foreign buying has decreased with investors having bought only a net $60.70 million so far this month, after purchasing over $20 billion in 2013.

  The U.S. dollar eased from a seven-week high early on Friday as investors booked some profits ahead of the keenly awaited U.S. jobs report, helping lift the euro that was briefly unsettled by dovish comments from the European Central Bank. 
  The main takeaway from European Central Bank meeting is that low inflation and the volatility in money market rates are becoming a bigger headache for the central bank.  
  While the ECB left interest rates unchanged, the euro sold off when central bank President Draghi said they strengthened their forward guidance. In addition to saying that ""interest rates will remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,"" Draghi warned that they would ""act if the inflation outlook worsened"" or ""money markets tightened."" 
  However the currency pair bounced off its lows after investors realized that the central bank has grown more serious about dropping interest rates below zero. Draghi said all policy tools are at their disposal and they stand ready to act if needed but right now they are comfortable with the current level of monetary policy.  
 USDINR: In daily chart the 11 day EMA is seen crossing from above the 55 day EMA, in case the cross over completes and move towards to cross 21 day EMA then we can see a strong selling coming in. The SAR parabolic is also indicating a sell signal with its first dot appeared on the day?s candle. It at least signifies that for a while the selling could persist in the market and dollar should be sold on rallies

  The Indian Rupee opened slight weaker at 61.67 levels after closing at 61.53 levels on Monday. The intraday range is seen between 61.40 ? 61.75 levels. 
  The local unit rose to its highest level in over a month on Monday, boosted by hefty gains in domestic shares and after weaker than-expected U.S. jobs data eased worries about an aggressive reduction in the Federal Reserve's stimulus. 
  The local unit rosed to 61.41 during the session, it?s strongest since Dec. 11. The unit rose 0.55 percent on day, its biggest single-day gain since Dec. 16. 
  India's retail inflation (CPI) in December eased to a three-month low as vegetable prices fell, giving some relief to policymakers struggling to contain price pressures as growth hovers at a decade low. Retail prices rose an annual 9.87 percent last month, slower than the 9.92 percent expected by economists. 
  The moderation was largely driven by a fall in vegetable prices, which cooled nearly 19 percent from November on improved supplies. That helped slow down annual food inflation to 12.16 percent last month from 14.72 percent in November 
  India will release December's wholesale price index-based inflation data a day later on January 15. 
  A fall in inflation could raise expectations the Reserve Bank of India would keep monetary policy on hold for a second consecutive month on Jan. 28 after data on Friday showed a surprise fall in industrial output. 
  With economic data, the foreign fund flows into the domestic share market will continue to be key for the rupee's fortunes. 
  With some improvement seen in the economy, the current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to decline by over 40% for fiscal 2013-14. Trade deficit that is down over 20% on the back of rising exports and falling imports is helping the CAD come off. Falling CAD is positive for the rupee that has gained 10% from lows against the dollar. 
  The Reserve Bank of India decided to grant more flexibility for hedging foreign exchange exposures, by relaxing rules for cancellation and rebooking forward contracts. 
  In a notification on Monday, the central bank said that it would allow forward contracts in respect of all current account transactions as well as capital account transactions with a residual maturity of one year or less to be freely cancelled anrebooked. 
  The forward contracts booked by FIIs/QFIs/other portfolio investors that were once cancelled could be rebooked up to the extent of 10% of the value of the contracts cancelled. However, the forward contracts booked by these investors may be rolled over on or before maturity. 
  Previous rules had prohibited the facility of cancellation and rebooking for forward contracts, involving rupee as one of the currencies, booked by residents to hedge current and capital account transactions. 
  Earlier, the exporters were allowed to cancel and rebook forward contracts up to 50% of the contracts booked in a financial year for hedging their contracted export exposures, whereas importers could cancel and rebook forward contracts not exceeding 25% of the contracts booked in a financial year. 
 USD/INR: With VIX continues to drop down, the volatility would be in control for a while. As mentioned earlier, upticks should be seen to sell for exporters while importers should not go aggressive for buying, partial buying on key support area makes sense. Looking further there are chances of rupee retesting the previous low of 61.10 or below levels. It?s the retracement level of the previous major rally from 55 ? 68.85 levels. Market was seen taking support from the same levels, if market breaks these levels on a consistent note then we can see a fair rally of rupee appreciation.

  The Indian Rupee opened weaker at 61.41 levels after closing yesterday at 61.17 levels. The range for the day is seen between 61.20 ? 61.65 levels. 
  The Indian rupee rose slightly yesterday, snapping a two-day losing streak, as a sharper-than-expected fall in retail inflation and a slight expansion in industrial output reinforced optimism the domestic economy was on the mend. Still, broader gains were capped as much of the positive news is seen to be priced in, given the rupee is trading at around seven-month highs, while traders preferred to wait and watch ahead of wholesale price inflation data, due on Friday. 
  The FII?s flows have been quite robust in last few sessions totaling the net inflow to more than USD 7 billion. The Foreign investors have bought net USD 1.08 billion and USD 5.98 billion in debt till year. 
  India imported about 36 percent less oil from Iran in February than in January, because of efforts to meet U.S. requests to restrict purchases from Tehran to 195,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the six months to July 20, data from trade sources showed. 
  The Asian stocks are trading lower as heightened tension in Ukraine ahead of a weekend referendum prompted investors to shed riskier assets. Safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc and the yen are in demand having surged overnight as tensions in Ukraine flared up and worries about the health of the Chinese economy continued to fester. 
  It fell with a regional gauge set for the biggest weekly slump since June, gold climbed and copper fluctuated on concern China?s economy is faltering. Along with the slowdown in China and uncertainty in the Ukraine contributed to the liquidation and profit taking. There is also no coincidence that the rally in stocks stalled near record highs and the rally in EUR/USD stopped at a very significant technical resistance level. 
  The US central bank officials made it clear that a significant deterioration in the economic outlook would be needed to change the course the course of tapering.So unless retail sales fell by 1.5% or more, we can expect another $10 billion reduction in monthly bond purchases. Thankfully reducing stimulus won't be a tough decision for Janet Yellen next week. 
  Expectations for a continued normalization of monetary policy should limit losses for the greenback. Producer prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey is scheduled for release today and based on yesterday's economic reports, we expect slightly stronger numbers. 
  The Rupee is trading weaker on account of global concern. It is also seen sustaining above 61.00 levels and a weekly close above it could make it to inch up higher around 61.70 - 61.90 levels. Exporters should sell for next few weeks on the upticks seen and importers keeping on up-ticks or at stop losses.

  No major top story from financial market has helped sentiment to continue for dollar strengthening across the board. The recent rally is largely attributed to fall in major currencies since their respective bond yields decline, thus weighing back towards dollar for higher return. 
  Dollar index marked 4 week high of 80.58 to end again near the days high at 80.55. Sterling declined sharply by nearly 100 pips, with lower yields weighed USDJPY, Euro marked 3 ½ month low, commodity currencies stayed lower and Gold made another fresh three month low. 
  Globally, the volumes have fallen sharply in forex market with volatility halving as investors are yet unable to get clear indication of the central bank policy actions. 
  Speaking of equities, the indices hit new record high in yesterday?s session but later it lost its momentum to end the day in negative territory. Dow closed lower by 0.25%, S&P fell from the record high but managed to stay above the psychological level of 1900 at 1909.76 and Nasdaq ended down at 4225.07. 
  Today bout of economic reports are set to release such as revisions to Q1 GDP, jobless claims and pending home sales and another positive numbers could certainly drive dollar higher but any softness will keep both yields and dollar lower. 
  DXY: Dollar index continues to move in a positive direction by crossing its previous pivot high of 80.47 on closing basis. The index continues to move in a rising channel. Prices have crossed the barrier of 61.8% retracement of the previous fall from 81.38-78.90 and can now move up till 80% retracement which comes to 81.00 levels. MACD and RSI continue to give positive indications with no signal of reversal or slow down of momentum. Thus support of 80.30 should be held for the day while surpass of previous day high could lead for another upward momentum till 80.78.

  Asian indices are trading mixed ahead of series of economic reports from the largest economy, plus tensions between China and Vietnam on border dispute has shed investors to stay away from riskier assets. Dollar across the board is marginally higher across the board, however it has not impacted much on Indian rupee so far.

  Surprisingly, Dollar rallied across the board even though Federal Reserve did not alter the monetary policy with minor change in statement and further few economic numbers too came out but they were not that encouraging. Dollar gained with the index marking high of 79.90 levels, bond yields too surged and equities sold off. 
  The winning streak for the US bourses ended yesterday as negative reaction weighed on markets after Fed decided to hold on the asset purchase program; however the selling pressure in equities were largely subdued. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 ended the session lower by 0.39% and 0.49% while the NASDAQ plunged 0.55%. 
  The FOMC maintained its current asset purchase program unchanged and holding funds target was held in the 0.00% to 0.25% range. The Fed will continue purchasing Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. 
  However, the key surprise element was the upbeat assessment of the economy from the central bank. The statement said that though the unemployment rate remains elevated and numbers coming are not satisfactory, they feel that conditions in all districts have improved. The committee reiterated that though inflation is persistently below its 2% target it will move back toward its target level over the medium term. More or less the tone was similar to previous meeting hence financial markets did not respond accordingly. 
  The other data releases included the release of ADP employment report that showed the private sector added 130K jobs in October, missing forecasts for 150K. Small industries have remained major contributor to employment figures in recent times with dip in their figures future outlook for employment looks less optimistic. The consumer prices (CPI) rose 0.2% in September because of higher costs of medical care, shelter and all forms of fuel. The core CPI rose a modest 0.1%. 
  The Asian equities have staged declines taking cues from its western counterparts. The Hang Seng has dropped 0.47% while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.61% along with KOSPI that plummeted 1.43%. The Nikkei is trading lower at 1.20%. 
  Further directions in the dollar index for today will depend on Federal Budget Balance, Treasury Sec Lew, Weekly Unemployment Claims and speech from Treasury Secretary Lew. 
 
 DXY: The index ended the previous session on a positive note closing at 79.79 levels after posting a two week high of 79.90 as expected to test our resistance levels.

  The Rupee gave a weaker opening at 61.36 levels compared to yesterday?s close of 61.23 levels tracking broad based dollar strength in the markets and losses in some of its Asian currency peers as FED kept the tap of Bond buying programme open and did not comment as to when they would commence the tapering. 
  The Indian equity indices opened today?s session on a flatter note amidst weak global cues. The Sensex is currently trading higher by 43 points at 21,077 levels while the Nifty has surged by 10 points to 6,262 levels. 
  On a separate note, the Kirit Parikh panel's report on pricing of petroleum products has recommended to immediately hike prices of diesel by Rs 5 a litre, kerosene by Rs 4 per litre and cooking gas by Rs 250 per cylinder. However, the implementation of the recommendation is unlikely immediately due to general elections ahead. 
  After two rate hikes in less than six weeks aimed at curbing inflation, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said the central bank may be done with interest rate increases as their impact on the economy is assessed. ?We think we have done enough (on rate hikes) given what we know about the economy to wait and watch and see what happens,? Rajan told analysts in a customary post policy conference call. 
  On the rupee, Rajan said he would consider the local currency to be stable only when dollar demand from oil companies returns to the market. Oil companies currently have a special swap window provided by the central bank to meet their dollar requirements, a facility that Rajan said would be tapered gradually. 
  The Rupee will look for cues from movements in domestic equities and the fiscal deficit data for the day.

  Speaking of data releases, the German consumer price inflation fell unexpectedly to 0.2% in September from 0.0% in the preceding month. Also, the number of jobless people in Germany rose for a third month in October by 2K to 2.4 Mn, adding to signs of a slowdown in Europe?s largest economy. 
  On a positive side, Spain ended its two-year recession with 0.1% growth in the July-to-September period from negative 0.1% previously supported by increasing number of exports that lifted growth, with a boost to the tourist industry.

  The pair also took a beating ahead of the crucial Manufacturing PMI release tomorrow which had registered a decline in the previous month and is expected to decline for this month as well. Dismal manufacturing data casts doubts over the growth of Britain?s economy which has shown impeccable growth in the past few months. 
  Nationwide HPI is the only data release lined up from the UK economy today which is expected to show a decline from 0.9% in August to 0.7% in September. 
 
 GBP/ USD: The pair has broken the rising trend line support and is acting as immediate resistance for 1.6057 levels. A break of this level will take the pair to test 1.6120 levels (Horizontal trend line). The downside in the pair has been confirmed by the RSI, Stochastic Slow and MACD all of which are showing negativity in the daily chart. The support for the pair will be seen at 1.5912(55-day EMA).

  US Treasury Market: The benchmark ten-year yields ended yesterday?s session lower by 2 basis points to end the day 2.48%.

  Crude Oil-: WTI Crude Oil is trading lower by 0.09% to $96.68 levels in today?s session. WTI Crude has been on a downward spiral journey since October and has plunged from $101 to $96 in this month. The fall is largely attributed to the rise in crude oil inventories which gained for a sixth week in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer. Crude inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels to 383.9 million last week, data from the Energy Information Administration yesterday surpassing expectations of a climb by 2.4 million. Adding to the negative sentiment was that Libya will resume oil production on one of its biggest oil fields by next week. 
  Gold-: The yellow metal lost its sheen in the previous session and is currently trading lower by 0.58% at $1336 levels after the Fed decided to maintain the stimulus package. The policy statement was also accommodative and shoved the tapering concerns to next year. The prices in the previous session plunged to $1334 levels due to profit booking. Meanwhile, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive session yesterday, thereby limiting the losses.

  Dearth of data releases from the US economy left the markets looking on for clues from the Fed officials for hints about the timing of tapering the QE programme. Though the Euro stayed in the 1.34 range in gained modestly, while the commodity currencies extended their losses. The dollar index continued to trade in narrow range of 46 points. 
  The US indices ended the five week winning streak and posted modest losses. S&P500 led the losses in the bourses by shedding 0.24% while the DJIA edged lower by 0.21%. NASDAQ was unchanged at 0.00%, respectively. 
  Fed officials Lockhart and Fisher seemed to adopt a moderately hawkish stance as the former stated that the central bank could begin the taper at its December meeting although he did say policy should remain very easy while the latter said the QE cannot continue forever. Contradicting to the above, Kocherlakota supported the Fed in maintaining the accommodative policy. Overall, the comments proved to be puzzling the markets over the timing of the tapering due to diverging views from the officials. 
  The most watched out Third Plenum meeting in China disappointed the market as the meeting was short on specifics that left the investors clinging onto loose ends. 
  Though China?s leaders pledged to enact fiscal and land reform, relax investment controls and let the market play a ?decisive? role in allocating resources. They also said the Communist Party's hand needs to stay strong. Instead of giving a clear direction for the economy the party signalled a difficult road ahead for economic reforms. 
  The Asian bourses plunged in today?s session taking cues from the Chinese reforms. The Nikkei fell 0.38% followed by KOSPI that dropped 1.28% while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.88%. The Hang Seng has shed 1.39%. 
  Looking ahead, Federal Budget Balance is the only release from the US economy today. 
 
 DXY: DXY Index slipped past its 200-day EMA and is hovering above the 100-day EMA at 81.11 levels. As mentioned in our previous report, neutral view is maintained on the index for today as well as daily stochastic is showing flat movement while, the RSI has flattened out above the neutrality zone.

  The bear run for the Indian Rupee continued as it opened weaker at 63.90 levels today tracking weakness in the Asian peers and partly due to dismal domestic data. It is currently trading at 63.58. 
  The Indian equity indices opened today's session in the negative terrain following the disappointing CPI and IIP release. Sensex is trading lower by 15 points to 20,270 while Nifty has edged down 7 points to 6,011. 
  On the domestic front, both the CPI and the IIP releases disappointed the markets. The IIP data September printed 2% YoY below the expectations of 3.5% YoY although it came higher than the previous month's release of 0.6%. Within the IIP, the manufacturing failed to instill any confidence about a sustainable recovery as it printed 0.6% YoY. The mining sector growth stood at 3.3% YoY versus -2.5% previously. The Electricity sector on the other hand stands out with a stellar performance of 12.9% YoY in September as against -0.2% YoY earlier 
  The Consumer Price index sent another shock wave in the market by surging 10.09% for October from 9.84 % in September, driven by food prices. The food inflation surged to an 8-month high of 12.3% YoY on record high vegetables inflation of 45.7% YoY. 
  Quickening CPI inflation figures have reignited concerns of a rate hike by 25 bps from the RBI in December meeting. 
  Looking ahead, the Rupee will take cues from the international as well as domestic events for the day. 
 
 USD/ INR: Since morning the pair has moved in a narrow range of 30 paisa. Bearish bias is held for the Rupee as the RSI and MACD both indicate further room for depreciation. As mentioned in our previous report, support for the Rupee is seen at 62.57 levels (61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the low of 59.09 to high of68.84) while crucial resistance is seen at 64.00 (Psychological level) .

  The Euro extended gains in the previous session after its appeal increased as Fed officials provided mixed comments on the QE shrugging off weak regional data. 
  On the data front, Germany's annual CPI slowed to 1.2% in October, in line with expectations though it was still at its lowest level in more than three years and also down from 1.4% in September. 
  The data added to concerns over growing deflationary pressures in the euro area, after the annual rate of inflation across the euro zone slowed to a four year low of 0.7% in October. 
  In the meanwhile, ECB's Nowotny and Asmussen reiterated that that there was room for the Central Bank to reduce rates further. 
  Investors keenly await the release of Euro-zone's industrial production data, which is broadly expected to stay flat in September, compared to a 2.1% fall seen in August. 
 
 EUR/USD: The Euro ended the previous session on a positive note closing at 1.3436 while marking an intraday high of 1.3456. The pair is currently hovering at 1.3436 levels. The daily RSI is pointing higher, while the daily MACD line has stayed below its signal line. Based on this, the pair is expected to trade with neutral bias.

  The pound came under pressure after data showed October inflation came in at 2.2%, below expectations and also down from 2.7% in September. The lower inflation has prompted investors to re-think over the expectations that the Bank of England might hike interest rates sooner than the bank?s forward guidance from August indicated. 
  Separately, the core inflation rate, which is stripped of volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco items, slowed to 1.7% year-on-year, the lowest increase since September 2009 and well below September's 2.2% rate and expectations for a 2.0% rate. 
  Meanwhile, the retail price index rose 2.6% in October, below forecasts for a 3.0% increase after rising 3.2% in September. 
  For today, the pound might get a lift if the BoE brings forward the point at which it sees UK unemployment hitting 7% the level at which it would consider raising rates, though a fall in inflation could give the central bank leeway to wait longer. 
  The central bank's inflation report is expected today, with investors watching for any changes in unemployment forecasts or estimates for when the country could reach its 7% unemployment threshold. The retail price index rose 2.6% in October, below forecasts for a 3.0% increase after rising 3.2% in September.

Technically, the WTI will find support at $94.00 and resistance at $95.50.

Data release indicated that consumers were less optimistic about the short term outlook as 'expectations for six months' component inched lower along with present situation component. Second consecutive decline in consumer confidence was majorly due to the fiscal uncertainty in largest economy.

  The Indian rupee closed unchanged yesterday at 62.51 levels after trading slightly stronger for most of the session helped by dollar inflows in the local market and slight weakness in dollar index. The dollar continued to perform well against the commodity currencies but is struggling to hold onto its gains versus the euro, British pound and Japanese Yen. 
  Rupee this morning opened positive at 62.45 levels, and is expected to trade in the range of 62.20 - 62.60 levels for the day. As mentioned yesterday the near term range is seen between 62-63 levels. Any consistent break towards any side would further direct the move of the local unit. 
  The positive news for the day is that the India's economic growth is expected to pick up slightly in the July-September quarter as improved manufacturing activity steered it from a four-year low in the previous three months. A moderate recovery in Indian factories and exports were probably the main drivers for an increase in overall growth in the quarter through September. Annual industrial output picked up 2 percent in September, driven by an uptick in export and domestic orders. 
  With wholesale price inflation moving back above the Reserve Bank of India's perceived comfort level of 5 percent and consumer inflation quickening to more than 10 percent, there is little expectation the central bank will act to ease policy boost growth. 
  A lot as has been said after US-Iran deal, that it would be highly positive for India. Definitely it would be helpful for India, but don't forget with positive you have some cons as well. Till recently, India would buy oil from Iran, and pay 55% in foreign currency, and 45% in rupees. If trading restrictions are removed by the US or EU, it stands that the Iran will undertake business on a competitive basis. 
  This will further impact the exports of Indian basmati rice against aromatic varieties of Thailand and Pakistan. Soymeal, corn, and raw sugar will meet the challenge of South American and Black Sea prices. India would not be alone to offer Iran agro products, the lists of competitors are huge and some have the immense potential to grab the deals from India?s basket. 
 
 
 USD/INR: The positives are frontline news but the derailment of the rupee-for-oil deal with Iran is the biggest threat for India. Without that, there's an additional $5 billion of outflow expected to Iran, which, if not paid in rupees, will have to be paid pack in dollars.As of now there are some small dollar inflows which are helping the rupee and off-setting the month-end demand for dollars. We would continue to see dips around 61.80-62.00 levels where we can see oil firms coming up to buy dollars. Importers keep on buying around dips i.e. 62.20 - 62.25 levels, while exporters can hold for covering next year?s exposures. Intraday exports could be sold around 62.50 levels.

  The Indian rupee rose to a one-week high yesterday helped by gains in the euro and weakness in dollar index. Rupee is expected to trade in the narrow range of 62.20 - 62.60 levels, while for near term we see the range of 61.80 - 63.00 levels. 
  The Indian GDP data is due for tomorrow with expectation of economic growth likely picked up slightly in the July-September quarter as improved manufacturing activity steered it from a four-year low in the previous three months. If the spur of data's reflects positive then we can see rupee continuing its positive move in next week as well. 
  In its effort to support manufacturing activity, the Reserve Bank of India allowed banks to treat loans given to medium manufacturing enterprises after November 13 as priority sector advance, in its efforts to provide enhanced liquidity support to the medium and small enterprises. 
  The RBI also allowed incremental bank loans to medium services enterprises extended after November 13 to up to 100 million rupees and raised the loan limit given to micro and small service enterprises to 100 million rupees from 50 million rupees that will be treated as priority sector advance. This facility will remain open till March 31, 2014. 
  The Indian Cabinet is likely to take a decision today on relaxing FDI norms for the housing sector and reducing foreign investment limit to 49 percent in rare and critical areas of the pharma segment. The Cabinet would also deliberate on the stand to be taken by India in the forthcoming WTO meet in Bali between 3rd - 6th December. 
  With this development in local market the investors would continue to monitor global dollar and euro moves for further directions. The Euro hit its highest in four years against the yen and rose versus the dollar on after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives reached a deal with the Social Democrats on forming a grand coalition. 
  The dollar extended its losses against the euro and British pound but continued to trade higher against the Japanese Yen and commodity currencies. The lack of consistency in the performance of the greenback this week has not changed, reflecting the impact of relative growth and divergent monetary policy direction on currency flows. 
 
 USD/INR: Throughout the week, this divergence has widened, driving many currency pairs to multiyear highs as investors pile into European currencies and dump commodity currencies. With U.S. markets closed on today so the volume in the FX market is expected to decline. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economy probably will grow more slowly next year than some forecasters predict and indicated that a record U.S. stock market isn't in a bubble. For the day, Importers can eye to buy around 62.20 - 62.25 levels, while exporters should sell on rallies for near term exposure. The market is juggling between 62 - 63 levels, which is also seen a comfort range for RBI. Any further news/events from both local and international would be important to watch.

  On Friday, Personal spending came at -0.1% against 0.4% earlier falling unexpectedly even if the employment numbers continue to impress the analyst. The fall in consumer spending is due to Household purchase which decreased. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, has been held back by tight credit and meager wage growth that is barely able to keep up with inflation.

  The local unit opened steady at 60.50 against a close of 60.5150 on Thursday. Most Asian equities are in green, in the hope that Chinese government will go ahead with additional stimulus after the HSBC Chinese PMI came in weaker at 51.1 and the manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.2 against a reading of 50.3 earlier.

  On Friday, US Stocks ended higher ahead of the Labour day weekend with the S&P 500 closing above 2000 for the third time this week. But the dollar really strengthened on a weaker Euro, as a poor inflation number at 0.3% (against a previous reading of 0.4%) as well as a weak retail sales number in Germany and even problems in Finland on account of Ukraine tensions. In fact Ukraine tensions drove down the Euro to an all time low of$1.3126, ahead of the ECB meeting this week. In contrast, the numbers out of the UK continue to remain strong, with housing prices showing resilience as the BoE Governor Carney continues to indicate lower interest rates going ahead. 
  Meanwhile in Asia, Japan?s household spending came in much lower than expectations, though data on factory orders showed that businesses spent in this quarter. But the anti corruption drive in China continues to impact growth in Hong Kong. While the Nikeii is up after two days of profit booking last week, Asian stocks are mixed. In early trade, the Sensex is up 170 points and the Nifty trades at record 8008 levels. 
  In domestic news, the Indian economy expanded 5.7%, the highest in nine quarters against a reading of 4.6% earlier. In an interview with the media, the Central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan also reiterated that India today is in a much better position to handle interest rate increases in the US on account of the upturn in economic activity here. FII investment in India has meanwhile crossed the $30 billion mark, with a $17 billion investment in debt and the rest in equity.

  Technically speaking, USDINR is moving in a range of 60.40-60.70 levels. On Thursday it went up and made a high of 60.70 levels on Ukraine crisis but closed at 60.5150 levels which clearly suggest that it was a whipsaw. There is some good buying by state run banks below 60.40 levels while FII?s are sellers at allhigher levels. The pair if has to move till 61.00 levels, it needs to close above 60.62 levels and sustain above it. Failure to do so will enable this pair to stay in a range of 60.40-60.60 levels.

Maruti Gujarat plans: Will small investors be shortchanged?,"{""Maruti Gujarat"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/marutis-gujarat-plans-will-small-investors-be-shortchanged/articleshow/29500510.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maruti's Gujarat plans: Will small investors be shortchanged?,"MUMBAI: Shares of auto major Maruti Suzuki plunged in trade today after its board approved the parent company’s decision to set up a separate 100 per cent subsidiary. 

 Maruti Suzuki would enter into a contract with this subsidiary under which all production in the subsidiary company would be in accordance with the requirements of MSIL and the vehicles would be sold to MSIL, Maruti Suzuki said in the filing with the BSE. MSIL will continue to pay royalty to the parent company. 

 This has raised corporate governance concerns in the company as experts are of the view that small investors will be shortchanged. 

 
Following are the views of brokerages and experts on the company’s decision: 

 
Kotak Securities: 

 The stock has tanked post announcement of Gujarat expansion. Suzuki will do contract manufacturing for Maruti Suzuki at the Gujarat plant which implies Maruti will not put any capex in the Gujarat plant and will give contract manufacturing income and cash to cover incremental capital expenditure to Suzuki. 

 This implies that contribution margin on the sale of vehicles from Gujarat will be significantly lower than current margins but return ratio will be higher given no capex by Maruti Suzuki. 

 
UBS: 

 Maruti has decided to pursue Gujarat expansion through a 100 per cent Suzuki subsidiary. The subsidiary would be a manufacturing company with Maruti as its only customer. 

 This is again likely to create an issue of corporate governance and relationship with the parent. 

 It is likely that most of the future exports could be pursued through this Gujarat plant and Maruti may make only the marketing margin. 

 
Anil Singhvi, Chairman, Ican Investment 

 It is absurd to say the least because Maruti board and even Suzuki for that matter should not stoop down to that level. This is short-changing minority shareholders in India. We have seen these kind of abuses being committed by MNCs and Suzuki should have realised more than anyone else that Maruti has been one of the biggest successes of Suzuki. 

 Why do they want to let this profitable company go through this kind of hurdles? What is the Maruti board doing on this? How can they allow this? 

 This is complete fraud actually. This is where I believe that Indian board should rise above these petty considerations and raise their voice to the parents. 

 
Silky Jain, Research Analyst, Nirmal Bang 

 The response which we have got is completely negative. We were not expecting this thing to happen and so the stock has also reacted negatively. We do not see it perform in the near term but then downside is capped. 

 The stock ended at Rs 1,563.20, down 8.12 per cent, on the BSE. It touched a high of Rs 1,750.10 and a low of Rs 1,541.25 in trade today. 

 Clarity on the subsidiary issue will emerge after the concall. Brokerages are expected to a fresh- take on the stock post that.

 Since early March when the rift between the Maruti management and non-promoter shareholders first drew media attention, the stock price has climbed 18 per cent to Rs 1,868, from Rs 1,580. However, none of the large shareholders have sold a single share. 

 While it’s a widely shared perception that the Suzuki proposal is a raw deal for minority shareholders, one wonders whether a few of them are sensing this as an opportunity to push the company to dip into its cash reserve of more than Rs 3,500 crore to come out with a buyback offer.

Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: What is the call that you are making on the index as well as stock specific strategies? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: On the index, I remain positive but again, it is basically a market which is slightly overbought. So one of these days and it appears that today afternoon, we could have had some kind of profit booking. The market might consolidate after hitting newer highs but one of these days, that kind of price movement is expected to happen but for the time being, the trend is firmly on the upside. So you are broadly carrying about a 100-point kind of risk but overall, this is a market which is poised to go much higher from current levels.
 
 The CNX IT, which was for the last four-five days not really participating but more of consolidating sideways, has started to pick up and if that can contribute along with the Bank Nifty, we should see 9000 being hit fairly fast. That does appear to be the kind of scenario and any kind of decline of 70-80 points on intraday basis or a one-two-day kind of pullback should be used to possibly add onto long positions.

 MaKE Ltd, the holding company of Kaya Ltd, owns and operates 86 Kaya Skin clinics in 26 cities in India, the company said in a BSE filing. 

 Commenting on the announcement, MaKE Ltd Chairman and Whole-Time Director Harsh Mariwala said: ""MaKE being listed independently reflects the beginning of a new journey for Kaya. We believe that Kaya has a distinct potential to create value as an emerging specialised skincare business."" 

 In January last year, Marico had announced plans to demerge Kaya into a separate entity and list it independently on bourses as part of the company's business restructuring process. 

 ""The company strongly believes that for the next phase of its value creation journey, the Kaya business should be run in an entrepreneurial manner independently from the FMCG business of Marico,"" the company had said in a statement while announcing its plans for demerger. 

 The restructuring will bring sharper focus across both the consumer goods and cosmetic services businesses of the company, it added.

US Generic launches are key to Lupin growth,"{""Lupin"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/us-generic-launches-are-key-to-lupin-growth/articleshow/46118219.cms,m.economictimes.com,US Generic launches are key to Lupin growth,"Lupin, one of the most consistent performers in the pharma sector, reported lower-than-expected revenue growth for the third quarter due to sluggishness in its overseas businesses. However, given a strong pipeline of new drug applications and a diversified geographical presence, the company's long-term prospects look strong. This could be a major reason why its stock did not react sharply on Tuesday despite depressed growth numbers. 

 Lupin's revenue grew 5% yearon-year to Rs 3,144.9 crore during the December 2014 quarter, much lower than the analysts' expectation of 12-14% growth. However, lower raw material costs pushed the operating margin up 200 basis points to 28%. 

 A high base effect characterised by three material drug launches in the US in the third quarter of the last fiscal and delay in drug approvals curtailed the US business growth to 4%.The US business is the largest product segment contributing nearly half of the company's consolidated revenues. For the nine months ended December, the US business grew 24%. 

 With the management expecting growth of 15-20% in the US business for the fiscal, the subdued show in the US seems to be an aberration. The domestic business, constituting one-fourth of the revenue, continued to gain from the low-base effect and recent recovery in volumes.
 
 Lupin's Japan business was impacted by a mix of factors such as yen depreciation and changing market dynamics. With pressures on cost, small players don't have it easy.Being the eighth-largest generic company, Lupin has its fair share of challenges to overcome. 

 In the forthcoming quarters, key generic launches in the US will be one of the major growth drivers for Lupin. The company has over 97 abbreviated new drug applications pending approval -one-third of these are the first to file applications (bearing 180day exclusive marketing rights). 

 Bulk of these approvals is likely to come around over the next two fiscals.

  Larsen and Toubro (L&T) on Thursday reported a 17.25% growth in standalone net profit to 1,686.21 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. 
  
  Company's net profit in 2010-11 declined 10% to 3,957.89 crore. Analysts were not perturbed by the decline since it was primarily because the previous year's profits were boosted by higher exceptional gain on divestment of stake in subsidiaries. Recurring net profit for the year was up 15% year-on-year. 
  
  L&T reported a total income of 43,904.91 crore for the year ended March, up 19% on year, missing the 20% guidance marginally. 
  
  Larsen & Toubro missed its sales and order inflow guidance for 2010-11 but is confident that revenue in the current fiscal will grow by a quarter, driven by a pick-up in orders and execution of projects. 
  
  
  Here are few views and recommendations on the stock: 
  
  
  L&T has taken the market by surprise: Deepak Mohoni, trendwatchindia.com
  
  L&T has, by the looks of it, taken the market by surprise because it was not very far maybe just 1% or 2% to go on the downside and it would have been at a 2 or 3-year low. The market, given the way the stock was moving, was clearly not expecting anything that positive. 
  
  When you get something really unexpected and positive, you do get strong moves and we are seeing exactly that in L&T. The upside could be perhaps a lot more than what you would hope for. 
  
  
  L&T looks positive: Prakash Diwan, Networth Stock Broking
  
  The run up yesterday has been quite significant in single session. It has moved significantly and I think you may not see the repeat every day for the next few days but yes it remains in a positive expectation zone of sorts and I would be surprised if it heads to the 1660 kind of a mark and stabilises there for a while before the next set of cues come in. 
  
  So it does looks positive. I do not see any retracement going down from where it has moved up yesterday so looks positive of course you will have to see how the capex cycles are spanning out in the next couple of quarters for the stock to really give some sort of a direction. 
  
  
  Time to be long in L&T: Sudarshan Sukhani, Technical Trends
  
  As a short term trader, it is time to be long in L&T. Yesterday’s rally if the market continues up, we should see significant follow through today also and L&T would this time at least contribute to the gains which the index could come with. 
  
  
  On declines, buy L&T: Ashwani Gujral
  
  1450-1500 was a key support and whatever the results would have been, I do not think they were too good and still you saw 5-6% type of rally. So now on declines, L&T becomes a buy. On the upside 1750 is a good target and in any kind of pullback, it will probably participate.

  What is your take on Kalindee Rail?
   
  I do not see anything happening. I do not see that volume. I do not see anything on the chart pattern. Pretty sideways, you have just one off ticks. It is very thinly traded and till it closes beyond 185-186, I do not really have a view and I will definitely not be positive. 
  
  Whatever this stock will move will be purely based on fundamental news and maybe nearer the budget these kind of stocks move up or down. So for me, I am not interested at this point of time.

In an interview to ET Now, he remains muted on IT stocks.  

 
ET Now: Tata Consultancy has said that Chennai floods will have a material impact on its revenues during this quarter. Do you think that other IT firms will also react to Chennai floods? 

 
Deven Choksey: I am not very sure. 

 The Chennai episode might have a negative impact on the companies but that will play out well. I do not think that market will give discount beyond a point on to this particular subject. 

 Firms like Infosys are adopting a change in their business model. They are venturing into more acquisition-led growth and are particularly investing money into start-ups and creating a better amount of franchisee on that side. This aspect is interesting but it would not not give result benefits, at least in the coming couple of quarters. 

 Currently, I think, one will have to see whether these companies are meeting the projections that they had spelt out. If they do, then the market will not go negative on those companies but otherwise one will have to play tactfully at this point of time in selecting the stocks in the market. 

 As of now we are not getting further exposure in the IT space. So we'd stay muted on that front for now.

Nitin Raheja: Given the fact that the market breadth has become so narrow and it is really just a few stocks which are holding up the Nifty, this is a very different market, to what we have seen in the last few days from what we were seeing earlier. So my own view really is that some part of the euphoria surrounding the election, the budget is now all behind and people are starting to look at hard numbers. As numbers are coming in, they are really seeing that lot of stocks have actually run themselves far ahead on expectations. So if you ask me in the short to medium term, my belief is it is going to become an extremely focussed market. It is going to become stock specific oriented market rather than a broad euphoria led market.

Decoding the cryogenic engine used in ISRO launch,"{""ISRO"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-isro-developed-the-indigenous-cryogenic-engine/articleshow/28575364.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,How ISRO developed the indigenous cryogenic engine,"The year was 1987. V Gnanagandhi, head of the cryogenic engine project at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), wanted to set up a high-pressure hydrogen plant in Mahendragiri near Thiruvanathapuram. But an official from the supplier of the machinery, a German company called Messers Grieshem, suddenly threw a spanner in the works. “There are snakes and elephants on the roads in India,” he told them. “How can I come there?” 

 Gnanagandhi reached a compromise with the Grieshem executive. He need come only as far as Mumbai; the entire ISRO team would meet him there. He agreed. The German—his name is now forgotten—agreed to sell the machinery, but was also inquisitive. “Why do you need a high-pressure hydrogen facility?” he asked. “We are using it to launch rockets,” came the answer. “You cannot just fill an engine tank with high-pressure hydrogen,” he told the ISRO team. “It will evaporate in no time.” The ISRO engineers, thus, learned a thing or two about dealing with hydrogen at high pressure. 
  
 A few days ago, Gnanagandhi retired after watching his baby fly on a Geostationary Launch Vehicle (GSLV), marking the culmination of a journey that was shot through with frustrations, technology denials, quiet diplomacy and sheer hard work. After two decades of development, India developed the cryogenic technology, giving it the much-needed capability to launch medium-sized satellites in a geostationary orbit, and joined an exclusive club of six nations. But on that day in 1987, at their Mumbai Guest House, ISRO engineers, led by Gnanagandhi, were taught a thing or two about hydrogen under pressure by their German guest. 

 
Obtaining The Engine 

 Brought into the nascent cryogenic engine team in 1984, Gnanagandhi had begun his job with clean slate. He had not even heard about the cryogenic engine. He didn’t know how to get liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen, let alone how to use them in an engine. But he learned quickly, set up the facilities, and made a one-tonne prototype engine by 1988. It blew up during a test. “We had used liquid nitrogen to clean the nozzle,” says Gnanagandhi. “And nitrogen solidifies and clogs the nozzle at liquid oxygen temperatures.” ISRO was led by UR Rao at that time. ISRO had been planning larger rockets. 

 Cryogenic engines were absolutely essential to put satellites in geostationary orbit, but the technology was difficult and a closely guarded secret. India had offers of engines. US firm General Dynamics offered first at a high price, and so did the French. It was then that Russia, which was going through difficult times, offered it at a reasonable price. India signed a deal in 1991 for two engines and the technology. 

 Everything looked good, but soon wasn’t. The Americans pressurised the Russians into reneging on the deal, saying its engines will be used for nuclear missiles. 

 ISRO would get the engines but not the technology. UR Rao went to talk to the Americans, and to tell them something that everybody knew: cryogenic engines cannot be used in a missile. But the US had strong commercial interests in denying India the technology. Rao’s meeting with vice-president Al Gore was futile. 

 Rao then negotiated with the Russians. “I told them that I had paid them too much money for just two engines,” says Rao. “If you are not giving me the technology, give me six more engines.” Eventually ISRO got seven engines. However, flying them was not a simple matter as there were no data about their performance. The engines that ISRO got hadn’t been flown yet in any rocket. ISRO engineers discovered they had to work hard to make the engines fly in their launch vehicle. “We found that the Russian engines did not perform as well as we expected,” says Vishnu Kartha, who now heads the cryogenic project. 

 
Developing The Technology 

 If flying the Russian engines was hard, copying the engine design was harder. The Russians had designed these engines in the 1960s but not flown them, probably because they were still not flight ready. Moreover, they used a technology— called stage combustion—that was efficient but difficult. It made the engine a bit heavy but gave the highest efficiencies for a specific amount of propellant. The indigenous engines had to be exactly like the Russian engines: the GSLV has already been planned based on them. 

 The Indian government gave a formal approval to the Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) project in 1994. The budget was Rs 300 crore. ISRO then made a key decision quite in keeping with its tradition: involve the private industry from the beginning. “We didn’t want to first develop the technology and then transfer it,” says BN Suresh, now Vikram Sarabhai distinguished professor in ISRO. 

 The two major partners were Godrej and the MTAR Technologies. Godrej set up the rotary vacuum brazing facility in Mumbai. Brazing was a key and difficult technology, and setting up the facility took more than a year. MTAR made the turbo pump and some other components. 

 The sophistication of the cryogenic engine would be obvious from a few simple facts. The liquid hydrogen is kept at -253 degree centigrade. The turbo pump operates at 500 degree centigrade and rotates 40,000 times a minute. The combustion temperature is around 3,000 degree centigrade. 

 The pressure inside the combustion chamber is 60 times the atmospheric pressure. The chamber wall has to withstand the high pressure and temperature. No material can withstand a temperature of 3,000 degree centigrade, and so the combustion chamber wall has to be cooled. 

 
Lift Off 

 ISRO’s cryogenic team made the first 7.5-tonne engine in 2000. It blew up while being tested. The hydrogen valve had prematurely closed, affecting the oxygenhydrogen ratio in the combustion chamber. “We became failure-hardened,” says Mohammed Mulsim, head of the cryogenic project at that time. “After each failure we went back not to the Russian engines but to the drawing board.” They succeeded finally in 2002. The indigenous cryogenic engine was qualified in 2003. It took another four years to integrate it with the GSLV. But the first flight failed in 2010, as the engine shut down three seconds after ignition. 

 ISRO then conducted a thorough review of the entire GSLV project. For the cryogenic engine, special vacuum testing facilities were created at Mahendragiri. By 2013 end, every likely cause of failure was looked into. A few days before the GSLV flew on January 5, ISRO officials conducted a review meeting to clear the vehicle for launch. Such meetings usually take several hours. This one ended in 45 minutes. Every possibility had been analysed, and project leaders were quietly confident. 

 When it flew, the GSLV put the satellite into orbit with a precision never possible with the Russian engines. “We took a long time to develop the engine,” says ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan, “but all countries took 10-15 years to develop cryogenic technology.” ISRO now has to develop a more powerful engine, to put a 4-tonne satellite into geosynchronous orbit. The older generation that led the first cryogenic engine development has retired. It has been such a long journey, it gave the younger generation now in command a deep understanding of cryogenic technology. And they have long stints left in ISRO.

 The dividend of Rs 64 crore is 650 per cent of its paid-up share capital of Rs 9.89 crore. The company announced the decision to pay the dividend in its 36th Annual General Meeting held yesterday. 

 According to a company statement, the cumulative dividend paid to the shareholders including the interim payment for the previous fiscal amounts to Rs 94 crore. 

 Besides dividend, the state-run company has also approved a bonus issue of 1:1, which would take the paid-up share capital to Rs 19.79 crore. 

 A P Mishra, Chairman Ircon and Member Engineering Railway Board, while addressing the shareholders highlighted the achievements of the company during 2011-12, in particular its the turnover of Rs. 3782 crores and a net profit of Rs 470 crore which is 95 per cent more than that of last year.

That is an opportunity for investors who are willing to buy and hold for a bit longer, says Sandip Sabharwal, asksandipsabharwal.com

Indian Hotels at Rs 300 plus, Titagarh Wagon at Rs 170, PVR is holding on and IT is down. What is your view?
I think many stocks are doing well. Auto stocks are doing well, some capital goods stocks are doing well, there’s reasonable performance from some auto ancillary stocks too and we bought tyre stocks some time back. I think it is a market where stock picking is working but overall it is an extended market.

Initially we are completely defying all global trends but let us see how long that lasts because it is very tough. The kind of moves Indian markets are giving are in complete contrast to emerging markets as well as world markets. The probability of that historically would not be more than 5%. Whether this 5% carries on is what we need to see.


What is the outlook on the realty sector because NCC management was talking about how there has been a slowdown in construction but things are certainly picking up. Now a lot of global uncertainties are out of the way?
The NCC management over a period of time has become very conservative so they give conservative guidance but the way they have managed their balance sheet vis-à-vis other construction companies is something that I like plus the dividend payout.

Look at the dividend yield of any infra company; it would be 1% or less than 1%. The dividend yield at Rs 2 is almost 3% of the stock price when they declared the dividend. The company is growing well and we still do not see fund managers wanting to buy infra stocks. While people have started buying capital goods stocks, infra stocks are still not much in demand. That is an opportunity for investors who are willing to buy and hold for a bit longer.


What is your take regarding the entire diagnostics basket that went for a tizzy when Adani announced that they are looking to get into the diagnostic space? Today we saw some of these names bouncing back. Is there an underlying story there?
There is no story. The competitive intensity is increasing substantially. Lupin has got into it. The Adani group has announced plans. Torrent Pharma has also announced entry into diagnostics. It seems to be a tough space. Pricing will remain under pressure and as it is, the Covid-led testing spike will get over. So, in the next year or year-and-a-half, there will be a base impact which will keep the growth slow.

A combination of slow growth combined with margin compression will be the story for diagnostics. The one-off, one week kind of moves will keep on happening but directionally I do not see a story here.

After the sugar rush of the Covid business was over, the diagnostic stocks are down 20-50% from the recent high but these are businesses which are still growing. There is 10-15% growth and consolidation is happening. Plus four-five players are still there?
The number of players on the organised side are increasing and the second thing we need to understand is that at peak, Dr Lal went to 100 price earning ratio which was unsustainable. Today given the earning cuts which have happened, it trades at around 60 times. Whoever wants to give a 10-12% growth business, 60 PE, it is good for them and if they make money out of it, better but I do not see a story at five times PEG on a longer term.

Why long-term investors should stay invested in Infosys,"{""Infosys"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-long-term-investors-should-stay-invested-in-infosys/articleshow/44768879.cms,m.economictimes.com,Why long-term investors should stay invested in Infosys,"Infosys under its new leadership seems to be marching ahead in the right direction. A while ago, the company announced its September quarter financials, which were slightly better than the consensus of analysts’ estimates. Moreover, it also issued bonus shares signalling the management’s confidence in the future growth.  However, contrary to the expectation of some analysts, the company did not revise the full year dollar revenue growth guidance of 7-9%. But, that need not disappoint long-term investors.  Here’s why it makes sense to stay invested in the stock if you believe in the long-term, value driven investing: The bonus issue: Infosys has declared one bonus share for every existing share and 1:1 stock dividend for American Depository Shares. Technically, an issue of a bonus shares does not have any material impact on the shareholder since the share price will be adjusted once the process of allotment of bonus shares begins, i.e. after the record date. But, it does offer an insight into what the management is thinking of the future growth. This is because bonus shares increase the capital base of the company since a chunk of surplus profit in the balance sheet is converted into equity. A company that pays dividends regularly and has a responsible management will do this only when it is confident that it would be able to serve this larger capital base through dividends, and buybacks of shares in the future.  Sustained business momentum in the US and Europe: Growth in these two key markets sustained during the September quarter on a sequential basis. The US grew by 3.1% and Europe by 4.2%. While the growth in the financial services vertical continued to stay tepid at 1.2%, other verticals such as manufacturing and energies, utilities, communications and services was buoyant.  Attrition: Attrition touched a high of 20.1% during the September 2014 quarter compared with 19.5% a quarter ago and 17.3% a year ago. This is expected to decrease in the coming quarters considering the efforts of CEO Vishal Sikka to retain talent. According to recent media reports, the management had undertaken revision of senior management salaries. The company also gave promotions to 12,000 employees during the September quarter apart from giving 100% of variable pay to all employees.  Operating performance: Infosys has been posting subdued growth compared with what some of its bigger and smaller peers have been reporting and also lower than the industry average. This is expected to change albeit slowly. To begin with, the company has been able to keep the fall in its operating margin under check. In the September quarter, it reported a margin of 26.1%, a 100 basis points improvement over the previous quarter. The days for which sales was outstanding were 63, an improvement over 67 days a quarter ago.  Strong cash management: Infosys has over $4.5 billion (close to Rs 28,000 crore) of cash and equivalents. Its cash generation from operations has also remained strong over the years. With focus on growth, the new management is in the process of finding the right opportunities to deploy the cash.   "

 1. In Budget 2013, the finance minister has announced a proposal to introduce inflation-indexed bonds (IIB) or inflation-indexed national security certificates.
 
 2. The fixed income instruments pay a stipulated interest through the term of the bond. The real return for the investor will be low in keeping with the inflation.
 
 3. The impact of inflation is higher for those who invest in long-term fixed income bonds. The IIBs will be of interest to the investors seeking to protect their long-term debt portfolio from the effects of inflation.
 
 4. The IIBs negate inflation as the interest received on bonds and maturity value are linked to the prevailing inflation. The principal amount is adjusted by an inflation indexation factor for each interest payment period.
 
 5. The choice of the inflation measure used as a benchmark to adjust for inflation will determine the efficacy of the bonds in protecting the investor against the effect of inflation.
 
 6. The taxability of interest income, maturity value and the relative attractiveness of the post-tax returns of the bonds compared with other fixed income options must be evaluated before making a decision.

 The move follows poor response to the bonds, which the government had hoped will click with investors as an opportunity to invest in assets that produce real returns. “We have got some feedback. We are in discussion with the government, so some clarification will come...on existing features some clarification has been sought,” said RBI deputy governor HR Khan.
 
 The central bank on Thursday also held a meeting with bank chairmen on how to popularise the saving instrument amongst investors. Distribution or sale of bonds is done through banks. “We will come with something. All of them have committed. Issues of marketing, availability of forms, awareness campaign, all these things are happening and banks chairmen have committed to take it forward,” said Khan.
 
 Subscription to these bonds was initially open only for nine days in December (December 23-December 31) but the RBI had extended the offer to March 31, 2014 due to poor response.
 
 Khan said demand for such bonds is now picking up and immediately there will be no feature changes. The minimum limit for investment through these instruments is .`5,000 and the maximum is .`5 lakh per applicant, annually. The government hopes these bonds will wean investors away from gold by offering a real 1.5% return over retail inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
 
 The government is looking to contain gold imports at 850 tonnes this fiscal against 950 tonnes in the corresponding period last year. The Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-Cumulative are available only to individuals, Hindu Undivided Family, registered charitable institutions and approved universities.

Mobius said it’s just the ""beginning of a good time ahead"" for Indian stocks, which have attracted foreign portfolio investments to the tune of $4.5 billion so far in 2014.
 
 Markets have been rising on the expectation that a stable government will be formed after the election, with opinion polls favouring the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party.
 
 “If Modi forms the next government at the Centre, he can implement reforms the way he has done for Gujarat,"" Mobius told ET. But he is critical of the BJP's manifesto pledge to block foreign direct investment in the retail sector if it forms the next government.
 
 “It’s not a good idea to block FDI. If the government allows foreigners to come into distribution and logistics, it will be a positive development,"" he said. Mobius said the government should make rules simpler not only to encourage foreign investment but also domestic investment by cutting red tape. ""There is a need to reduce the number of restrictions and requirements for licensing etc., which is essential in order to get things moving,"" he said. Mobius said there are hundreds of millions of dollars waiting to get into India.
 
 ""They are not getting in now because of restrictions regarding information on shareholders. The government has put regulation which prevents many foreigners from entering the market as they require the name and details of foreign investors,"" he said.
 
 The rupee's strength against the dollar is not good news for technology companies, said Mobius. If the rupee strengthens further, export-oriented companies will be at a disadvantage. The rupee has gained nearly 11% since the August low of 68.82 against the dollar.
 
 Mobius, whose funds are invested in Sun Pharma, said the Ranbaxy acquisition is good for the company as Indian pharmaceutical firms are making major breakthroughs.
 
 As for other sectors, if the Indian economy improves, the banking sector will look very good, he said.

 Last month, the company had entered into an amended share purchase agreement with five buyers including DCB Power Ventures and Kiran Vyapar to sell its 19.06 per cent stake in IEX for Rs 409.95 crore. 

 Of the total, FTIL had last week completed the sale of 13.6 per cent stake in IEX. 

 In a regulatory filing, Financial Technologies said that the company has concluded the sale of the rest 5.46 per cent equity stake in IEX on fully diluted basis with Agri Power and Engineering Solutions. 

 ""With the conclusion of above transaction, the company has completed the sale of 19.06 per cent stake in IEX on fully diluted basis,"" it said. 

 Accordingly, 16,55,557 equity shares has been transferred to Agri Power and Engineering Solutions, it said. 

 Jignesh Shah-led FTIL has exited from commodity exchange business in India and abroad after the then commodity markets regulator FMC declared the company and the promoter unfit to run the business. 

 Following the FMC order, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had said FTIL is not fit and proper to own stakes in any stock exchange and directed it to divest existing holdings in MCX-SX and four other entities. 

 Power sector regulator CERC had also issued an order saying decisions of Sebi and FMC have a direct bearing on the power market.

How India Inc can woo more international investors,"{""India Inc"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/how-india-inc-can-woo-more-international-investors/articleshow/30583484.cms,m.economictimes.com,How India Inc can woo more international investors," 	The FM has outlined a few measures to deepen the financial markets. Nonlegistative in nature and approved in principle by all financial regulators, some of these steps can be implemented over the next few weeks. ET takes you through the proposals:  	Revamp ADR/GDR scheme, enlarge the scope of depository receipts (DRs)  	Indian companies, including unlisted ones, will find it easier to raise money. They will be permitted to issue DRs to international investors against any underlying security -- like debenture, mutual fund, government bond as well as equity. At present, depository receipts can be issued with only equity as underlying security. The proposed changes are based on recommendations made by the MS Sahoo panel which said DRs can also be issued in any jurisdiction that is IOSCO and FATF compliant without any end-use restriction on funds.  	Liberalise the rupee-denominated corporate bond market  	This is aimed at attracting more foreign inflows in rupee-denominated bonds. As a short-term measure, the government, last June, had cut withholding tax for two years, from 20% to 5% to enable greater inflows in debt market. Chances are that the market can be freed up to introduce more products. At present, foreign investors can invest only in listed non-convertible debentures issued by Indian firms. The liberalisation move could also create a legal framework for rupee-denominated offshore bonds that can be listed abroad.  	Strengthen currency derivatives market  	 					 	Many companies, particularly smaller ones, are unable to hedge their foreign exchange risks effectively in the overthe-counter market, thanks to costs. For such corporates, listed currency derivatives can offer a cheaper route to guard against a rising or falling dollar. Here, the margins are lower and transactions more transparent. This market can deepen with higher position limits and opening the doors to large funds. Such trades, however, need a daily monitoring of mark-to-market losses, if any.  	Smoother clearing and settlement for international investors in bonds  	In order to liven up a lacklustre corporate bond market, the government intends to provide a seamless and risk-free settlement of trades. This could call for local depositories tying up with their foreign counterparts. Since the average deal size in bonds is larger compared to equities, the counter-party risk is also higher with most trades happening outside the exchange. Financial market participants, however, are not enthused by the suggestions as bond market reforms have been hanging fire for more than a decade. "
IIFL Commodities behind NSEL defamation notice?,"{""IIFL Commodities"": ""neutral"", ""NSEL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/iifl-commodities-behind-nsel-defamation-notice/articleshow/46939304.cms,m.economictimes.com,IIFL Commodities behind NSEL defamation notice?,"Buzz doing the rounds in market circles has it that IIFL Commodities is the broker behind the Rs 500-crore defamation notice against scam-hit NSEL and its joint MD Prakash Chaturvedi. The broker is reportedly miffed with the bourse for having written to regulators like RBI and Sebi to declare the company “not fit and proper” to run its business after a director’s arrest in connection with the NSEL scam. 

 The company feels the defunct bourse, itself an accused in the scam, has no locus standi to ask regulators, which don’t oversee IIFL, to declare it unfit. The notice to Chaturvedi is because of a phone conversation with an NSEL investor in which he purportedly said that IIFL Commodities has a liability of `1,600 crore towards NSEL investors.

2G auction will not impact Idea Cellular,"{""Idea Cellular"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/2g-auction-will-not-impact-idea-cellular/articleshow/15973405.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,2G auction will not impact Idea Cellular," The balance sheet health of Idea Cellular will not be affected much in the near term post the 2G spectrum auction even if the bidding gets as aggressive as anticipated by the telecom minister. The provision of upfront payment of only 33% of the total spectrum bid value and the rest in a phased manner for 10 years will keep the financials of the telcom player largely unscathed at the operating level provided it maintains the current growth of operating profit before depreciation, shows an ET Intelligence Group analysis.
 
 Idea Cellular needs to bid for 2G spectrum in the 1,800 megahertz (MHz) band in at least seven circles following cancellation of licences in these circles by the Supreme Court in early February. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued a memorandum on Monday detailing the base price for the auction in each of the 22 telecom circles in the country.
 
 ""Funding will not be a problem for telcos such as Idea with cash generating business model. We feel, Idea will not incur any issues to bid at the auction reserve price,"" said a telecom analyst at a local brokerage on condition of anonymity. Idea will have to bid for at least 5 MHz of spectrum in each of the seven circles if it needs to retain a presence there.
 
 These include Tamil Nadu (auction reserve price of Rs 306.09 crore for 1.25 MHz spectrum), Kolkata ( Rs 113.7 crore), West Bengal ( Rs 25.84 crore), Orissa ( Rs 20.27 crore), Assam ( Rs 8.67 crore), North East ( Rs 8.84 crore), and Jammu & Kashmir ( Rs 6.63 crore). They account for nearly 7% of Idea's total subscriber base of over Rs 11.7 crore.
 
 
  
 
 The calculations show that at the base level, Idea will spend Rs 1,960 crore to regain these licences. But it will only pay one-third or Rs 653 crore upfront and enjoy a moratorium of two years wherein it need not pay interest and the principal amount of debt.
 
 The company reported a cash balance of Rs 126.5 crore at the end of June 2012, which means it will have to largely depend upon borrowings to fund the auction outgo. Assuming it funds the whole down payment through debt, the loan funds on its book will increase to Rs 12,265 crore from Rs 11,612 crore as of June 2012. Its debt-equity ratio will inch up by a modest 5 basis points to 0.92. Net debt (debt less cash on books) relative to earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBITDA) will also increase by a tad 14 basis points to 2.42 times.
 
 Further, the impact will remain muted even in case of aggressive bidding. Telecom minister Kapil Sibal told ET on Friday that he expects pan-India license bid to go as high as Rs 20,000 crore, over 42% more than the reserve price of Rs 14,000 crore. Assuming a proportionate increase in the bidding in each of the seven circles where Idea will bid, the company's debt will increase to Rs 12,526.2 crore. Its debt-equity ratio will increase to 0.94 from the current 0.87 and net debt as a percentage of EBITDA will inch up to 2.62.
 
 Industry trackers, however, expect a muted response for the auction given the existing debt burden of the telecom sector. ""The bidding may not be aggressive as it was during the 3G auction two years ago since teclos will have to borrow more funds,"" says Romal Shetty, telecom practice head, KPMG. He expects a selective bidding with most palyers bidding for limited number of circles. Norway's Telenor, which lost nine licences, will have to shell out over Rs 7,000 crore at the reserve price.
 
 Established players such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone are less likely to participate in the auction but they will have to accept the spectrum price that will be decided through the bidding process at the time of renewing their licences. Bharti, for instance, will renew its licenses in Delhi and Kolkata in 2014, which will cost over Rs 4,000 crore at the reserve price.
 
 Telecom players are expected to gain traction in data driven services with advent of new technologies that tend to merge personal computation with mobility. This should cushion the spectrum outgo in the long run.

  NEW DELHI: Clearing the decks, ICICI Bank's general body has approved acquisition of Bank of Rajasthan, which is awaiting a legal clearance although its shareholders conveyed their consent to the stock exchanges.
  
  In an unusual development, the BoR shareholders had voted yesterday after the bank management summarily called off the meeting citing a stay by a Kolkata civil court, which ICICI Bank got vacated.
  
  While the shareholders of BoR communicated their decision to the stock exchanges, saying the ""scheme of amalgamation has been duly passed by the required majority"", BoR officials maintained throughout the day that they would approach stock exchanges only after getting the decision legally validated.
  
  BoR's Managing Director and CEO G Padmanabhan said the bank has sought legal opinion on the matter, adding that the bank is in touch with the Reserve Bank about the developments.
  
  ICICI Bank said in a separate statement that its shareholders have approved the merger at the company's Extraordinary General Meeting in Vadodara yesterday.
  
  Shares of BoR settled nearly one per cent up at Rs 176.15 a piece, while that of ICICI shed 0.87 per cent to close at Rs 893.15 a share.
  
  The integration would help ICICI Bank increase its branch network by 25 per cent to about 2,500 across the country. It will give great visibility to ICICI Bank in western and northern parts of the country.
  
  Currently, ICICI Bank has about 2,000 branches while BoR has 463 spread across the country.
  
  Post merger, the balancesheet of ICICI Bank would cross Rs four lakh crore. BoR has a total business of over Rs 23,000-crore, as against nearly Rs 3,84,000-crore of ICICI Bank. BoR's turnover was Rs 1,507-crore in 2008-09, while that of ICICI Bank in 2009-10 was over Rs 33,000-crore.
  
  ICICI Bank last month agreed to take over Bank of Rajasthan in a share-swap deal that valued the Udaipur-based bank at over Rs 3,000-crore.
  
  The share swap ratio was fixed at one ICICI Bank share for every 4.72 shares of BoR.

 Meanwhile, commodity market regulator FMC has allowed NSEL to pay directly to members of IBMA.
 
 In a letter to NSEL, FMC had directed that the payouts to the members registered under IBMA can be made directly from the NSEL escrow account.
 
 NSEL suspended trading following a Consumer Affairs Ministry directive asking the bourse not to launch any new contracts till further order as it found violations of government norms in trading at the bourse.
 
 The bourse had said it prepared a payment calendar and plans to settle all the dues in 30 weeks time, by paying Rs 174.72 crore each for first 20 weeks followed by Rs 86.02 crore each in next 10 weeks.
 
 So far the bourse has defaulted 21 times in paying its dues as per payment calendar.

 “Samardeep has decided to leave the company to pursue an external opportunity,” the spokesperson said in response to ET’s emailed query.
 
 Subandh, a fast-tracker at HUL with 15 years at the firm, has been roped in by Marico to head its go-to-market (GTM) function as chief sales officer. He will report to Managing Director and Chief Executive Saugata Gupta.
 
 “We are getting top talent to take the sales function to the next level, significantly expand distribution, and infuse fresh ideas to the function,” Gupta said. Subandh’s mandate is also to set up GTM centres of excellence to support the company’s international units.
 
 An IIM-Calcutta alumni, Subandh has moved through the ranks at HUL, from sales, marketing customer development and brand building roles. Since early last year, he has been VP, modern trade and institutional business. The moves come at a time when growth of modern trade, or sales through organised retail, for consumer products slowed down to its lowest ever, in line with slowing consumers sales.
 
 According to data by researcher Nielsen, modern trade grew just 8% in 2013, down from 32% the previous year.

Hindujas to raise $1 bn through Petromin IPO,"{""Hindujas"": ""neutral"", ""Petromin"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/hindujas-to-raise-1-bn-through-petromin-ipo/articleshow/6005327.cms,m.economictimes.com,Hindujas to raise $1 bn through Petromin IPO,"
  MUMBAI: The Hinduja group, controlled by billionaire Hinduja brothers, plans to raise nearly $1 billion (approximately Rs 4,715 crore) through an initial share sale of its lubricant arm Petromin in Saudi Arabia this year, says a top official. 
  
  The group has appointed HSBC affiliate Saudi British Bank to manage the initial public offering of Petromin, its equal venture with Saudi Arabia-based Dabbagh Group, Gulf Oil International chairman Sanjay Hinduja told a press conference in Mumbai. Gulf Oil International is Hinduja group’s holding company in lubricant business. It holds nealy 50% stake in India-listed Gulf Oil Corpoaration. “Soon, we will finalise the timeline and the exact size of the initial share sale,” he said. Petromin, which has an annual sales of $500 million and controls one-third share of the downstream oil products market in Saudi Arabia, will sell a 30% stake through the IPO, he added.
  
  Gulf Oil International and the Dabbagh Group bought Petromin a few years ago from Saudi Aramco and Mobil Investments, an affiliate of ExxonMobil. Saudi Arabia is a cash-rich market. Unlike the European markets, there is a strong demand for oil and oil products in Saudi Arabia, he said adding, Petromin is looking for acquisitions in the Gulf region to boost its business.
  
  Mr Hinduja said the group is also planning an IPO in Hong Kong for Gulf Oil Marine, another unit of Gulf Oil International that sells marine lubricants. The group had started the company 18 months ago. In India, Gulf Oil Corporation is planning to tie up with a British firm to enter the defence business, he said without providing details. 
  
  The group plans to set up 10,000 mw of power in India over five years, said co-chairman Gopichand Hinduja. This includes a 1,040 mw power plant that the group took 13 years to complete at Vizag. “To make infrastructure more appealing to foreign and domestic investors, there should be accountability at every level of the project, and a responsibility to stick to timelines,” he said. The group is looking for plant sites in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, he said. “ We will announce two power plants very soon,” he added.

  Prasun Gajri, CIO, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company
  
  
  
  What is the sense a little bit of tizzy over last few sessions, never mind the fact that earnings have not been too disappointing?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: Yes, it has been a function of liquidity for a while and we are probably in a phase where mode of primary issuance is there. So the liquidity has to taper off both the primary and the secondary markets. Yes I agree the results have by and large been pretty much on track barring a few exceptions here and there. So I would not be too disappointed by the results but given the valuations, given that these have been led up by a reasonable amount of liquidity inflows, if those are not sustained, then we are going to probably see these kind of range bound markets for a while and that is a good thing for the market because it allows people to consolidate and then move on.
   
  
  Going forward from here, how much of a decline can sell off by FIIs in a significant way cause and where will you start drawing the line of danger?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: The FII sell off would be dangerous for the market very clearly because if you look at it, the domestics have been pretty much net sellers for quite a while now and FIIs have been buyers by a margin and they have been buying fairly large amounts for few months now especially beginning September. Now if that dries up, all that stability towards the primary markets, that would be your cause for concern. 
  
  Obviously the markets correct, you would expect to see the domestics getting back into the market but my experience is that when markets start falling, then people tend to wait for it to fall a little bit more before they really enter in. So it becomes a little bit of a vicious cycle. So very difficult to put a number to it but yes, if selling like yesterday from FIIs contuse for a while, that could be in a little bit correction in the market. What that number is whether it is 5% or 10% more, it is tough to call.
   
  
  What have you liked the most post the numbers? Are there any pockets that you would probably enter into with a 6-month, 1-year, 2-year horizon?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: If you look at just the results in terms of what really were a positive surprise, IT numbers were definitely a positive surprise. Some of the banking numbers have been a positive surprise as well. So these sectors have done well. Some of the pharma numbers which have come out have been fairly robust as well. So these are sectors which seem to be doing well. Capital goods numbers, especially the equipment guys, some of the smaller equipment guys as well as some of the larger cap good players have also done well. 
  
  So these are some of the elements which seem to be playing out giving some sense that we are getting the corporate capex back on track and that could develop into a bigger theme as we go forward few quarters. What has disappointed probably in terms of numbers is maybe the cement sector. The numbers have not been very great. So by and large these are our understanding of the results but still large number of results are still to come and we will see how it develops.
   
  
  Going forward from here, do you think that steel as a space is something that you would probably stay out of?
   
  
  Prasun Gajri: We have been staying out of commodities especially metals for a while and we will continue to do that. The reason we have not really been too much interested in this space is that it is very much linked to the global economic scenario and that by no means is showing any greater sense of improvement. So we want to avoid the sector as far as possible.

Mr Nayar had no comment on Mr Chandrasekaran’s appointment as second-in-command, citing the ‘silent period’ requirements prior to the announcement of his company’s results on Monday. Mr Chandra, as he is often addressed, is in his mid-40s and worked with global retailer Target Corp before moving to HCL. At Target’s India operations, he was vice-president for technology and part of the executive leadership team, reporting to the global CIO.Mr Chandra is the latest in a succession of global hands joining Indian technology companies, which are looking to strengthen their services delivery capability in a tough business environment. In recent months, Wipro Technologies hired Martha Bejar from Microsoft to head global sales and HCL roped in ex-Siemens and KPMG executive Rothin Bhattacharya as CEO of its offshoot, HCL Security. Rivals such as TCS and Patni too have been adding key talent from overseas in recent months, according to headhunters.Despite robust results, Indian technology firms see business growth in a recovered economy slouching. An analysis of S&P 500 companies shows that by June 2010, only 24% companies are expected to register a year-on-year growth of over 10%. “As tech companies look to expand their services offering, they have to search outside for relevant expertise,” said Gita Dang, founder director, Talent Advisory Services, an executive search firm.Adds K Sudarshan, managing partner, EMA Partners International: “The top management DNA of Indian IT, which has largely been grown in-house, is changing as companies look beyond the commodity business and seek to move up the value chain.’’ Executives with overseas expertise can help tech companies scour for opportunities across the globe. The Kraft-Cadbury deal, where Kraft faces SAP integration challenges with Cadbury, is a case in point. IT companies have to demonstrate not only technology implementation skills but also understand the confectionery business to clinch a deal. “To get such businesses, companies need deep domain experts and hence they have started looking outside,’’ said Mr Sudarshan. At present, IBM and EDS handle Kraft’s systems.In a recent interaction, Saurabh Govil, senior vice-president, talent engagement & development, Wipro Technologies had said, ``We have appointed senior executives from the industry to strengthen domain expertise in the last one year.’’Mr Chandra’s recruitment is HCL Technologies’ first major top-deck addition in over two years. He is said to have a sound knowledge of high-tech, retail, consumer and utility industries as well as expertise in managing global outsourcing engagements. He is a post-graduate from BITS Pilani and has an MBA from University of Pittsburgh."

"India valuations are less compelling, says Goldman Sachs","{""Goldman Sachs"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/paytm-current-share-price-compelling-entry-point-for-goldman-sachs/articleshow/94392648.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Paytm current share price compelling entry point for Goldman Sachs,"Even as investors are dumping Paytm stock, global brokerage Goldman Sachs believes that the depression in share prices is offering a compelling entry point into India’s largest and amongst the fastest-growing fintech platforms.

After the 47% year-to-date dip seen in Paytm shares on concerns around the path to profitability, Goldman sees the stock rallying around 58% to hit Rs 1,100 in the next 12 months.

The target price is still below Paytm's issue price of Rs 2,150. As compared to the current price, Paytm shares are still down over 67% for those who invested in the IPO.

”We see the business model as continuing to show strong traction, and within our internet coverage, view Paytm as one of the most compelling growth stories at an attractive price,” Goldman said in a report.

“While we recognise that lock-in expiry (86% of Paytm’s outstanding shares) in Nov ‘22 may represent an overhang on the stock, we expect Paytm to deliver c.50% revenue growth for the next few quarters and continue its transition from an erstwhile payments-only business to one with a strong financial services portfolio,” it said.

With valuation at 3.6x FY24 EV/Sales, a 30% discount to India internet peer group, the brokerage has reiterated its Buy rating on Paytm and added the stock to conviction list.

Goldman’s analysis suggests the current share price is implying scenarios such as zero revenues from Paytm’s BNPL product and halving of take rates for other lending products, or adjusted EBITDA profitability not until FY27, or 0% revenue growth starting FY33, among other outcomes, which is seen as “unlikely and overdone”. The brokerage firm’s risk-reward analysis indicates 112% upside in a bull case vs 12% downside in a bear case.

Paytm is currently trading at 3.6x FY24 revenues, similar vs global peers, but with a CY21-24E sales CAGR of 38%, vs 29% for the peer group.

“On EV/gross profit, however, Paytm at 5.6x FY24 GP, trades at an 11% discount to peers, for a gross profit growth that is 1.3x vs peers. Even within India internet, Paytm’s growth outlook is similar vs peer group, but valuation is at the lower end,” Goldman said.

Following the report, Paytm shares were trading 2 per cent higher at Rs 699.9 on BSE in a weak market. Trendlyne data shows that out of the 11 analysts with a coverage on the stock, 6 have buy ratings and 3 have sell ratings with the remaining 2 calling it a hold.

Should you bet on gold loan companies?,"{""gold loan companies"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/should-you-bet-on-gold-loan-companies/articleshow/19290169.cms,m.economictimes.com,Should you bet on gold loan companies?,"A 5 per cent drop in gold prices should not be cause for alarm since it can be seen as a temporary correction, right? Yet, gold loan companies are scurrying for cover, with Manappuram Finance, a prominent lender against the security of gold, witnessing the fallout of this price drop last week. Its shares lost 30 per cent of value in just two trading sessions, a reaction to the company’s declaration that it was expecting revenue losses in the current quarter due to the dip. 


The shares of Muthoot Finance also took a slight hit. Though all gold loan companies claim to have a sufficient cushion against the decline in gold prices, are their business models sturdy enough to withstand a sustained fall? More importantly, should you be putting your money in the stocks and bonds of these lenders?

A rigid model 

The business proposition of gold loan companies is simple: they disburse loans to people who are willing to offer their gold possessions as collateral. The sanctioned loan is lesser than the worth of the pledged jewellery, which acts as a safety margin for the lender. Should the borrower default on the loan, the company can sell the pledged gold in the market through an auction. Since the value of the actual loan is less than the value of gold, a slight drop in gold price does not come in the way of the company recovering its money.

However, the model’s simplicity makes it susceptible since the profitability of the company hinges entirely on a low default rate and stability in gold prices. The lender bets on the fact that the borrower is not likely to default as he is typically attached to the jewellery and would want it back. However, this argument does not hold much water. If, for some reason, gold prices tank by, say, more than 20 per cent, it would actually be an incentive for the borrower to default.

Suppose a company gives Rs 80 as loan against gold jewellery worth Rs 100. Assuming a 25 per cent rate of interest, the borrower would owe the company Rs 100. Now, if gold prices fall by 15 per cent, the value of the gold pledged as collateral comes down to Rs 85. A person who is struggling to make ends meet will no longer have an incentive to pay back the money. This is another problem with gold loan companies: most of their clients are not credit worthy, pledging their jewellery since they they are badly strapped for cash and have no other alternative.


	 
For the company, too, the credit profile of the borrower takes a backseat since growth comes from lending more and more. If, however, gold prices fall, it is a potential minefield for the company. In the case of Manappuram, the problem is acute because the loan-tovalue (LTV) ratio is very high.

Since March 2012, the revised Reserve Bank of India guidelines require the loans to be capped at 60 per cent of the value of pledged gold. Prior to this, most companies were lending at much higher LTVs (up to 85 per cent in some cases) as soaring gold prices did not warrant caution.

About 15 per cent of the loans disbursed by Manappuram in the third quarter of the fiscal year are now under stress as these were lent at high LTVs, with the average LTV for its outstanding loans being 70 per cent. Even at a higher LTV, the risk to the lender’s principal remains low unless gold prices fall much more sharply.


				

However, it also means that if the borrower defaults, the lender has to forgo the anticipated interest income on the loan. Since lenders account for these receivables in their books, a default or under-recovery means a large-scale reversal in interest income. Besides, the bullet nature of repayment, where borrowers repay the entire sum at one go at the end of the tenure, means that one cannot predict a default till such a time.

Another problem faced by gold loan companies is the availability of low-cost funds. These firms had been on a growth spree as they had access to cheap funds from banks, which were allowed to fund NBFCs for lending against gold as part of priority sector lending activity. However, now that the RBI has excluded this category from priority sector lending, their source of low-cost funding has dried up.


	 
These companies are now forced to borrow at a much higher cost in the form of non-convertible debentures and bank credit lines, which has led to reduction in margins.
Should you invest? 

It is evident that gold loan companies don’t take kindly to a price fall. Even if defaults don’t rise sharply with every dip in gold price, the business is affected as the loan size also reduces in tandem with the value of gold. The revised RBI lending norms have also taken the sheen off the gold loan companies, with the customer base shrinking slightly.

The slashing of the LTV and the higher auction of gold jewellery have led to the decline in customer base. Says Ambareesh Baliga, a market expert: “The growth expectations for these companies will have to be tempered in line with the lower disbursements after the revised guidelines. Several brokerages have pruned the earnings estimates for gold loan companies for the fiscal year 2013.”
The credit profiles of these companies could also face a threat in case of a sustained fall in gold prices. With reference to Manappuram, Icra observes, “If the lenders were to become cautious and restrict access to these limits or hold back on fresh limits, the credit profile of the company could be adversely affected.”

However, some believe that the problems are not likely to persist since stringent lending norms have come into effect. A research note on Manappuram by Ambit Capital states, “Such instances of income reversal should not recur due to lower LTVs and interest rates on the loans issued after February 2012”, provided gold prices do not fall by more than 10 per cent within a year.

Unless you believe in the misplaced notion that gold prices are only meant to go up, it would be wise to limit the exposure to such firms.

General Insurance Corporation to offer catastrophe bonds,"{""General Insurance Corporation"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/general-insurance-corporation-to-offer-catastrophe-bonds/articleshow/34506135.cms,m.economictimes.com,General Insurance Corporation to offer catastrophe bonds,"MUMBAI: Indian bond investors will soon get a novel product — catastrophe bonds — from the state-run reinsurer, but it will be a highrisk and high-reward game which those with deep pockets alone may be able to take. The bonds will fund claims after a catastrophe like earthquake, or flood. These bonds help reinsurers transfer the financial risk of a catastrophe in a year to investors.
 
 GIC Re, the sole Indian reinsurer, has sought government’s permission for one such bond, said a person aware of the development. “We have written to the ministry on issuing ‘cat’ bonds in India,” said an executive of General Insurance Corporation. “We will approach the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority,” he said. GIC Re is attempting to establish itself as a bigger player in the international reinsurance business.
 
 It has been underwriting many global events in the past. For the company, it is a natural progression to launch what is popularly known as ‘cat bonds’. The ‘cat bond’ market size is more than $20 billion. The bonds, popular in the US, are generally priced 200 basis points above the 10-year US treasury yield.
 
 The price offered on ‘cat bonds’ is higher than corporate bonds as they carry junk status and investors run the risk of losing their entire sum. GIC will raise funds for a particular catastrophic risk like either earthquake or a tsunami or a cyclone with the condition that if the event happens, there will be no payout of interest or principal.
 
 But if the event does not happen, investors will get a higher yield than in other top-rated bonds. GIC saw a claim of Rs2,000 crore in Uttarakhand floods. It has not announced last fiscal’s result. In 2012-13, it had posted a profit ofRs2,345 crore against a loss of Rs2,469 crore in the previous year.
 
 GIC will be the first company to issue ‘cat bonds’ in India and is likely to benchmark them against the 10-year government securities. According to the Swiss Re Cat Bond Price Return Index, ‘cat bonds’ have returned 9.09 per cent in the nine months till September last. Large global reinsurance companies like AXA, Swiss Re sell ‘cat bonds’ to reinsure against catastrophes.

"MCX-SX distances itself from FTIL, plans makeover","{""FTIL"": ""neutral"", ""MCX-SX"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/mcx-sx-distances-itself-from-ftil-plans-makeover/articleshow/30757216.cms,m.economictimes.com,"MCX-SX distances itself from FTIL, plans makeover","MUMBAI: The MCX Stock Exchange (MCX-SX), which is trying to distance itself from promoter FTIL and the ‘MCX’ brand, is planning to re-build its image. As a first step, it has reclassified FTIL (Financial Technologies) and Multi-Commodity Stock Exchange as public shareholders. 

 At a meeting on February 13, the new board, constituted in the wake of the Rs 5,500-crore fraud at the FTIL subsidiary National Spot Exchange (NSEL), took the decision to reclassify the promoter shareholders. Shareholder director U Venkataraman has also stepped down from the board of MCX-SX. 

 When contacted, Saurabh Sarkar, MD & CEO, MCX Stock Exchange, said, “The Board has noted that Financial Technologies and MCX are not considered promoters and accordingly their shareholdings have been classified as public shareholding.” 

 He also said that U Venkatraman has resigned from the board of the exchange with effect from February 14, 2014, but will continue to act as MD & CEO of MCX-SX Clearing Corporation, asubsidiary of the exchange. 

 Also, the bourse, according to sources, has sought suggestions from its shareholders and well wishers on how to improve its brand image which has been impacted by controversies following the NSEL default. The exchange is considering a plan to rename the bourse. 

 While no decision has been taken to change the name, the proposal will be considered if shareholders and members feel the necessity. MCX-SX shareholders include IFCI (13.2%), Union Bank of India (11.47%) and IL&FS Financial Services (9.18%). Last October, Jignesh Shah and Joseph Massey stepped down as vice-chairman and MD of MCX-SX following direction from the regulator. 

 The MCX-SX board was reconstituted with the appointment of GK Pillai, former home secretary, as chairman; public interest director Thomas Mathew, former LIC chairman, as vice chairman; and Saurabh Sarkar, former MD & CEO of United Stock Exchange, was appointed as MD & CEO. While Prof Ashima Goyal and DR Dogra are on the board as public interest directors, U Venkataraman was the shareholder director. 

 The board is currently reviewing existing contracts and agreements at the exchange. In July 2012, market regulator Sebi, while allowing the exchange to offer trading platform for new asset classes like equity, had asked MCX and FTIL, which together hold 10% in MCXSX, to reduce their holding to 5% by January 18, 2014. MCX-SX’s recognition as a stock exchange for another year (beginning Sept 16) was renewed subject to the condition that no other regulator passed an adverse order against it. 

 Sebi had asked MCX-SX to constitute a committee of two independent directors and three institutional investor nominees to oversee key business decisions, policy matters and appointments of top management personnel. In December, Sebi sent a notice to FTIL, on why recognition of its suitability to run an exchange should not be withdrawn, following a similar notice from FMC.

Financial Technologies (FTIL) recently announced that it had sold the warrants that it held in the MCX SX to a group of investors led by investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwalla. However, in August, MCX SX had cancelled FTIL’s 56.25 crore warrants and transferred the non-refundable deposits against it to reserves. This boosted the exchanges’ net worth to Rs 160 crore and saved it from hassle as regulatory requirement says it has to maintain Rs 100 crore net worth at all the time. 

 A source close to Jhunjhunwalla group said it was a calculated risk they had taken. The belief is that new investors fit the bill on ‘fit and proper’ and all other criteria and the court will allow them to convert their warrants into equity. FTIL has requested MCX-SX to register the transfer of its warrants.

FMC revises norms for surrendering membership of commexes,"{""FMC"": ""neutral"", ""commexes"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/fmc-revises-norms-for-surrendering-membership-of-commexes/articleshow/45717022.cms,m.economictimes.com,FMC revises norms for surrendering membership of commexes,"NEW DELHI: Commodity markets regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has revised norms for surrendering membership of bourses with effect from today. 

 ""The Commission has received representations that the existing procedure for surrender of membership is cumbersome and time consuming. ...After detailed consultations with all the stakeholders and exchanges, the revised procedure for surrender of membership has been approved,"" FMC said in its latest circular. 

 As per the revised norms, once commodity bourses receive an application for surrender of membership from a member, they should advertise the same for public information and clients' complaints, if any, within one month from the date of receipt of such application. 

 Advertisements should be published in at least one national-level newspaper and one local newspaper which is widely circulated in the locality in which the member concerned is located. 

 Further, the exchange should ensure as far as possible that the application of surrender of membership is informed to the clients of the concerned member by way of text message or emails. 

 The exchange should provide 60 days for receiving complaints against the member after the date of publication of the advertisement. And the exchange should redress complaints, if any against the member within 60 days of receipt of such complaints. 

 After processing redressal of all the complaints against the member, if the exchange considers the case eligible for surrender, the exchange should intimate the regulator of the same within 15 days. 

 If no communication is received by the exchange from the regulator within 30 days of such intimation, the exchange can approve the request of surrender of membership and should refund all the deposits of the member within three months of the date of intimation to the regulator. 

 List of the members whose request of surrender has been approved by the exchange, along with date of approval, should be widely published by posting the same on the website of the exchange. 

 FMC said that revised norms will be applicable from January 1 and exchanges are directed to make suitable changes in their bye-laws, rules and regulation.

FMC unveils uniform warehouse accreditation norms for bourses,"{""FMC"": ""neutral"", ""bourses"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/fmc-unveils-uniform-warehouse-accreditation-norms-for-bourses/articleshow/45247699.cms,m.economictimes.com,FMC unveils uniform warehouse accreditation norms for bourses,"NEW DELHI: The Forward Markets Commission (FMC) has come out with uniform norms for giving accreditation to warehouse services providers by commodity exchanges, a step to inspire confidence among market participants. 

 This will also strengthen warehouse facilities in the commodity futures market. It assumes significance in the backdrop of Rs 5,600-crore payment scam at NSEL which exposed the poor warehousing monitoring. 

 FMC has directed the national level bourses to follow the new norms by March 31, 2015. It has also asked the bourses not to allow existing warehouse services providers to operate beyond June 30, 2015, according to a circular issued by the commodity markets regulator. 

 Commodity exchanges at present follow different norms and standards while giving accreditation to warehouses on their platform. 

 ""This is for the first time that the FMC has framed uniform norms for accreditation of WSPs (warehouse services providers) to ensure credibility of warehouses and the warehousing receipts issued by them. It is necessary that the WSPs accredited by exchanges inspire confidence among the market participants,"" a senior FMC official told PTI. 

 As per new norms, the exchanges can give recognise warehouses having a minimum networth of Rs 25 crore. However, for warehouses providing services for single commodity at a particular location, the minimum networth requirement may be relaxed to Rs 10 crore. 

 Warehouses should be in the public same business for last at least three years. Their promoters should have a good business reputation and credibility, says the circular. 

 That apart, warehouses are also required to furnish a security deposit in the range of 3-5 per cent of the value of the goods worth up to Rs 500 crore in the warehouse. 

 To ensure good corporate governance, FMC said: ""Management of WSP or entities owned or controlled by management of WSP/Group concerns or persons 'acting in concert' shall not be allowed to trade on the commodity exchange in the commodity for which it is accredited by exchange."" 

 FMC further said that warehouses should have a professional management team to oversee its functioning and operations. They should submit a networth certification and financial statements to exchange every six months. 

 Warehouses should also have a 'Customer Grievance Cell' and comply with 'Know Your Depositor Policy' from time to time. 

 While giving accreditation to warehouses, exchanges should see if warehouses have infrastructure facilities for proper handling and storage of commodities. 

 Warehouses are required to insurance cover of the stock stored in the warehouses, periodic audit of the stock, electronic record of the information of the warehouses among other. 

 The exchanges are also directed to make suitable amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations as required for the implementation of these norms, the FMC said. 

 There are four national and six regional level exchanges operating in the country.

FMC mulls centre-specific commodity forward trades,"{""FMC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/fmc-mulls-centre-specific-commodity-forward-trades/articleshow/33836665.cms,m.economictimes.com,FMC mulls centre-specific commodity forward trades,"MUMBAI: The Forward Markets Commission (FMC) is considering permitting bourses to offer centre-specific, short-term forward trades in highly traded farm products as the regulator aims to increase delivery in the Rs 101- lakh crore commodity futures market, which is dominated by speculation and hedging.
 
 Termed a ""game changer"" by Ramesh Abhishek, chairman, FMC, these contracts will allow traders to buy commodities like chana, rapeseed mustard, castorseed, etc, on commodity exchanges, where currently they can’t do so. This, Abhishek feels, could increase delivery by physical market traders on the six national bourses, which posted volumes ofRs 101-lakh crore in the fiscal year through March.
 
 Market estimation of delivery on the bourses is just 2-3% of annual volumes, with a larger portion being because of speculation and hedging.
 
 ""The contracts will be centre-based,"" said Abhishek. ""Modalities of the contracts are being worked out by the exchanges. We are encouraging them to launch products that result in greater proportion of delivery.""
 
 Currently, on the futures market, say a chana trader who wants delivery of the pulse at Bikaner, places an order to buy. However, at the contract expiry, which usually happens on the 20th of a month, he realises the chana delivered is from another centre, say, Delhi. The quality and price of this chana differs from that in Bikaner. This may dissuade a trader from buying or selling on the futures market.
 
 FMC and the exchanges feel centre-specific forward contracts could address the demand from such market constituents.
 
 Atul Chaturvedi, CEO, Adani Wilmar, which handles 2.5-million tonnes of edible oils across the country and is known for the Fortune brand of cooking oil, agreed that such contracts could ""facilitate"" and ""improve"" deliveries on the bourses. ""Traders such as ourselves would get to know how much of a commodity is dematerialised (held in electronic form) and that would help,"" Chaturvedi said.
 
 However, Pukhraj Chopra, a grain merchant at Bikaner, said success of the proposed contracts would depend on their cost competitiveness to forwards executed between traders outside the exchange infrastructure. ""I pay just a brokerage cost for such a trade outside of the bourses.
 
 If I have to pay warehouse and grading and assaying charges, I would not use such contracts,"" Chopra said.
 
 Dilip Bhatia, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank-promoted Ace Commodity Exchange said the finer points were being thrashed out by the exchanges.
 
 However, FMC’s Abhishek feels traders would be assured of reliability, quality of produce and assured delivery that would negate concerns of traders like Chopra in the long run.
 
 A futures and forwards contract are similar to the extent that both allow a buyer or a seller to buy/sell a commodity at a predetermined price at a future date. However, a few differences exist. For instance, in a futures market, the counterparty is anonymous, while a forwards contract is struck between two parties known to each other. But, unlike in an OTC forwards contract, in the futures market, the counterparty default risk is borne by the exchange, a plus point when forwards are launched on the exchanges.
 
 Financial Technologies promoted-MCX, Renuka Sugars and LIC-held NCDEX, CWC-promoted NMCE, Ace, RADA-anchored ICEX and UCX are the six national commodity bourses.

We are reviewing shareholding guidelines: FMC chairman,"{""FMC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/we-are-reviewing-shareholding-guidelines-fmc-chairman/articleshow/30791114.cms,m.economictimes.com,We are reviewing shareholding guidelines: FMC chairman,"PANJIM: Commodities regulator Forward Markets Commission (FMC) today said it is considering modifications in the corporate governance norms and examining the shareholding guidelines. 

 ""We are looking at proposed modification in corporate governance, which needs to be transparent and strong. We are examining the shareholding pattern of exchanges and the role of anchor investor,"" FMC Chairman Ramesh Abhishek said here on the sidelines of Pulses Conclave 2014 here. 

 The plans follows the FMC decision wherein Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL) was deemed ""not fit and proper"" to run the Multi Commodity Exchange and the regulator ordered the reduction in FTIL stake to less than 2 per cent in MCX from the current level of 26 per cent. 

 The new round of proposals are being contemplated after the Rs 5,600-crore payment crisis at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) promoted by Financial Technologies. NSEL has stopped trading on its platform since August. 

 FMC and the government are contemplating capping shareholding of anchor investors in commodity exchanges to 15 per cent or even lower. 

 Also, in a move to achieve a diversified shareholding, the policy-makers plan to simplify rules on transfer of shares and relax restrictions on shareholders from trading on the bourse platform. 

 The regulator is also considering having a single depository for all the commodity exchanges. 

 ""We are examining that the clearing functions even without amendment of FCRA can be done by a common entity,"" Abhishek said, adding that FCRA amendment provides for setting up of a clearing corporation. 

 Post-NSEL crisis, capital market regulator Sebi has instructed CDSL and NSDL to stay away from clearing commodity trade. 

 NCDEX, which was using the services of CDSL, recently launched its own in-house depository resulting in lower cost for traders. 

 Commenting on how commodity exchanges can manage with a single clearing house when equity exchanges such as BSE and NSE have separate clearing corporation, Abhishek said: ""There are challenges, but the objective is to work out a solution for having a unified clearing corporation."" 

 The regulator is also increasing the staff strength and setting up a bigger office, he added.

 He however, said the hearing on petition challenging FMC order is coming up for hearing at the Bombay High Court tomorrow. 

 Sebi officials could not be reached for comments. Today's meeting followed a show cause notice issued by Sebi to Financial Technologies and others last month, soon after on December 18 commodities market regulator Forwards Markets Commission had said the group, its promoter Shah as well as senior executive Joseph Massey were not fit and proper to run any exchange. 

 The indictment came following a probe the FMC had conducted into the Rs 5,600 crore scam at the group promoted spot exchange NSEL which was shut since July 30 following trading of unlicensed forward instruments. 

 Sebi meeting relates to their 'fit and proper' status to run the group promoted stock exchange MCX-SX. 

 The FTIL group will have to reduce its shareholding in the stock exchange substantially if Sebi too declares the group and the promoter not 'fit and proper'. 

 The Sebi showcasue notice asked FTIL to explain why it should not be directed to divest its equity holdings and warrants in MCX-SX. 

 In its reply to the Sebi, the company said the regulator should wait till the matter is disposed of by the high court.

Are Europe-focused funds a good bet?,"{""Europe-focused funds"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/are-europe-focused-funds-a-good-bet/articleshow/29703481.cms,m.economictimes.com,Are Europe-focused funds a good bet?,"In the past few years, several international funds have been launched in India to take advantage of the market conditions abroad. In 2012 and 2013, the funds focused on the US were offered to capture the revival in that market. Now, with Europe poised for a turnaround, funds concentrating on this region are coming in the market. Religare Invesco Pan European Equity fund, JP Morgan European Dynamic Equity, and DWS Top Euroland Offshore are three such funds available now.

Why invest in Europe? 

The European equity markets appear attractive because the economy in the region is poised for a turnaround this year after a severe recession in the past few years. “The European economy contracted in 2012 and had zero growth in 2013.

It will probably grow 1-1.5% in 2014. Equity markets love situations where the macroeconomic environment is turning from negative to positive,” says Nandkumar Surti, CEO and MD, JP Morgan Asset Management. When the equity markets rise from depressed valuations of a recession, investors’ gains tend to be dramatic.

Corporate balance sheets within Europe are strengthening and the level of leverage is coming down, while retail spending is gathering momentum. Signs of international investors gaining confidence in the region are also evident.

Recently, Ireland, which had received a bailout package and then undergone fiscal consolidation, managed to raise $3.8 billion via a 10-year euro bond issue at 3.5%, a rate only marginally higher than that Germany would have paid.

Thus, investors are beginning to reward countries that have mended their finances.
Europe is one of the world’s largest economic blocs, accounting for 19% of the world GDP and home to 160 of Fortune 500 companies. An investor diversifying internationally can’t overlook this region.

The low correlation between the European and Indian markets also provides a good rationale.

When you invest in a market that has low correlation with the home market, your portfolio is better diversified. Moreover, the valuations of cyclical and financial stocks, and of those in peripheral European markets, are still low compared with historical averages and hold the potential to offer large gains.

The Europe-focused funds can be a vehicle for gaining exposure to global markets. “Many of the companies domiciled in Europe operate in markets across the globe and, hence, are not a play on the European economy alone,” says Vetri Subramanian, chief investment officer, Religare Invesco Mutual Fund.

What’s being offered?

The Religare Invesco Pan European Equity fund is a fund of funds (FoF) that will invest primarily in Invesco Pan European Equity fund. The mother fund has a 23-year track record, with the same pair of fund managers at the helm for the past 10.

The JP Morgan European Dynamic Equity Offshore fund is an FoF, whose mother fund, JPM Europe Dynamic, is a ‘best ideas fund’.

The fund managers are not constrained by sector, benchmark or geography. The fund has existed for 13 years and its current three managers have been there for the past eight years.

The DWS Top Euroland Offshore fund is not an NFO. From 9 January, the DWS Global Thematic Offshore fund has become DWS Top Euroland Offshore.

The mother fund changed from DWS Invest Global Thematic to DWS Invest Top Euroland.


	 
Risks and drawbacks

Investing in an international fund, including Europe-focused funds, carries a few risks, including the one stemming from currency. “At present, the returns from the US and European markets look attractive primarily because of the depreciation of the rupee,” says Rattan Chugh, director, Cornerstone Portfolio Services, a Gurgaon-based financial planning firm.

Having fallen about 35% over the past two-and-a-half years, and with the current account deficit under control, depreciation of a similar magnitude is unlikely to be repeated in the near future. Besides, international funds are taxed at par with debt funds. They don’t enjoy the favourable tax treatment that equity funds do. These FoFs also levy a 1% exit load if you redeem before 18 months. Invest in them only if you have a horizon of three to five years.

Who should invest and how much?

First, gain adequate exposure to all the asset classes in India. “Only high net worth individuals (HNIs) with adequate exposure to Indian assets, who want to diversify and are highly informed, should venture into Europe-focused funds,” says Prasunjit Mukherjee, a Kolkata-based mutual fund analyst. Depending on their risk appetites, HNIs should invest 15-20% of their equity assets in international funds.

Split this allocation between developed and developing markets, with a higher allocation to the former (due to lower correlation). Invest more in the US market, whose longterm growth prospects are likely to be better than that of Europe. About 30-40% of the developed market allocation can be to Europefocused funds.

	USD/JPY: Dollar-yen continues to make gains following the recent close above the 100-DMA with immediate focus on the Y103.02 May monthly high. Initial support is noted at Y102.25 where the 55-DMA also comes in with bears needing a close below to ease the current bullish pressure. 


	Overall a close back below the Y101.89 level is needed to confirm an end to bullish hopes and see bears looking for closes below the 200-DMA to add weight to the bearish case. 


	EUR/JPY: Tuesday's move higher saw the pair close above the 21-DMA which adds support to the bullish case and sees immediate focus shift to layers of resistance in the Y140.27-99 region where key moving averages are located. Overall bulls need a close above the Y140.99 May 13 high to end bearish hopes and target 2014 highs. 


	Bears now need a close below the Y139.36 support to signal a false break higher and target last week's low. 


	Australian Dollar Summary: Aussie dollar had a mixed day Wednesday with much of the positive coming from the stronger than expected Q1 GDP data, which came in at +1.1% qoq and +3.5% yoy (vs. MNI Median at +1.0% and +3.3%). Aussie had been quietly sliding lower all morning until the release, but immediately jumped from $0.9260 to $0.9299, where sellers emerged off the level where, on Monday, the weaker April Building Approvals data had seen the market plummet. 


	Further analysis and Economist commentary focused on the +0.9% added by mining exports, with a weaker picture in the backdrop. After looking to consolidate at the $0.9280 level, the pair slipped in lunchtime trade as the USD rose against the majors, with the pair eventually back to the $0.9260 mark where it had all began. 


	 

	However, the overall picture remains that GDP growth, wherever it has come from, is at +3.5%, and inflation is on the high side of the RBA's target range. AUD began a slow climb back to it's current level of $0.9271, up just 5bps on the day, midpoint of the $0.9253/0.9299 range for the day. 


	Sterling Summary: Cable closed in NY Tuesday at $1.6749 after rate had corrected back from early session highs of $1.6782 to $1.6731. Rate recovered to $1.6756 into the London fix before it settled around $1.6750 into the close. 


	Cable marked highs in early Asian trade at $1.6752 before turning lower as strong demand for dollar-yen emerged, which in turn prompted general dollar strength. Cable eased to an initial low of $1.6720, recovered to $1.6730 before extending lows to $1.6719 ahead of the European open. Rate currently trades around $1.6724.


	Euro-sterling, which had seen a sharp bounce off lows of stg0.8105 to stg0.8148 on reported ECB fix demand Tuesday, consolidated this move between stg0.81345-0.8142 in Asia. UK services PMI (0830GMT) the morning domestic focus with EZ GDP and PPI following at 0900GMT. 


	However, trade expected to remain range bound ($1.6693-1.6782) ahead of Thursday's ECB rate/monetary policy announcement. Cable demand seen into $1.6714 (76.4% $1.6693-1.6782) ahead of stronger area between $1.6695/90. Resistance $1.6752 (50% $1.6782-19; $1.6758 61.8%; $1.6767 76.4%), with stronger interest at $1.6782 (Jun3 high/50-dma). Euro-sterling in an outside range of stg0.8080/0.8170. 


	GBP/USD: Cable is starting to look a little heavy following Tuesday's failed rally with the $1.6785 level now seen as initial resistance. Layers of resistance are noted in the 1.6815-81 region which should slow any further rallies for now as bearish focus firmly dominates. Bears remain focused on the 100-DMA and a break below which then targets March and April monthly lows. 


	Dollar-Asia Summary: Dollar regional currencies remain supported in Asian session after further short covering during US session, while regional stocks snapped yesterday's gains.

DTC will not impact foreign investor fund inflows,"{""DTC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/dtc-will-not-impact-foreign-investor-fund-inflows/articleshow/6056714.cms,m.economictimes.com,DTC will not impact foreign investor fund inflows,"
  MUMBAI: Foreign portfolio investors will not be materially impacted by the proposed changes in the new tax code, as long as these funds are able to claim tax credit in their home jurisdictions, say experts. 
  
  Another factor likely to mitigate the impact of the new tax rule is that India remains one of the fastest growing economies globally, and is likely to attract a sizeable chunk of the flows coming out of other troubled markets.
  
  The proposed rule seeks to tax foreign portfolio investors’ revenues from equity investments in India under capital gains tax, instead of under business income. 
  
  Business income is income that arises from the regular operations of a company, and hence are taxed at a lower rate. Capital gains are those that arise out of the sale of assets such as land, gold or in the case of FIIs-equity holdings, and hence attract a higher tax.
  
  “The rule is likely to impact very few foreign funds,” says Sukumar Rajah, MD & CIO-Asian Equities, Franklin Templeton Investments.
  
  Suresh Swamy, ED, Financial Services, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has similar views. “As of today, there is only a small universe of FIIs which claim their income to be business income. Most of them adopt a capital gains stand. FIIs/sub-accounts were entitled to claim treaty benefits only if they satisfied certain conditions. Not all of them satisfied those conditions,” he says.
  
  Mauritius-based institutions continue to be taxed under Mauritius laws, which exempt them from capital gains tax. India has a taxation treaty with Mauritius which is used to save on tax by foreign funds.
  
  “For those who come in from a treaty jurisdiction, there would be little or no impact at all. But those who were from non-treaty jurisdictions and were relying on this being categorised as business income, could be impacted,” says Siddharth Shah, head-funds practice, Nishith Desai Associates. 
  
  “It’s ironical in some sense that such change combined with higher tax rate on capital gains may actually investors push to look at investing through treaty jurisdictions with capital gains benefits,” he says.
  
  He, however, cautions investors that one needs to watch out for GAAR provisions and applicability of the same to structures. “While the draft has removed the treaty override provisions proposed under the old draft, one will get a clear picture only when detailed GAAR rules are announced,” he told ET.
  
  Shefali Goradia, partner, BMR Advisors, believes it is aspirational for the government to curb treaty shopping by invoking GAAR. “Most other countries have not succeeded in doing this. If the tax officers challenge the Mauritius treaty due to lack of substance, this can be challenged before the courts,” she adds.
  
  Punit Shah, ED-tax & regulatory services (financial services) KPMG says that the certainty of availability of the capital gains tax exemption under Mauritius tax treaty is crucial for foreign investors. 
  
  “Even though, the discussion paper provides for beneficial provisions of the treaty to prevail, it is subject to passing anti-abuse provision tests, the application of which itself is not objectively provided for. This brings uncertainty and subjectivity in applying the beneficial tax treaty provisions,” he said.

 Prior to that, Axis MF and SBI MF had filed their respective draft papers with Sebi to launch retirement-linked mutual fund. 

 DSP Blackrock' Retirement Benefit Pension Fund, an open-ended mutual fund retirement-linked plan, will invest in equity and debt. 

 ""The investment objective of the schemes is to provide pension to an investor in the form of income/cash flow to the extent of redemption value of their holding after the age of 60 years by investing in a mix of securities comprising equity, equity-related instruments and/or debt/money market instruments,"" DSP Blackrock said in its draft papers. 

 Axis MF had filed draft papers with Sebi in November, while SBI MF had done so in August. 

 At present, only two fund houses have retirement-linked pension plans - Franklin Templeton Pension Fund and UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Fund. 

 As per the Budget, retirement funds floated by fund houses have been given tax benefits in line with pension funds to attract long-term domestic savings into the equity market.

Pramod Bhasin to head DLF's rental business,"{""DLF"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/pramod-bhasin-to-head-dlfs-rental-business/articleshow/29517273.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pramod Bhasin to head DLF's rental business,"By: Raviteja Sharma 

 NEW DELHI: Pramod Bhasin, the man who set up General Electric’s outsourcing business to India, is being appointed as the chairman of the rental business of DLF, the country’s biggest builder, as the latter plans to consolidate its rental assets into Rentco and list it as a REIT or real estate investment trust in the future. 

 A REIT is a type of security that is sold like a stock on an exchange and invests and owns real estate assets that produce a stable rental income for shareholders. The advent of REITs will give builders an opportunity to monetise their income-producing assets. 

 DLF’s assets generate rents worth Rs2,000 crore a year and a new company owning these assets could be valued at around Rs20,000 crore at least, according to top executives of the company. Bhasin set up GE Capital International Services or Gecis, renamed Genpact, in Gurgaon after DLF promoter KP Singh convinced the then GE boss Jack Welch to start outsourcing work from the US to India. Bhasin was inducted onto the DLF board as a non-executive independent director in August last year. “The company now wants to leverage his experience in the BPO, outsourcing and IT businesses to make the rental business a self-sustaining model, by either taking it for an IPO or listing it as a REIT,” said one of the executives cited above.
 
 
  
 Most of DLF’s 25 million sq ft of leased assets, which include offices and malls, have been rented to IT and outsourcing entities. 

 A spokesman for DLF said, “Bhasin joined us a few months ago as an independent director on the board of DLF. Since he comes from the IT/ ITeS background, we look forward to his guidance in all aspects of business.” 

 He declined to share details. Bhasin could not be reached for comment. The company’s board is likely to take up the appointment of Bhasin at its next meeting, both the sources said. 

 After spending over 25 years at GE, Bhasin set up an in-house BPO division Gecis in 1997. Gecis took up space in offices set up by DLF. Around that time, other technology firms and large MNCs began outsourcing business to India, and much of this investment came to Gurgaon. DLF was a big beneficiary of this trend as it was already building offices and homes in the area. 

 Over the past few years, DLF has categorised its businesses into two segments — development side, which is in the business of building and selling assets such as homes, and rental side, which builds and leases out assets such as offices and malls. “Going forward the company wants to make the two independent of each other so that they both generate their own free cash,” said one of the sources. Bhasin’s entry is being seen as part of the process of making the rental business an independent vertical within DLF. 

 Almost 80 per cent of the rental assets are housed in a company called DLF Cyber City Developers while some others, mostly malls, are in other companies. Over the course of the next two years, all rental assets will be merged into one entity that will be spun off as a listed company or as a REIT as and when the government puts in place a tax code for the new instrument. 

 Worldwide, REITs get special tax considerations. In India, stock market regulator Sebi recently issued draft guidelines for REITs, after having put the move on hold in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. “After the new government enacts a tax code for REITs in line with those applicable globally, we will decide which way to go,” said one company executive.

  The board’s contention is that the previous management, under the leadership of Amitabh Chaturvedi, spent enormous amount of money without following proper procedures, which had triggered the departure of Chaturvedi.

 The 30-share BSE benchmark ended at 21,209.73 today. The Sensex is trading at 14x (in line with long-term average), and we expect 15 per cent EPS growth for Sensex in FY15. We have a Sensex target of 24,000 for December, at which Sensex will trade at 15.8x, in line with average of past five years, Deutsche said in a report.
 
 This is in line with the MSCI India which is also trading at 14.1x, while its premium to MSCI Asia-ex-Japan has come down marginally to 29 per cent from 32 per cent in January, the report said.
 
 The Indian market outperformed most of its key emerging market (EM) peers like Thailand and Indonesia in February, with the Sensex rising 3 per cent in the month and 1 per cent YTD for the year, it said.
 
 Deutsche said the market is driven by decreasing likelihood of a fractured verdict in the general elections, both WPI and CPI inflation dipping by more than 100 bps in January MoM and improving global risk appetite.
 
 In dollar terms, the Sensex was among the top performing indices globally as the rupee appreciated 1.5 per cent on improving risk sentiment for EM assets.
 
 The BSE capital goods index was the top performing sector (+9.4 per cent), followed by autos (+8.9 per cent) and healthcare (+7.2 per cent), while key underperformers were metals (-5.4 per cent), realty (-0.7 per cent), FMCG (-0.5 per cent) and oil & gas (-0.3 per cent).
 
 The report pointed out that in February, fiscal discipline continued, vote-on-account desisted from populism and diesel prices hiked despite concerns to contrary.
 
 In the interim Budget, the Government commendably desisted from populist measures (like farm loan waiver in an election year), endorsing commitment to fiscal consolidation.
 
 Similarly, the latest diesel price hike announced last week sent a strong signal that calibrated fuel price rationalisation will continue, the brokerage said.
 
 The report said FII inflows have revived for equities and continued strongly for debt. FII flows in equities, which had turned mildly negative in January, turned around last month, with India witnessing USD 322 million inflows, second only to Indonesia among the emerging Asian peers.

Crude reserves filling to begin after March 2016,"{""Crude"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/crude-reserves-filling-to-begin-after-march-2016/articleshow/50114732.cms,m.economictimes.com,Crude reserves filling to begin after March 2016,"NEW DELHI: The process of filling India’s two new strategic petroleum reserves could begin only after March as pipelines connecting the caverns to the port are yet to be laid, a top executive of state-run Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve (ISPRL) has said. 

 India, which imports 80% of its crude oil requirement, has built three strategic reserves to store crude oil that could help guard against potential energy supply disruption. A sharp drop in crude oil prices has been another incentive for the country to quickly build and fill these reserves before prices start rising again. Benchmark Brent and US crude futures are now trading near $40 a barrel. 

 Its first reserve in Vishakhapatnam with a storage capacity of 1.3 million tonne (mt) has already been filled at a cost of Rs 2,700 crore. The other two reserves at Mangalore and Padur in Karnataka, with a combined capacity of 4 mt, too are ready to take crude oil but the proposed pipelines connecting them with the landfall point are yet to be laid, delaying the project by a further six months. 

 The pipelines, long delayed due to landowners’ protest, will now be ready by March, said the ISPRL executive, requesting anonymity. 

 ISPRL is responsible for building and managing these reserves that could act as a buffer for more than a month in case oil supplies to the country are disrupted. The government also plans to build four more reserves with a combined capacity of 12.5 mt in the second phase. 

 The executive said the deadlock with landowners was resolved after the company agreed to pay them a higher compensation for right of use. Laying pipelines have been contentious in India as farmers and companies can’t quickly agree on compensation and local politics further vitiates the atmosphere, delaying projects for years and putting investments at risk. 

 ISPRL needs to lay a 12.8 km pipeline between the port and the Mangalore cavern, of which about 8.6 km has been laid so far. Barely half a kilometer of pipeline has been built on the 36-km segment between the valve station and the Padur Cavern.

Crisil believes the index will provide market participants an appropriate and easily accessible benchmark to measure and analyse the performance of such securities, the agency said in a statement.  	That apart, this total return index seeks to capture returns on inflation-linked securities due to coupon accruals and price change, both adjusted for inflation.  	The launch comes as part of Crisil's ongoing effort to develop and maintain representative indices for the debt market. In addition to this index, the agency currently maintains 37 indices across bond, gilts, money market, hybrid and commodity segments, which are used by asset managers for benchmarking their products and portfolios.  	Agency president Mukesh Agarwal said: ""The launch of the index further endorses the agency's status as a pioneer in debt and hybrid indices in the country. This index is expected to serve both as a benchmark and underlying index for investment products such as index funds.  	""Crisil will continue to develop indices that help market participants gauge the performance of different asset classes and make investment decisions in an otherwise shallow debt market,"" he said.  	Currently, there is one such security, the 1.44 per cent inflation indexed government stock 2023 (linked to wholesale price index) issued in June 2013. Such securities provide inflation protection on both principal and coupon (interest) payments.  	It may be noted that the agency already provides daily valuation of government securities, including mutual funds for determination of net asset value of funds, to investors.  	Senior director for capital markets Sandeep Sabharwal said, ""We believe the Crisil IIGS Index will meet the need for an appropriate benchmark index for these funds.""  	He further noted that since its launch in 2013, the inflation-linked government security has gained some popularity in the mutual funds space. Two inflation-linked funds have already been launched and a few are in the pipeline.  "

 The company also expects to turn profitable in two years. ""The online real estate segment is growing rapidly, mainly due to the penetration of internet and increase in usage of smartphones...to further expand our business, we might go public in the next 3-5 years,"" company's Co-founder and CEO Sumit Jain told PTI here. 

 He did not, however, disclose how much the company expects to raise. 

 ""We have been raising funds through various investors and utilising it for creating new products, investing in technology and data gathering. We will be further investing in these three areas to make the platform more robust,"" he said, adding the venture will turn profitable in next two years. 

 The company recently launched two services including CF Retina, which gives virtual experience of the property, and live-in tours in which customers can take a complete virtual tour of the property. 

 ""We plan to roll out live in tours in 17 more cities in the next one month. We currently have 15,000 properties listed through live-in tours and plans to list five lakh rental and resale units under the virtual tour feature in the next six months,"" Jain said. 

 The company has about 10 million homes across 200 cities listed on its portal. 

 The Bengaluru-based firm has so far raised over USD 60 million from Accel Partners, Tiger Global and Google Capital. 

 ""We are looking to turn profitable in the next two years. About 220,000 properties are listed on the site every month. We are well capitalised and have over half of the money raised till now in the bank. We believe in spending on innovation development which enhances customer experience,"" he said. 

 Last year, the company had acquired Flat.to, a real estate service that helps students and bachelors find flats, paying guest accommodation and hostels across Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Kota, Jaipur and Delhi. 

 With the acquisition Commonfloor.com could cater to a new segment -- students and bachelors, Jain said.

  MUMBAI: The quantity of farm and precious metal products delivered on commodity bourses NCDEX and MCX last year increased by over 36% and 20%, respectively, from a year ago, according to ETIG data. This shows that large trading houses, food, bullion and metal companies are using the seven-year-old market for raw material trading.
  
  While most companies are reluctant to reveal their risk management practices, most believe it is a good development. “Rising deliveries are a good sign..... we need commodity exchanges for the orderly development of the markets. Their role in price discovery helps farmers take a decision on sowing based on the best realisation available for a particular crop. That said, I think the exchange needs to align its delivery mechanism for soyabean and soya oil with that for mustard seed, which has witnessed the highest delivery last year,” said Atul Chaturvedi, CEO of Adani Wilmar, manufacturer of the Fortune brand of edible oil, and a hedger on NCDEX.
  
  Attracted by the rise in volumes in commodity futures, some companies buying raw materials from physical market are now willing to look at the option of taking a membership in a commodity board.
  
  “Future Agrovet, which sources all agri commodity requirements for Future Group stores, is evaluating the opportunity of trading on local commodity exchanges as part of our treasury function,” said Damodar Mall, director (food strategy), Future Group, India’s largest retailer. “We are not interested in buying from or selling on the exchanges... but since we have an underlying exposure, we may consider covering the same.” 
  
  Top jewellery companies say bullion futures enable them to better manage their risk amid increased volatility in the metals. “What I buy on the physical market, I sell on the exchange and what I sell to a retailer, I buy on the exchange,” said Umesh Shah, vice president (domestic jewellery division) Shrenuj & Co. “So, if the price rises or falls, I gain in one market and lose in the other, in effect neutralising my price risk. If used wisely, this facility can benefit corporates.” Apart from actual users, increased participation by high net-worth clients is also said to be one of the reasons for deliveries trending up not just in gold but also in a few agri counters, according to Jayant Manglik, president, Religare Commodities. 
  
  “Apart from bullion, HNI clients are steadily learning the intricacies of trading in farm products, factors like seasonality and validity of stocks. Equipped with this knowledge they can buy cheap on the spot market and deliver on the futures market or vice versa and earn a neat spread,” said Manglik.

Commexes extended trade hours hit a roadblock,"{""Commexes"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/commexes-extended-trade-hours-hit-a-roadblock/articleshow/34706730.cms,m.economictimes.com,Commexes’ extended trade hours hit a roadblock,"MUMBAI: Commodity exchanges like NCDEX and Kotak-promoted Ace may be facing a potential hurdle to their plans of increasing volumes by launching extended trade hours in select farm products since the past month. 

 Forward Markets Commission (FMC), which regulates commodity futures trading, has asked the six national-level bourses led by NCDEX for a report on the socalled “evening trade” that began in April after having received complaints from vegetable oil trading bodies, a commodity exchange official said. The nub of the argument of oil associations like Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), which represents companies such as Ruchi Soya and Adani Wilmar, and Central Organisation of Oil Industry and Trade (COOIT) is that increased trading hours in itself won’t help the exchanges attract more participation and raise volumes. 

 Physical markets close at 5 pm and continuation of futures trading after that would deform the market as no physical trade takes place after business hours, they contended. “Understandably, the objective of extended trade timing may be increased volumes at the domestic exchanges,” Vijay Data, president of SEA, wrote in a letter to FMC. 

 “However, until the banking hours are extended to match/honour the trades, the element of hedging by the trade participants would decrease and the element of speculation may go on an incremental trend, which may not be in the bona fide interest of the stakeholders in general,” he wrote. Ramesh Abhishek, chairman of FMC, could not be reached for comment. 

 The reason the commission allowed extended trade hours from 5 pm to 11:30 pm from Monday through Friday was to enable genuine users to hedge their positions in farm commodities with international linkages like soya oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, sugar and cotton in line with users of gold, silver, base metals and energy. 

 According to some commodity market brokers, the real reason for the trade bodies’ grouse was their loss of pricing power. A transparent and national-level pricing mechanism disseminated through the futures market would diminish processors’ hold on prices, they said. 

 Justifying extended trading, an NCDEX official said, “In case of price movement in international markets after domestic bourses closed, market participants here were not in aposition to manage their cash market position and the price risk associated with fluctuation in price, as the formal markets were closed. They were exposed to the risk of a price gap opening on the domestic markets the following day.” This person contended that evening trading has greatly reduced the basic risk of local players by facilitating more efficient alignment of the domestic prices with the international prices. 

 In their complaint to FMC, trade bodies have also contended that internationally, exchanges like Bursa Malaysia, the benchmark for palm oil, and China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange, one of the benchmarks for soya bean and soya oil, operate for five and four hours, respectively. In contrast, exchanges like NCDEX operated currently for 13.5 hours, from 10 am to 11.30 pm, which was stretching the financial and physical resources of traders. 

 Brokers such as Suresh Nair of Admisi Commodities and Viral Shah of Geojit Comtrade, however, said electronic platforms of exchanges such as Globex, another benchmark for soya bean, remained open for virtually 24 hours, making the industry’s contention of exchanges operating for only a few hours not entirely correct.

Coffee Day IPO: Should you subscribe or avoid?,"{""Coffee Day"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/coffee-day-ipo-should-you-subscribe-or-avoid/articleshow/49334515.cms,m.economictimes.com,Coffee Day IPO: Should you subscribe or avoid?,"NEW DELHI: Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL) owns the coffee chain – Café Coffee Day, which as a brand is not new to you and me and can very well be a good play to ride India’s rising consumption story.
 
 The company also has diversified business interests through 40 subsidiaries across segments like logistics, financial services, hospitality and technology parks.
 
 Over the years, the company has been successful in creating a strong brand on its own without any international tieup. Its market share in terms of number of chained café outlets stood at 46 per cent as of December 31, 2014, brokerage Angel Broking said in a report.
 
 The initial public offering of Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL) to raise Rs 1,150 crore opened for subscription on Wednesday. The price band of the issue has been fixed at Rs 316-328 a share. The issue will close on Friday, October 16.
 
 The entire issue is of fresh equity issue, and the company will use the proceeds to (a) finance the expansion of its coffee business; (b) repay and pre-pay loans for the parent as well as subsidiaries; and (c) meet general corporate needs.
 
 Currently, the promoters hold 63.3 per cent in the company, which will come down to 52.6 per cent post-issue at the upper end of the price band at Rs 328.
 
 Most brokerage firms believe the valuations are somewhat expensive and a bit stretched, but it can be a good stock to play the consumption story. Investors who have a mid-term to long-term horizon can look at subscribing to the issue.
 
 One of the reasons why some of the brokerage firms like the IPO is the fact that it would be a direct play on India’s rising consumption story. “Led by the confluence of rising income levels, rich demographic profile and increasing aspirations, the share of spending in the discretionary category is likely to improve,” brokerage Sharekhan said in a report.
 
 Retailing consultant Technopak said the size of the organised café market is estimated to be Rs 6,700 crore in 2014 and is projected to grow to Rs 15,100 crore by 2020, rising at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 per cent.
 
 
We have collated the views of various brokerage firms on Coffee Day IPO:
 
 

 
 
Angel Broking: Neutral 
 
 Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL), on a consolidated basis, reported 30 per cent CAGR growth in revenue over FY2010-15 to Rs 2,479cr. On the Ebitda front, the company reported a 26 per cent growth CAGR over the same period.
 
 “CDEL has diversified across various businesses, which however have failed to deliver impressive financial performances so far. Considering negligible profits/reported losses of subsidiaries and the complex holding structure of the company, we are of the view that the IPO is priced at a slightly higher valuation,” the brokerage said.
 
 “Thus, we recommend a neutral rating on the issue. Investors having conviction in the long-term growth prospects of the company and wanting to tap this perceived opportunity could consider waiting for a possible correction in the stock price post IPO listing,” it said.
 
 
HEM Securities: Avoid
 
 The company is bringing in the issue at a price band of Rs 316-328 per share at a price-to-book value ratio of approx 3.92-4.07 and a post-issue book value of approximately Rs 80.53 per share. Though the company has strong promoter background, brand name and pan-India presence, but looking at the valuations, the issue looks steeply priced at present level.
 
 Also, the company has posted consecutive losses over the past few years, which doesn't give confidence for investment in the short term. However, in the long term one can invest when the company starts posting profits. Hence we recommend ‘avoid’ on issue.
 
 
Sharekhan: Only for long-term investors
 
 At the higher end of the issue price, adjusting for the valuation of the listed plays like MindTree, the coffee business is available at 25-26 times its FY2015 EV/Ebitda, which is in line with some of the listed comparable companies and thus is not cheap.
 
 However, given the strong brand image, extensive distribution reach and growing disposable income in India, the company is an attractive play on urban discretionary consumption and investors can look at it with a mid- to long-term investment horizon.
 
 
ICICI Securities: Subscribe
 
 “We believe CDEL, on the back of the Café Coffee Day business, would be a major beneficiary of the revival in urban discretionary consumption. At the price band of Rs 316-328, a target market cap and EV would be Rs 6,756 crore and Rs 10,510 crore, respectively, at the upper end of the price band,” the brokerage said.
 
 Given that the investment value of the IT, logistics, real estate and hospitality businesses is Rs 5,025 crore, the coffee business is available at 4.3 times EV/sales, which is at a 15 per cent discount to global coffee chain Starbucks. We recommend subscribe.

ET Now: It stayed okay for the large caps at least and again two days in a row, we have had the Nifty and the Sensex outperforming the broader markets. Do the charts suggest anything?  

 
Ashwani Gujral: Today there is a bit of sector rotation, which means banks are kind of letting off a bit of steam and CNX IT is coming back to hold the market. One more important thing is that the action on Hindustan Unilever, a sort of bad news, just tells you about the strength of the stock and on this sort of news if the stock can move up, then the market is underestimating how high the stock could go. So because of that it is a worthwhile buy now and chances are we will make new highs on this shortly.

CLSA picks top 12 investment themes for 2014,"{""CLSA"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/clsa-picks-top-12-investment-themes-for-2014/articleshow/28552441.cms,m.economictimes.com,CLSA picks top 12 investment themes for 2014,"
	MUMBAI: Global brokerage firm CLSA is of the view that policy reforms initiated by the UPA government in the last 15 months will have positive impact on the economy in 2014 and a decisive government post elections will only accelerate the process of economic recovery,


	""We believe that the falling trend in GDP growth, investment growth and corporate earnings growth will reverse during 2014. The improvement will be likely visible in 2HCY14/FY15,"" said CLSA report titled 'Trend Reversal'.


	While the brokerage limits its Sensex target at 23,500 for December 2014, it believes that money will be made in cyclical sectors and in select stocks.


	""We highlight five investment themes for 2014 i) continuous improvement in policy environment ii) Greater investor patience for ‘Growth recovery’ plays iii) inflation & interest rates stabilising at higher level (after the expected dip in food inflation in Dec 13) driving gradual rupee depreciation iv) Rising asset/balance sheet utilization driving pricing power and v) deleveraging,"" the report said.


	CLSA is 'Overweight' on corporate lenders, consumer discretionary, utilities and mid-cap property to play the above themes.


	Its top stock ideas for 2014 are:


	Axis Bank


	We expect Axis’ earnings to surprise positively in FY14 and also report a healthy ~18-20 per cent CAGR over FY14-16. Earnings will be led by growth in retail segment. Its loan growth will be led by retail and SME segments as the bank focuses on improving its cross-sell ratios. We expect manageable pressure on the credit quality with gross NPL rising from 1.2 per cent of loans now to 3.4 per cent by Mar-16 and credit costs stabilising near 110bps of loans.


	However, the rise in credit costs will be offset by healthy topline growth and cost efficiencies. Axis is well placed to leverage recent capital raising and ROE should expand by 200-300bps to 18 per cent in FY16. We maintain Axis among our High-Conviction BUYs.


	Bharti Airtel


	Bharti Airtel’s valuations have caught up with multiple issues of slowing growth, high regulatory burden and a weak balance sheet, and we believe the risk-reward is now turning favourable. We believe the stock should outperform the market as mobile pricing pressure in India has abated, data ramp-up is at an inflection point, its Africa operations have stabilised and valuations appear to have factored in regulatory risks.


	HCL Tech


	In the past 24 months, HCL’s stock performance has been entirely earnings led with stock not seeing any re-rating despite the superior performance. HCL’s PE has been capped by fears around concentration of growth in infra services, doubts on sustainability of margins and potential business disruption post change in the CEO. This has thrown up a nice risk-reward for the stock as investors are giving a lower PE on suppressed earnings estimates.
	 

	 

	A section of the street has also been worried on quarterly disclosures being below industry standards. HCL has sought to correct some

	of this anxiety through improved financial disclosures starting 1QFY14. We see more legs to HCL’s consistent financial performance driving stock upsides hereon. We rate the stock Outperform.


	ICICI Bank


	Over FY14-16, we expect ICICI Bank to report slight uptick in earnings growth to 17 per cent CAGR compared to 16 per cent growth in FY14. The earnings growth will be led by topline growth and cost efficiencies that will compensate for rise in credit costs to 100bps of loans. While we expect rise in gross NPLs from 3 per cent now to +4 per cent in FY16, we don’t expect material deterioration to its large corporate portfolio because we foresee efforts to deleveraging of balance sheet to show results over next 12-18 months.


	Healthy earnings growth, manageable asset quality and improvement in ROE to 18 per cent (16-17 per cent now) will support re-rating of valuations. We maintain ICICI among our High- Conviction BUYs.


	ITC


	Strong positioning in cigarette provides high earnings visibility for ITC, which is the key in the current uncertain times and places ITC over peers.
	 

	Cigarette business continues to be the bedrock of ITC business model where the company enjoys strong pricing power in a stable industry structure.


	We believe that the worst is also behind for non-cigarette business (particularly hotels and paperboards) which have been reeling under pressure; new FMCG business is also set to turnaround in 2HFY14. The recent 15 per cent correction from peak provides an opportunity to BUY ITC which trades close at 25x FY15 earnings, which is at a discount to peers like HUL and justifiable given the stable and predictable earnings stream.


	Jaiprakash Power Ventures


	JPVL has one of the best project portfolios among Indian IPPs. Commissioning of Nigrie would be a key earnings driver for the company in near term. The company is also in talks to sell part of its hydro portfolio to bring down its debt. The transaction (if it happens) would remove a big overhang from the JPVL stock as the company would be able to reduce its gearing considerably and would be able to fund the balance requirements of Nigrie and Bara.


	Lupin


	An increasing number of niche product launches will result in strong growth in Lupin’s US generics business. This coupled with consistent above average growth in India will drive 21 per cent profit CAGR over FY13-16CL with potential upgrades from the US business. We believe valuations will sustain courtesy strong earnings growth and improving return ratios. We rate the stock BUY with Rs 1,075 target based on 21x one-year forward PE, a marginal premium to the sector average.


	Maruti Suzuki


	Maruti is our top pick in Indian autos led by strong company specific triggers over FY15-16 - 1) Rich line-up of new product launches, 2)

	Improvement in exports volumes, and 3) Margin expansion led by rising localization.
	 

	 

	We believe that the worst phase of competition is now behind and the company is well positioned to benefit from any demand recovery in the passenger vehicle industry. We see Maruti’s total volumes rising at a healthy 11 per cent CAGR over FY14-16 and expect the company to deliver a robust 28 per cent EPS CAGR over this period.


	Power Grid Corporation


	Power Grid Corporation, India's national transmission utility, is now trading close to its all-time low PE and PB multiples. The company earns a regulated return of 15.5 per cent on equity invested in transmission projects which is not affected by power demand-supply, coal shortages or delays in commissioning of generation projects.


	This has allowed the company to report steady earnings CAGR of over 20 per cent over last 3-5 years. Given its project pipeline we expect 14-16 per cent EPS CAGR over next 3-5 years. Attractive valuations, high earnings predictability and growth outlook are the key BUY arguments for Power Grid.


	Prestige Estates


	Amongst weakness in property markets across India, Bengaluru has stood out as the most resilient city as the city’s technology industry based economy continues to do well. Prestige Estates has the largest portfolio of Bengaluru offices amongst listed developers and with lease income matching interest outgo, capital structure is fairly de-risked.


	Its residential sales have shown strong growth over last three years and as the same get reflected in P&L during 2014, we will see Prestige’s earnings grow by 50 per cent YoY in FY15. Stock is attractive at 11x one year forward earnings.


	UltraTech Cement


	After a challenging FY14 characterized by muted demand growth along with pricing pressures, we believe that the profitability has bottomed out and there would be a gradual recovery over the next two years on the back of demand pick-up and moderate capacity expansions. The market leader, UltraTech should be an obvious beneficiary of this, which is also in the process of expanding its capacity (in phases) during FY14.


	This should drive a volume growth ahead of the largecaps peers in FY15-16. Following a 10 per cent Y-o-Y decline in earnings in FY14, we believe the base is also supportive. Over FY14-16, we expect a 25 per cent CAGR in earnings. Valuations at 16.5x FY15CL earnings are sustainable.


	Zee Entertainment


	Zee continues to benefit from a surge in domestic subscriptions driven by digitisation - which should continue in 2014 as deadline for Phase III of digitization roll out is set for Dec’14. While ad revenue macros are weak, Zee should outperform the industry as market shares of key channels is resilient and investment in content / new channels starts paying off.


	We expect an earnings CAGR of 22 per cent over FY14-16 with ad revenue growth built in at 13-14 per cent range – not assuming any substantial macro pick-up. Visibility on earnings growth staying high, cash generation remaining strong, balance sheet being net cash and management committed to increasing return of cash to shareholders, higher multiples are achievable.

  NEW DELHI: The country's biggest initial public float, touted as a tool for financial inclusion and bringing households in the hinterland into equity culture, has been spurned by the very people it was supposed to benefit. Despite a discount, employees of state-run Coal India Ltd appear to be aloof to over six million shares set aside for them due to apprehensions that the “partial privatisation” - as they call the IPO - will lead to job losses.
  
  Company chairman Partho S Bhattacharya admitted on Tuesday the 6.31 million shares set aside for employees may not be fully subscribed and will be reallocated to investors. “We offered (employees) so many shares because we thought that if the company today is what it is, it is because of the employees .” He said qualified institutional buyers have already subscribed to their portion of the offer. Trading may start from November 4.
  
  Coal secretary C Balakrishnan too said there may be leftovers from the employee part since the trade unions were not supporting the IPO. Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a trade union with almost a million members according to its website, is discouraging employees from buying shares. The union held a nationwide strike on Monday to oppose the sale. According to union leaders, the IPO is the first step toward privatisation which they feel will also bring “job insecurity”.
  
  Institutional investors have flocked to the offering on expectations that Coal India stands to benefit from surging power demand in Asia's second-fastest growing economy. Coal India has so far received at least Rs 11,470 crore of bids.

 The move is in line with market regulator Sebi's decision in July to hike the minimum investment size for any equity derivative product to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2 lakh, to help safeguard small investors from high-risk products. 

 ""In pursuance of Sebi guidelines on review of minimum contract size in equity derivatives segment...the market lots of foreign index derivatives contracts shall be revised,"" BSE said in a circular. 

 The market lots, which refers to the number of contracts contained in one derivative security, has been changed for -- FTSE/JSE Top 40 Futures, Hang Seng Index Futures, Micex Index Futures and iBovespa Futures. 

 The stock exchange has increased the lot size of FTSE/ JSE Top 40 Futures to 15 from 10 and would be applicable for new generated and existing contracts, from September 18. FTSE/ JSE index tracks South Africa's 40 highest ranking companies. 

 Derivative contracts lots on MICEX Index Futures, which is related to 30 stocks of the major and rapidly developing Russian issuers, has been doubled to 300, with effect from September 16. The revised lot would apply for newly generated and existing contracts. 

 Further, BSE has revised upwards the lot size for Hang Seng Index Futures from 15 to 20. These new market lots for derivatives contracts based on the index measuring the largest and most liquid stocks in Hong Kong, would be applicable for November 2015 and subsequent expiries, from September 30. 

 For iBovespa Futures, based on index measuring the Brazilian stock market, lots has been increased two times to 10, from October 15. These lots would be for new generated and existing contracts, BSE said. 

 In 2011, Sebi had permitted stock exchanges to introduce futures and options contracts on foreign stock indices in the equity derivatives segment. 

 A derivative is a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured or any other form of security. It also derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, of underlying securities.

""The stock exchanges, including BSE, need to change their business model and promote investment-based trading and help in capital formation to generate funds for investments across various sectors,"" BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan said.  BSE, which is the world's largest exchange in terms of listed companies and figures among top-ten globally on various other parameters, is also planning to foray into commodity exchange segment, for which it has got Sebi's approval and further work is in progress.  ""We have got approval from the Sebi and from our board. The Sebi approval is to invest in a commodity exchange. However, we are yet to approach the commodity markets regulator FMC for their approval.  ""The application process takes a long time and once we submit the application to the FMC, it would go through it and then decide. Overall, it is a long process, but we have the right technology and capabilities and we are very positive about it,"" Chauhan told PTI in an interview.  When asked whether the BSE would set up an entirely new exchange or acquire an existing one, he said, ""Currently, we have not decided on our strategy. Now, since the approval from Sebi has come, we will discuss it internally and with our board. Accordingly, we will take a decision.""  With regard to the BSE's IPO, Chauhan said the exchange had applied to Sebi for its IPO in January 2013.  ""As and when the approval comes, BSE will go ahead with the process of filing the DRHP and other things. So, basically, we are awaiting the in-principle approval from Sebi,"" he said.  The BSE is also very bullish on its SME platform. ""As many as 83 companies are listed already on our SME platform and 20 more are in the pipeline,"" Chauhan said.  On plans to set up an international exchange in Gujarat, he said that ""basically, the concept is that there are several international finance centres (IFSCs) across the world, such as Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, London etc"".  ""Even Indian companies have to go and raise funds from those IFSCs. This concept has been deliberated several times in India as well, but could not fructify somehow.  	""So, when this Gujarat International Finance Tec-city (GIFT) concept came up and we held discussions with them, we were told that there would be some different kind of jurisdiction. The GIFT City basically will have two areas -- one is for the domestic where BSE Brokers Forum has also taken a big space and an international one.  	""Then there is an international area, where the taxation and other regulations could be entirely different. So, the idea is to set up an international exchange there that will cater to the companies and investors from across the world,"" Chauhan said.  	Giving examples, he said that an Indonesian company can come there to raise funds from European or American or even Indian investors, while an Indian company can also go to raise funds from the global investors.  	""The idea is to compete with IFSCs like Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong and other such places. If that happens, there would be a need for a separate international exchange.  	""It would be totally independent from the existing BSE... Once rules and regulations are finalised for this IFSC, at that time BSE would begin identifying partners and other details for this exchange. The exchange would just be a small portion of a large vision that GIFT City has,"" he added.  	When asked about BSE becoming a market leader across all segments, Chauhan said, ""For me, the exchange has to figure out where it wants to focus on.  	""Over the recent years, we focussed on technology, distribution. We were earlier slow, today we are the fastest exchange in India, by ten times or more than any other exchange in the country.  	""We were not having very good distribution network and were more of a Mumbai-centric exchange. Today that has changed and we have members distributed across India. We did not have enough products and were mostly doing equity trading.  	""Today, we have all kinds of products, ranging from equity to derivatives to mutual funds to almost everything. We are able to match other exchanges on many of our products now, including in some new areas like SMEs, currency derivatives and mutual funds.  	""New technology and lower costs have helped us a lot and this can make us much more successful in other areas as well. But, that does not mean that BSE will focus on trading, our focus area going forward will be capital formation,"" he added.  	Chauhan also pitched for the foreign exchanges being allowed to invest up to 15 per cent in the Indian exchanges, on lines of similar threshold limit for domestic investors.  	Currently, the rules do not allow a foreign entity to hold more than 5 per cent.  	""... Foreign institutions say that they should be allowed to hold up to 15 per cent for parity of treatment to financial institutions irrespective of they being Indian or foreign entities.  	""If that happens there would be some strategic investments by some foreign exchanges. Today, with 5 per cent cap they are essentially financial investors,"" Chauhan added. "
BSE tweaks minimum base capital rules for brokers,"{""BSE"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bse-tweaks-minimum-base-capital-rules-for-brokers/articleshow/43808285.cms,m.economictimes.com,BSE tweaks minimum base capital rules for brokers,"NEW DELHI: The BSE has tweaked the Base Minimum Capital (BMC) norms for brokers, a move that will ensure that the deposits are maintained with the exchange and not with the clearing corporation. 

 The Base Minimum Capital (BMC) is the deposit maintained by the member of a stock exchange against which no exposure for trades is allowed. 

 It is meant for meeting contingencies in any segment of the exchange and commensurate with the risks that the broker may bring to the system. 

 ""...all deposits towards BMC will be required to be maintained with exchange,"" BSE said in a circular. 

 Currently, the BMC is blocked from the collaterals maintained with BSE's clearing corporation, ICCL, (Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL). 

 ""The Exchange (BSE), with ICCL, has initiated the process of segregating and taking over the collateral towards BMC from the collaterals maintained with ICCL,"" it added. 

 In the initial phase, the cash equivalent component of BMC collateral, to the extent possible, will be segregated from the collateral deposits maintained with ICCL and kept separately with the exchange. 

 Any shortfall in BMC collateral taken over by the exchange would be blocked from the collateral deposits of trading member maintained with ICCL. 

 The BSE said trading members would be intimated on the collaterals that have been taken over from ICCL towards BMC. 

 Brokers have been asked to ensure that at the time of renewals of fixed deposits (FDs) and bank guarantees (BGs) given as collateral to the clearing corporation, such amounts (to the extent of the shortfall) are deposited with the exchange. 

 ""Trading Members, whose shortfall in BMC is blocked from the collateral deposits maintained with ICCL, shall ensure at the time of renewing their bank guarantees, fixed deposits with BGs/ FDs with ICCL or depositing additional collaterals with ICCL, that FDs/ BGs to the extent of such shortfall is drawn in favour of the BSE and deposited with the exchange,"" the BSE said. 

 ""Such Trading Members can also voluntarily deposit FDs/ BGs with BSE towards BMC and to that extent the BMC will not be blocked at ICCL,"" it added. 

 According to norms, stock brokers or trading members should maintain a minimum capital of Rs 10 lakh in case of trading of securities are done through their own money rather than customer's without using Algo trade. 

 In 2013, capital market regulator Sebi has increased the base minimum capital (BMC) deposit for stock brokers to up to Rs 50 lakh, from a maximum of Rs 10 lakh earlier, especially the ones dealing with algorithmic trading (algo), in order to mitigate risks in the market.

  MUMBAI: Nirmal Bang is of the opinion that the initial public offering of BS Transcomm is comparatively costlier than its listed peers.
  
  “BS Transcomm operates in tower manufacturing, EPC services and O&M services segments catering to high growth sectors like telecom & power transmission and distribution. It has ventured into embedded solution and solar hybrid solutions through acquiring SAPL.
  
  We believe the integrated business model with the increased capacity and future foray into new areas like transformers, gas based insulators in collaborations with Chinese companies will add new growth avenues to the company. However limited past track record, higher working capital cycle and its ability to sustain margins in future remains a concern.
  
  On the FY10 earnings, the stock is offered at the PE of 24.1x and 23.3x (diluted equity) on upper band and lower band respectively which is comparatively costlier than its listed peers. Our back of envelope calculations of FY11 diluted earnings of Rs 20.5 discounts the issue 12.9x and 12.5x at upper and lower band respectively, which looks expensive in comparison to established players,” the note said.
  
  The company has entered the primary market with issue of Rs 76.79 lakh equity shares of face value Rs 10 each in a price band of Rs 257-266 per share. The issue closes Friday.
  
  The proceeds from the issue will be used to repay the amount borrowed for funding of Phase I capacity (86000MTPA tower manufacturing capacity and 90000 structural mill), fund Phase II ie, expansion of tower manufacturing capacity by 120000 mtpa and to part finance margin money for working capital for the project.

Vinita Bali steps down as Britannia Managing Director,"{""Britannia"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/vinita-bali-steps-down-as-britannia-managing-director/articleshow/32676357.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Vinita Bali steps down as Britannia Managing Director,"MUMBAI: Vinita Bali has stepped down as the managing director of Britannia Industries after nine years at the helm. Varun Berry, current chief operating officer of the Nusli Wadiacontrolled biscuit company, will succeed her. 

 “I chose to retire because I was clear that I wanted to do something different for the next 20 years. I am moving from one full-time role to fulltime many roles,” said Bali who was the first woman to head a major consumer goods company in India, back in 2005. 

 A company statement said Bali, 58, will retire at the end of this fiscal year to pursue a variety of roles in the corporate and development sectors. She will continue to serve on the boards of the other Wadia Group firms such as Bombay Dyeing, Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation and Go Airlines. 

 The announcement was made after market hours. Earlier in the day, Britannia share price dropped 0.47 per cent to close at Rs841.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange while the benchmark Sensex index closed 0.27 per cent lower. ET was the first to report Bali’s plans to move on, in January. Britannia’s change at the helm comes at a time when the company prepares to chart a new growth strategy, with focus on high-margin products and innovations amid stiff competition from ITC, Parle and Danone. 

 The biscuit maker had kicked off the succession plan last year, when Berry was given the charge of domestic operations earlier headed by Bali. She was made the head of Britannia’s international operations, Britannia Nutrition Foundation and tasked with the responsibility of developing new business. But she retained the designation of managing director and was responsible for the company’s revenues and profit, while reporting to Wadia. During Bali's tenure, first as CEO and then as MD, the firm’s revenues have quadrupled from Rs1,510 crore in 2005 to Rs6,185 crore in 2013. 

 But net profit in these eight years has increased marginally from Rs149 crore to Rs259 crore, as the company has had to navigate high costs and ward off competition not just from established rivals such as Parle and ITC in its core biscuit business, but also from relatively new entrants like Cadbury Kraft’s Oreo and United Biscuits’ McVities. 

 While biscuits still contribute to over three-fourths of Britannia’s sales, the company has made an aggressive push in other categories such as milk, cheese, and ready-toeat food to grow its business and improve margins. In these segments, too, however, there is stiff competition from MTR, PepsiCo and Britannia’s erstwhile partner Danone, among others. Biscuit and dairy segment put together is the largest consumer segments in the country with a market size of of almost Rs9,500 crore.

Bonds now move in tandem with stocks,"{""Bonds"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/bonds/bonds-now-move-in-tandem-with-stocks/articleshow/47607951.cms,m.economictimes.com,Bonds now move in tandem with stocks,"Investors who’ve tried to balance their holdings between stocks and bonds may be less protected from asset-price swings than they think.
 
 Here’s why: bonds globally are becoming more volatile as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. And the debt, traditionally thought of as a haven investment, has been moving in tandem with stocks during recent periods of turmoil. Take, for example, the recent bout of bond turmoil, which started at the end of April. In the period, the correlation between global bond and stock returns surged to about 30%, the most since the May 2013 taper tantrum, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co ana lyst s led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.
 
 That means that both asset classes posted losses, even though government bonds are often thought of as a hedge to stocks. So it’s been painful for those who are looking for reliable returns by diversifying their investments.
 
 Indeed, higher bond yields may signal faster economic growth, better wages and a more stable global economy after years of uncertainty. But they also will translate into losses for investors who’ve grown more vulnerable than ever to rising borrowing costs. It’s going to be a rocky road ahead, even if central banks time any changes to their stimulus programmes perfectly.

At 10:25 a.m. (0455 GMT), yield on the most traded 7.02 per cent 2016 bond was at 7.09 per cent, one basis point above Tuesday's close. There were no deals in the 10-year benchmark bond at the time. The market was closed on Wednesday for a local holiday. Volumes were a low 2.55 billion rupees ($52.4 million) on the central bank's trading platform.

""If it doesn't, yields will keep travelling up, defeating the monetary actions."" The central bank has cut its repo rate -- the short-term lending rate -- by a record 425 basis points since October. The benchmark five-year interest rate swap was at 6.37/42 per cent, little changed from Tuesday's close of 6.36/41 per cent.

The government is due to sell 120 billion rupees of bonds on Friday. Dealers said yields could rise later in the day as traders position themselves for Friday's auction. ""I don't see markets rallying till September, the supply is too much to absorb in such a short time,"" said a trader at STCI Primary Dealership. The government is due to sell 4.51 trillion rupees of bonds in 2009/10 and it plans to complete 66 per cent of this in the April-September period. The central bank has so far bought 363.97 billion rupees of bonds through open market operation buybacks since the start of April, of the 800 billion rupees of bonds it plans to buy back in the first half of the fiscal year.

  How do SKF and Bank of Baroda look on the charts? 
   
  It is too early to get into banks now. That decline of the last 2-3 days was rather intense for banks. Let's see them bottom out in a more definite manner. SKF India is a strong stock. It is pretty much at an all-time high now. It has had a good bull market. In fact, it started a month before the index, which indicates that even in bear market conditions, people were picking up the stock. So, this is an excellent recommendation. 
  
  I also like oil marketing companies. They have moved up to multi-month highs. Whether or not it is the crude oil situation but they always have been pretty good for portfolios. If you look at the kind of percentage falls they have had even in bad times, that's when crude is going up, they are not very large percentage declines. At the end of the day, you get very good returns on the oil companies, not dramatic movers but steady returns.

Typically last three or four times when the markets have been around 6350 it has been the Bank Nifty which kind of rally. So if Bank Nifty shows strength we might make a call beyond 6350 but again that is something which we will know in the next couple of days. 

 For the time being we are trading long on select banks not all of them. ICICI Bank, Bank of India and the Bank Nifty itself look pretty good to me but otherwise it is a market which is not showing signals of great trend. So even if we get a breakout it might be only for about 50 to 100 points and it might be just a shift of the range on the upside.

Mitesh Thacker: We expect markets to remain stock-specific. This may be due to Bank Nifty. 

 In case, we see Bank Nifty falling below 18,700 levels, then we might have a breakdown. 

 The Bank Nifty right now is at quoting just around 18,700 levels. The structure is getting negative and that it could possibly weigh on the Nifty movement.
 
 We might see Bank Nifty triggering corrective declines in the NSE's benchmark. In case, Bank Nifty breaks below 8,740, then the index might slip towards 8,650 and we may see another 100-point decline in the Nifty. 
 
 The market may remain stock -specific. We may see choppiness within the said range. We might fall by about 100 points, or gain by about 100 points. It may not signal a big trend on the Nifty itself. Having said this, the Bank Nifty might get into a kind of movement. On the stock-specific side, I have a 'buy today sell tomorrow' call on ACC with a stop at Rs 1,624 for the targets of Rs 1,675 levels. We also have a 'buy' on Kolte Patil with a stop at Rs 208, for the targets of Rs 232.

Kanoria, who is also vice-chairman of SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd, says India has a lot to achieve before it becomes an easier destination for doing business. In an interview with ET, Kanoria talks about the challenges facing the economy and the reforms needed to address them. Edited excerpts:
 
 
Is the economy beginning to turn around?
 
 I would say that things have started to pick up, especially in the last two months. The mobilisation of equipment and workforce at the ground level has started, specifically driven by the road sector. At the same time, real estate is still lagging behind. Apart from tier-II and tier-III towns, it is still a challenging sector, primarily in the main cities and towns.
 
 
What more should the government do to boost the sentiment?
 
 There may be challenges and it may be taking time, but there is definitely a positive drive towards finding solutions. I think that the direction is right, but there’s a lot more to be done.
 
 We are creating all kinds of infrastructure, connecting India through the road network, rail network, air network and digital network. Although we say India is a united union and is one country, to do business within states is a nightmare. I have experienced this myself in our businesses. If we look at ease of doing business, the GST is a brahmastra (powerful weapon) to kick-start the GDP.
 
 GST and the dispute resolution mechanism through the Arbitration Act [need to be pushed]. We have to see how, in the next six months, we can release 25-40% of the claims that have been stuck in arbitration for years. This will release capital.
 
 
You’ve said earlier that you want a ‘pure’ GST. What is the most important feature that needs to be imbibed in the Bill to ensure its relevance and purity?
 
 It must ensure uniformity. There needs to be a reasonable tax.
 
 Broadly, I am happy with the structure of the Bill. Where we started to see concerns was when we saw in the media that some of the producing states were looking at an additional rate of tax. To my mind, that is not fair. When you are uniting India, don’t create a difference like that.
 
 Regardless of wherever the consumption happens, it will get ironed out. I may be wrong, but, to my mind, this GST will add 1.5-2% to the GDP when it comes.
 
 
Corporate results have been weak. Exports have done badly and credit offtake has been poor. In your view, what corrective measures are required?
 
 Today, the cash flow is stuck. Bankers will start to give in when they see that the projects are viable—when they see that there is a flow of cash.
 
 When the 2G scam happened, so many mines were shut. So many small entrepreneurs and contractors suffered. We need to correct that. Good governance and right policies will help resolve these problems.
 
 
Besides the GST, what other reforms should be on the government’s agenda during the ongoing winter session of parliament?
 
 Some of these bills are critical. People have learned from the past and have done whatever bit of political interference that was required. Maybe at this juncture, they will realise that the Arbitration Act and the bankruptcy law is important because they will help in resolving many of the country’s issues.
 
 
You’ve supported the idea of segregation between barren land and fertile land. How can this be implemented?
 
 My belief is that India has no dearth of land. The government can zone the entire country into three brackets (or more)—barren land, single crop and multi crop—and then create policies for each the way you create policies for various resources, specifying what activities can be carried out in these zones. I think this will unleash a huge amount of India’s resources. This is a detail we will be working on and sending recommendations to the government about.
 
 
What do you think of the ‘intolerance’ debate?
 
 I think the issue has been blown out of proportion. Some, who know India, know that it is a very tolerant country. Others who don’t, get a little scared, so we have to create positivity. The media has a strong responsibility not to create a huge issue out of it because this gives investors negative perceptions about India.

 The company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 335.23 crore in the year-ago period, Asian Paints said in a filing to the BSE. 

 Net sales during the quarter under review stood at Rs 3,412.61 crore, while it was Rs 3,033.86 crore in the same period previous fiscal. 

 The results include unaudited consolidated financials of Sleep International Pvt Ltd, in which the company acquired 51 per cent stake on August 8, 2013 and hence, are not comparable with the corresponding period, it said. 

 Commenting on the performance, Asian Paints Managing Director and CEO KBS Anand said: ""The decorative business in India did well considering the challenging and uncertain macro environment. Raw material prices were marginally higher in the third quarter."" 

 Cost of materials consumer stood at Rs 1,845.21 crore during the quarter as against Rs 1,572.30 crore in the year-ago period, the company said. 

 ""Industrial paints segment continued to be impacted by sluggish manufacturing environment in the economy, with no major capex activity. Automotive coatings growth was affected due to the subdued demand in automotive sector,"" he added 

 On the international business, Anand said Middle East and Asia have done well even though some countries continued to be affected by political events and macro economic uncertainty. 

 During the quarter, the company's wholly-owned arm Asian Paints Ltd, Mauritius (APIL) acquired an additional stake of 12.8 per cent in its subsidiary Berger International Ltd, Singapore (BIL) through a voluntary unconditional cash offer and open market purchases. As on December 31, 2013 the shareholding of APIL in BI Lwas 96.5 per cent, it added.

Sumantran's resignation as executive vice chairman and from his position in Ashok Leyland will be effective from 31 March 2014 .
 
 The announcement was made post the board meeting of Ashok Leyland on Thursday. Among many responsibilities, Sumantran had overseen the LCV business of Ashok Leyland with Nissan, setting up of construction equipment business with John Deere and expanding the Defence business for Ashok Leyland. He also helped Hinduja Group to diversify into various engineering business including products for the Defence sector.
 
 Ashok Leyland in a statement said Sumantran will continue to be an advisor to Hinduja Group and mentioned that Sumantran is pursuing interests in """"academia, research and consulting.""""
 
 Industry grapevine suggests that Sumantran's stepping down coincides with Tata Motors flagging off an hunt for a CEO, to replace the vacant position created by the sudden demise of Karl Slym, the Tata Motors CEO.
 
 Sumantran, an automobile industry veteran has vast experience of working in different auto majors like General Motors, SAAB Automotive and his term at Tata Motors in the past.
 
 Sumantran was in charge of Tata Motors passenger car business and was head of Engineering & Research Centre at Tata Motors from 2001 to 2005. Industry grapevine suggests that he is one of the key contenders to take over the reins at Tata Motors.
 
 In his mid-50s, Sumantran has vast experience of working in both passenger cars and commercial vehicles segment and the fact that he worked in Tata Motors in the past makes him an ideal candidate to lead the country's largest automobile company in terms of revenues.
 
 ET could not independently confirm this. And a message sent to Dr V Sumantran did not elicit any response.
 
 But people close to the company told ET, over the last few days the name of Dr V Sumantran has been doing the rounds.
 
 However, a section also believe that Mr Sumantran who's known as a strategist may not return to Tata Motors as a CEO, because the company needs a person capable for flawlessly executing the strategies that are already been put in place during Slym's time.

  The group said these brokers were sending out mass emails and SMSs and were also making large-scale voice calls with baseless and sensational charges against its firms.
  
  Stocks of various companies belonging to the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group have fallen sharply in the past few weeks and the group has blamed corporate rivals, a cartel of stock market manipulators and 'rumour mongering' for this heavy sell-off.
  
  While the group has already sought an investigation by SEBI, the stock exchanges and investigation agencies into the matter, it said in a fresh statement today that it has ""identified stockbrokers sending mass e-mails/SMS/voice calls with baseless sensational charges against ADA Group.""
  
  While the group did not name the brokers in its statement, the names and other details about their suspicious activities have been submitted to SEBI.
  
  ""These brokers (are) guilty of blatant violation of SEBI (FUTP) Regulations,"" the group said. These regulations relate to Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (FUTP) relating to the securities market.

  It also sought a ""full-fledged SEBI investigation and punitive interim orders against guilty brokers"".
  
  Stocks of ADA group firms plummeted further today after regaining some of the ground lost over the past few weeks yesterday.

  Hit hard by the steep decline in its group stocks, the group had yesterday blamed 'corporate rivals' and a cartel of market manipulators for causing panic among investors.
  
  Seeking to assuage the concerns of its over 11 million investors, the group also said it was a victim of an illegal bear cartel that destroyed over Rs 3,00,000 crore in market value for the infrastructure sector in the past few weeks.
  
  The comments came a day after the group stocks fell by up to 19 per cent, causing a market value loss of over Rs 11,000 crore in a single day on February 9. The group stocks bounced back yesterday, but could only regain a small part of the value lost over the past few weeks.

  NEW DELHI: Engeenering and construction services firm A2Z Maintenance & Engineering Services plans to raise around Rs 350 crore through a public issue of shares to fund its expansion plans, a top company official said.
  
  The company will sell around 10% of the total equity through the public issue. A2Z Maintenance & Engineering Services managing director Amit Mittal said, “We expect to file draft red herring prospectus by month-end.”
  
  Companies issuing shares to the public are required to get their issue approved by the capital markets regulator and submit their prospectus giving details of the company besides the purpose of the fund-raising exercise.
  
  Started in 2002 as a facility management services company, A2Z has evolved into an engineering, procurement and construction services provider to the power transmission and distribution companies. For the year ended March 2010, the company had consolidated sales of Rs 1,200 crore and expects to grow 25% this year.
  
  The company has diversified into waste management, and plans to aggressively scale up this business after the public issue. The proceeds of the public issue will be used to fund the company’s several projects across renewable energy and waste management.
  
  At present, the founder Mr Mittal and his family, holds around 55% stake in the Gurgaon-based company, which will fall to around 50% post the issue. The remaining equity is held by three investors including Rakesh Jhunjhunwala who bought a 22% stake in 2006. Private equity funds Beacon India and India Equity Partners picked up minority stake in the company between 2007 and 2009.
  
  One of the private equity investors is expected to exit during the initial public offer, a person familiar with the matter said. Merrill Lynch, Enam Securities and IDFC are the merchant bankers for the issue, the same person said requesting anonymity.

 Markets started the week on a positive note with the Nifty making a fresh all-time high of 8180. But, from that point, the markets saw some profit-booking amid caution ahead of key economic data (foreign trade, IIP & CPI). 

 Also, the global markets turned shaky amid prospects of higher interest rates in the US and concerns over the Euro Zone and China. 

 The rupee weakened for two consecutive sessions (Tuesday and Wednesday) amid renewed strength in the US dollar. Derivatives data suggests long unwinding in the Nifty futures and the Bank Nifty futures, which is indicated 

 However, market breadth, as defined by advance-decline ratio, continues to be favourable, which implies that stockspecific activity remains strong. There is a lot of churning from large cap stocks to midcaps in the past week.

  Are you absolutely convinced that 5200-5300 is the big base for the Nifty for this year?
   
  
  Vibhav Kapoor: As things stand today, yes, I would think so, anywhere between 5150 to 5300 should be the big base because at that level, two things happen, one is valuation start to look pretty attractive even if you just factor in a 13-15% growth in profits for FY12. Secondly the market then is really underperforming the rest of the world in a very big way. If you look at the performance relative to the S&P as an example, we are ordinarily underperforming year to date by about 16-17% and let’s assume that the S&P stays at the same level and we go down by another 10%, you would be underperforming by about 25%, which is a huge underperformance. A similar situation is there with a lot of other emerging markets like Korea for example. 
  
  Below 5152, which has been a major support for the past year, year-and-a-half, if the market were to go below that, it would really signify that you are getting into a very long-term bear market, which can only happen if the economy goes into a recession and company’s profitability growth was down to below 7-8%. It does not seem to be the situation right now. Thirdly at some point of time once QE2 ends in the US, you would have a cooling down of commodity and oil prices to some extent and that would be helpful for inflation in India as well as for company’s margins and, therefore, going forward 5150-5300 at the moment is certainly a level, which one would buy aggressively and look to be a long-term one.

Whenever the Nifty touches this level, it tends to have a bounce back so these are two levels people can keep in mind. Today in the morning Bank Nifty went below levels of 14,100 so that gave you a nice buying opportunity.

 This marks an end of the 10 year long copy-art partnership he had with co-NCD Malvika Mehra which started at Ogilvy Mumbai.Under their combined creative leadership, Grey had bagged a good number of metals at both Abbys and Cannes Lions last year, for Killer Jeans' Green Fold campaign. 

 Commenting on his exit, Malvika Mehra, NCD at Grey said, ""I had hoped for this partnership to continue forever but we both want different things from our careers right now. He wants to explore something new and I'm not yet done with what I wanted to accomplish at Grey."" 

 Mehra will continue in her role as the sole NCD of the agency henceforth.

Ansuman Das takes over as full-time CMD of NALCO,"{""NALCO"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/ansuman-das-takes-over-as-full-time-cmd-of-nalco/articleshow/21166186.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ansuman Das takes over as full-time CMD of NALCO,"KOLKATA: Ansuman Das has been appointed as full-time CMD of National Aluminium Company Limited (Nalco) with effect from Friday, July 19, 2013. Mr Das has been acting as chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of the country's largest state owned aluminium major since August 2012. He will be the company's first regular CMD in more than two years. 

 Earlier, ET had reported that the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) had recommended Ansuman Das as its top choice for the job of chairman and managing director of Nalco, paving the way for the appointment of a regular chief in more than two years. 

 Mr Das who graduated in Mechanical Engineering from REC, Rourkela, (now a National Institute of Technology) in 1976, and did his MBA from University of Hull, UK. 

 He started his career with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and joined Nalco in 1982 in the company's formative years as senior engineer in project and technical services, subsequently rising to the post of general manager (marketing). He was instrumental in formation of various marketing policies and strategies both for domestic and overseas sales and launched almost all the value added products of Nalco. He took over as director (commercial) of Nalco in October 2009.
 
 Mr Das was also holding the additional charge of director (human resources) for a brief period in 2012, and now holds additional charge of director (finance). 

 Mr Das' appointment ends months of uncertainty about Nalco's top leadership. In the last few years, Nalco's top post has been riddled with controversies, with successive CMDs falling prey to corruption charges. In February 2011, A K Srivastava, then CMD, was charge-sheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and eventually removed form the top job. He was succeeded by B L Bagra, director (finance) as acting CMD. In August 2012, Bagra faced allegations of corruption and subsequently stepped down.
 
 However, he was later reinstated as director finance. Earlier, C Venkatramana erstwhile CMD, had to step aside and his position was taken by C R Pradhan who retired as acting CMD.

Arbitrageurs building positions in natural gas counter on MCX,"{""MCX"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/arbitrageurs-building-positions-in-natural-gas-counter-on-mcx/articleshow/30534285.cms,m.economictimes.com,Arbitrageurs building positions in natural gas counter on MCX,"MUMBAI: The natural gas counter on the MCX has been abuzz with activity of late because persons called arbitrageurs, who exploit price differences in a product that’s traded on different markets, are building positions in the counter, along with local speculators, claim brokers.
 
 While, in theory, an arbitrage trade is risk-free, in practice, factors like currency fluctuations could crimp profitability arising out of such trades.
 
 The MCX natural gas contract mimics the price movement of the US-based Nymex gas contract, but currency fluctuations and certain other factors have widened the disparity between the two contracts, which arbitrageurs are quick to exploit. This actually narrows the deviance in the two contracts.
 
 “Normally, there’s a spread of Rs 1 or so between MCX and Nymex contracts, but that’s increased of late,” said a broker on condition of anonymity as domestic commodity market participants cannot trade on foreign terminals. MCX cannot be blamed for such arb trades, added brokers, as they are beyond its jurisdiction. The volatility on MCX gas is reflecting that on Nymex.
 
 The price on MCX fell 14 per cent from a closing high of Rs 333.6 per mmBtu on February 4 to Rs 287.6 on February 10, before recovering to Rs 324.4 or 13 per cent on February 14. This is broadly in line with volatility on Nymex, but on all three days, the contracts on either bourse have traded at a premium or discount to each other.
 
 The rupee over the same period has fluctuated by 63 paise between high and low, which, among other factors, has resulted in intraday price skews between the two contracts. Arbitrageurs have exploited this skew, buying the contract which is cheaper and selling that which is costlier.
 
 For instance, on Feb 4, the MCX active natural gas contract closed at Rs 333.6, a discount of Rs 2.5 to the Nymex contract. While this may not be too big, it translates intoRs 25,000 at the contract level as the Nymex contract size is 10,000 mmBtu.
 
 
 To arbitrage, a person will have to but eight lots of MCX gas, which at 1250 mmBtu is a smaller contract. On February 10, MCX gas quoted at Rs 287.6, a premium ofRs 1.74 to Nymex and on Feb 14 at Rs 324.4, aRs 1.5 premium to the overseas contract. “These days sophisticated automated, or algo software on terminals spot price differences across markets in fractions of seconds and the gap is closed very soon,” said another broker.
 
 “Normally, there’s expected profit in such trades, but currency can play spoilsport, so there is risk to Indian players who enter such trades.” The Nymex contract has become very volatile because bitter cold in various parts of the US and has raised concerns that gas inventories could be depleted.
 
 Though commodity market regulator FMC disallows trading on foreign terminals, market sources claim that a few traders work around such restrictions. However, forecasts of milder weather, going forward, could dampen the volatility on the higher side.
 
 Also, the regulator could raise margins in light of heightened volatility, reducing gains from such trades.

 ""Therefore no further purchases of shares of this company would be allowed through stock exchanges in India on behalf of FIIs,"" the RBI said. 

 The RBI monitors the ceilings on investments by FIIs, non-resident Indians and persons of Indian origin on a daily basis. 

 The central bank has set a cut-off level that is two percentage points lower than the actual ceiling. After the net equity investment in a company reaches the cut-off level, additional share purchases require the RBI's approval.

Banking stocks to see lot of traction: Mitesh Thacker,"{""Banking stocks"": ""positive""}",https://m.economictimes.com/opinion/interviews/see-some-upside-in-market-on-monday-mitesh-thacker/articleshow/27025133.cms,m.economictimes.com,See some upside in market on Monday: Mitesh Thacker,"In an interview with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on the market and some stocks. Excerpts:


	ET Now: It has been an interesting week of trade. Sunday will probably have an impact on what the markets do on Monday morning, but what do the charts suggest, is there more upside in store?


	Mitesh Thacker: I would say the chances of some upside are definitely there. We have seen time and again the market rallies fail to get past the levels of 6300, 6335. This band of 35-40 points is an extremely important area wherein the market has historically registered multiple peaks. But this structure is quite positive also. What is encouraging is the fact that we saw rise as we got into the event in the last two days. So typically that suggests that directional trending move should begin, but I think once we start getting past 6340, 6350 levels, then we will see at least another 100-150-point upside happen on an immediate basis in the Nifty and that could be a good trading point if we get a gap up on Monday.


	ET Now: Besides Power Grid, the likes of Adani Power, GVK Power or for that matter Tata Power, where there is still opportunity to make money?


	Mitesh Thacker: See this entire space looks attractive to me even from the current levels. So Adani Power has met the first targets of 40, but I do not think there has been any kind of slowdown of the signal or momentum loss in the charts. So my belief is that maybe 43, 44 is what we are looking at. Tata Power can possibly go up to about the levels of 95. It has also given a breakout above its 200-day average today and 94, 95 is the first area and possibly even 100 can be tested over here. So there is still some more trading momentum left in these stocks. Both the flagship stocks can do well. The one which has not really participated is R-Power, but if it starts trading above 78, 78.5, then you might see a momentum breakout happening there as well.


	ET Now: Would you play any of them – Renuka, maybe a Bajaj Hindustan or Balrampur Chini?


	Mitesh Thacker: The chart was positive. I am just waiting for some kind of breakout to happen on the upside to confirm further movement or trended movement to take place. Renuka needs to get past 22.5 and then we can look for another 8-9% upside to 24.5, 25 in the next supply point. Bajaj Hindustan has declined a lot, extremely oversold on medium term charts, but needs to start getting past 15.75 to suggest that it is starting a short to medium term uptrend and then we look at targets of around 18.5 or so. So I am positive on the sector, but we will trade as the price gives confirmation of the trend on the upside.


	ET Now: Coming on these stocks – Strides and Jubilant Life – how much more downside do you see?


	Mitesh Thacker: Jubilant Life in fact has gone through a good uptrend from the levels of sub-100 to about 140 and it has corrected from those levels 140, 140 plus to about 120. My belief is that in case it continues to decline below 115, then we might look at 107, 105 being tested on the downside and I think that should be it. I do not have a view on Strides.
	 

	 

	ET Now: Is there is anything else that you saw because there was quite a bit of traction in Zee Entertainment in Friday’s session, Biocon is trading at new highs, do you like any of these two stocks?


	Mitesh Thacker: I like in fact both of them. Biocon clearly has been on the recommendation list for a number of weeks now. It comes as a buy call only, stays in the strong uptrend, 425 is the area where this stock can head. Zee is in fact just getting into newer swing highs in the sense that 280, 285 was the recent high which is the high in month of November and the long-term charts remain pretty strong over here. So again that is a stock which can do about the levels of 320. The other one which I can add over here is Divi's Lab. After the numbers it has kind of been sideways and it consolidates for about two-and-a-half, three weeks now so any time the stock starts getting past 1175, 1180, it might be a very interesting stock to look at.


	ET Now: Coming on some of these banking names, Bank Nifty showed a lot of open interest, like a couple of banking names particularly UCO or an OBC which had massive OI build up in Friday’s session too. Can the run-up that we saw continue well into the next week?


	Mitesh Thacker: I believe so. What happened on Thursday was that after the big gap up we saw Nifty kind of come down from the levels of 6300 and close about three quarters of a percent of the day’s high. While the Bank Nifty clearly closed very close to the day’s high, also is the fact that Bank Nifty closed higher on Friday, that is very, very higher compared to the Thursday high on Friday which the Nifty did not do so that is a very positive setup. Also, along with the kind of movement in the Bank Nifty, a lot of these banking stocks generated strong buy signals. So all of these PSU banks, particularly PNB, State Bank of India, Canara Bank and the smaller ones like UCO Bank and Allahabad Bank have given buy signals and I would be positive on them unless and until the Monday event turns out to be something drastically negative.


	ET Now: What is it that you are recommending for trade Monday morning?


	Mitesh Thacker: I have three buy calls again not from a very short-term point of view, but stocks which appear to have triggered a medium-term uptrend – Adani Ports can be bought with a stop below 157, for let us say about two-week targets of around 180 plus; IDFC is a buy with a stop at 107, for targets of 120-125 and being a low beta stock again it can take about 8-10 trading sessions to reach there. I have got a buy on ICICI Bank. This is slightly short-term in the sense that 1200 is an important area for the stock. So buy with that target and keep a stop below 1122.

BPCL hires four banks for US dollar bond offering,"{""BPCL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bpcl-hires-four-banks-for-us-dollar-bond-offering/articleshow/46956531.cms,m.economictimes.com,BPCL hires four banks for US dollar bond offering,"SINGAPORE: State-owned refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp has mandated four banks for a potential US dollar bond offering. 

 Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered will lead the offering, the proceeds from which will be used for capital expenditure needs. 

 The fundraising will be off the refiner's US$2bn MTN programme, which has scored a BBB- rating by Fitch. 

 BPCL plans to spend Rs150bn-200bn (US$2.4bn-3.2bn) on its Kochi refinery in the next two years, as reported earlier. 

 The company is increasing the capacity of the refinery to 15.5 million tonnes per annum from the current 9.5mtpa at a cost of around Rs165bn. 

 Meanwhile, the refiner has scrapped its US$500m loan refinancing for which it has received only one bid from a six bank group, according to sources aware of the situation. 

 Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, DBS Bank, HSBC, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Westpac Banking Corp are the banks forming the sole group that has bid for the BPCL deal. 

 BPCL scrapped the loan offering as the pricing offered by the bank group did not meet the company's expectations. 

 In mid-March, the borrower had sent a request for proposals for the loan, which would have an average life of around four years. Banks were asked to respond by April 1. 

 Sources said BPCL had initially eyed pricing of around 120bp all-in but received offers around 150bp from the bank group. 

 In January, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ won the mandate on BPCL's US$100m three-year refinancing at an all-in of 100bp and closed it as a bilateral later. 

 The Indian Government owns 54.9% of BPCL, the country's third largest refiner.

In a letter to National Stock Exchange, an apex body of trading members of all national exchanges in the country has contended that they are ""unable to comprehend high differential in transaction charges"" levied in the option segment for F&O (Futures and Options) and currency markets.  	While transaction charges vary from one exchange to the other, all of them have differential charges for different market segments.  	Besides, the charges are also typically linked to the trading volumes and the rates are lower for larger volume of trades.  	The letter, written by Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) earlier this month, follows a representation made by an ANMI delegation before the NSE.  	ANMI is a pan-India body comprising trading members across the country of NSE, BSE and other exchanges having national presence. NSE is the largest exchange in the country in terms of trade volumes.  	The industry body further said that a reduction in transaction charges ""will only encourage members to increase the volume of business that is being placed through NSE.""  	""Amongst several points made in the representation we have highlighted that the transaction charges levied by NSE on Options segment (F&O and Currency) is exorbitant.  	""You are aware that transaction charges on purchase and sell of Options is 0.05 per cent of the premium, while the transaction charges in the equity delivery segment and in the equity intraday is only 0.0031 per cent,"" ANMI wrote.  	Pointing out that the market regulator Sebi's turnover charges were same across segments, ANMI further said that stamp duty charges on equity intraday segment and stamp duty levied on options is also uniform.  	""Members are therefore unable to comprehend high differential in transaction charges levied by you in option segment (F&O and Currency).  	""We would like to further draw your attention that apart from statutory dues mentioned above there is incidence of STT (Securities Transaction Tax) and service taxes, which increases the cost of transactions.  	""You are aware that the volumes in options segment (F&O and Currency) have grown considerably whereas the high cost of transaction has only translated in reduced brokerage levels for the industry.  	""In view of these circumstances we request NSE to review the transaction charges and to revise the same downwards,"" it added. "

 A proposal in this regard has been approved by the board of BSE, which is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of number of listed companies and holds top positions on various other counts. 

 Sources said the BSE board has cleared the proposal and further modalities would be put in place soon. 

 Incidentally, BSE had also put in an initial bid, estimated at about Rs 500 crore, recently for purchase of 15 per cent stake in the country's largest commodity exchange Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). 

 Kotak Group finally acquired the MCX stake for Rs 459 crore, while BSE and another bidder Reliance Capital did not participate in final bidding due to adverse comments made by the exchange's auditors in the wake of NSEL scam. 

 The commodity trading business in India records total turnover of over Rs 100 lakh crore annually, although only two players dominate the market. 

 There used to over 20 commodity exchanges in India, including six of national-level, but the total number has now come down to ten. This includes four national-level bourses. Volumes have also come down in recent quarters, due to imposition of commodities transaction tax, among others. 

 BSE, which was set up in 1875 and is the oldest exchange in Asia, is currently one of the two major bourses in India. There are more than 5,500 companies listed on BSE, which is highest for any exchange in the world, with a total market capitalisation of over Rs 93 lakh crore. 

 After beginning with a humble background of functioning under banyan trees over 125 years ago, BSE has now emerged as one of the world's most technologically advanced exchanges and is targeting ten-times faster trades on its platform within three years. 

 Already, the exchange has made significant changes in its technology and has attained a response time of 200 micro- seconds for trades executed on its platform, BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan recently told PTI in an interview. 

 The aim is to bring the response time further down to 20 micro-seconds within the next three years, he had said. 

 Presently, BSE handles 500,000 orders in a second at the response time of 200 micro seconds. There are more than 2.6 crore investors registered on BSE. 

 BSE's 30-share index Sensex is known as the benchmark index of the Indian stock market. 

 During the financial year 2013-14, the exchange recorded a total income of Rs 529.71 crore, while profits rose by 25 per cent to Rs Rs 135.19 crore.

Nitin Raheja: What you are seeing in Ceat is actually what you have seen in a lot of stocks across the sector where you had huge under valuation which was on the extreme. When you saw the large base of the turnover and when you start seeing margin starting to play an upside, even a 1% change in margin on the increment makes a big impact. So, in our view it is fairly priced at this moment at least in the shorter term. Now people will look at actual incremental volume numbers or volume driven growth to drive the stock further.

Excerpts:
 
 
ET Now: The track for banks clearly is bad but along with PSU banks this week NBFC and quality private banks also have got whacked, is it a good time not to buy into quality NBFC stocks and revisit private banks?
 
 
Prateek Agarwal: I will want to segment a bit, we would want to look at pricing power. Pricing power in certain NBFCs which may be let say focused on sectors like CV financing may be low at this point in time because the space itself is very damaged. There is hardly any growth that we are looking at in the CV space. So if a NBFC is present in a space where the consumer demand is strong I guess they would have better pricing power and it may make sense to back those kind of models rather than single product models where the product itself is going through a lean patch.
 
 Yes, NBFCs some of them have really done well in terms of scaling up, tighter liquidity makes the NBFC model a bit more susceptible versus banks but I guess if you have pricing power increase in cost may be passed on so we do have some exposure to NBFCs and we believe we will keep looking in that space. Also, some of the NBFCs offer a good way of playing the insurance theme, if you look at the valuations of best of NBFCs with insurance as the core value that they offer the valuations are actually cheaper than some of the best run banks. While if you look at the business per se it would stand to reason if I say insurance is a superior business versus banking. So there is some correction in valuations which need to take place.

Cosmo Films to raise Rs 100 crore through QIP,"{""Cosmo Films"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/cosmo-films-to-raise-rs-100-crore-through-qip/articleshow/50042020.cms,m.economictimes.com,Cosmo Films to raise Rs 100 crore through QIP,"NEW DELHI: Cosmo Films, a manufacturer of bi-axially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), today said it will raise up to Rs 100 crore through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) route.  	""The Board of Directors of the company have approved... raising of funds up to Rs 100 crore (including premium) through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) of equity shares and/or any other eligible securities,"" Cosmo Films said in a BSE filing.  	Last month, the company said it plans to invest Rs 220 crore to expand the capacity at its Gujarat and Maharashtra facilities.  	""We are installing a new BOPP line with 60,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) capacity by early 2017 at our Vadodara facility in Gujarat. The cost for the said expansion is estimated at Rs 200 crore.  	""We are also adding cast polypropylene line at our Maharashtra facility at a cost of Rs 20 crore,"" Cosmo Films CEO Pankaj Poddar had told PTI.  	The project will be funded through debt and internal accruals. The line has already been ordered and will increase the company's annual BOPP production capacity to 2,00,000 tpa, Poddar had said.  	The demand for BOPP film is growing at 12-15 per cent annually. The company is anticipating a strong demand for BOPP films in the coming years, especially from the FMCG sector, which prompts it to expand its BOPP production capacity.  	The output for the production unit intends to be used for both domestic and export markets.  	BOPP films, which offer high strength, elasticity, high barrier properties, resistance to various corrosive environments and inertness, are used in making flexible food packaging, adhesive tapes, labels and lamination applications.  	The company is the largest exporter of BOPP films from India and also the largest producer of thermal laminating films in the world with plant-cum-distribution centres in the US, Korea, Japan and global channel partners in more than 50 countries.

Create framework to fight cyber attacks on markets: Sebi,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/create-framework-to-fight-cyber-attacks-on-markets-sebi/articleshow/46848594.cms,m.economictimes.com,Create framework to fight cyber attacks on markets: Sebi," 	MUMBAI: To protect the securities market from cyber-crimes, India’s capital market regulator on Wednesday said there is a need to put in place a framework of regulation.  	“There is a need to create a framework for a future plan of action on securities market resilience. Across the world, securities markets are vulnerable as adoption of technology has not only been fast, but dependence on technology is also 100%.The worry is that such attacks are getting sophisticated,” the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman UK Sinha said at an event here. He was addressing the Cyber Security Resilience Conference, organised by Sebi and the BSE.  	Sinha said as these cyber attackers use the latest technology they could be state-sponsored. “These are done by people who have the best of technology and resources, and some of them are state-sponsored. It has a huge impact on larger systems, society and nations,” he said. These cyber attacks are not just restricted to the financial services sector but are happening across all sectors of the econom, he added “The risk is the effect it has on business and, therefore, one can only guess in terms of protecting the network. Globally, the challenge for all the markets and regulators is to assess the gap and prepare to maintain the sanctity of the markets. Openness and co-operation will help in a big way,” Sinha said.  	The Sebi chief also added that although adoption of the latest technologies is advantageous, it also has its own challenges and hence there is a need to create more awareness, conduct frequent audits of the system and mock-drills.  	The global forum for securities market regulators, International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), has also been working on it. “IOSCO has been working on it for the last two years, on how countries and regulators across the world should coordinate and prepare for it,” Sinha said.  	Maharashtra Governor Vidyasagar Rao, who was also present at the event, said: “I am told manipulation of stock exchanges is the new modus operandi used by terrorist groups to raise funds for their operations. We need ecosystems to protect the economic sovereignty of the nation. We also need to evolve a foolproof cyber-security mechanism to protect the economic integrity of corporates, multinational corporations, and business organisations.”  	He added that the number of cyber crimes in the country could touch three lakhs this year.

Dalit Entrepreneurs celebrate the launch of Dicci's Mumbai chapter,"{""Dicci"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/dalit-entrepreneurs-celebrate-the-launch-of-diccis-mumbai-chapter/articleshow/8643132.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Dalit Entrepreneurs celebrate the launch of Dicci's Mumbai chapter,"
  MUMBAI: Dalit capitalism, on the fringes of socioeconomic debate for a while, finally ordained its high priests, bared the material possessions and aplomb of new Dalit wealth, and basked in a serenade by officials of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at a ‘coming out’ party of sorts in Mumbai on Saturday. 
  
  Some of the 1,000-odd signatories to this new take on capitalism — members of the fledgling Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (Dicci) — met at The Rooftop Rendezvous of Hotel Taj Mahal in south Mumbai, the evening hiring charges of which exceed Rs 5 lakh. 
  
  The launch of Dicci’s Mumbai chapter, in a way, heralds the willingness of this small set to stand up and be counted among wealth creators of a new and reforming India. The deliberate choice of venue, the BMWs and limousines in the parking lot, and display of the usual trappings of wealth was to signal their ‘arrival’, as it were, in India’s financial capital, the city of opportunities, and home to some of the most distinguished industrial groups of the country. 
  
  “We are now in the league of jobgivers,” says Milind Kamble, chairman, Dicci. The congregation even found a poster boy in Rajesh Saraiya, CEO of the UK-based SteelMont, which has a turnover of about $400 million. Saraiya, a penurious youth from rural Uttar Pradesh, began his career in Ukraine as a Russian language interpreter to billionaire steel tycoon Laxmi Niwas Mittal. He eventually got into steel trading and is now one of the biggest buyers of steel from SAIL, the Indian public sector giant. Would he get into steel manufacturing, emulating his first employer? 
  
  “I have just started my India operations,” he says. “It’s early days; but nothing can be ruled out.” CAPITAL, NOT CASTE The confidence and resolve of the bunch of Dalit entrepreneurs at the meet was infectious as they, dressed in dapper business suits and with glasses of single malt whisky, recalled their early days. The caste prejudices they confronted as struggling Dalits were, however, cast aside and not broached. “Look ahead, the future belongs to us,” says Ashok Khade, managing director of the Rs 550-crore DAS Offshore Engineering. Khade employs 4,500 people, of which 152 are BTech engineers.
  
  However, Khade’s business card still bears the wounds of prejudices, past and, perhaps, the present. It simply says ‘K Ashok’, concealing his surname, a caste giveaway. Also present was Kalpana Saroj, chairperson of Kamani Tubes, who Chandra Bhan Prasad, Dalit activist and a mentor of Dicci, on the occasion, dubbed as the ‘Oprah Winfrey of Dalits’. Saroj recently took over Kamani and is nursing the sick company back to health.
  
   “We will turn the corner soon to healthy profits,” she says. While the Dalit entrepreneurs bonded and celebrated the creation of a collective of their own, they agreed on the fact that their journey had been a long struggle and that one of the most serious impediments had been access to capital, which many face even today. Arun Khobragade, former senior vice-president of ABN Amro Bank and now promoter of a successful frozen foods company, is toying with the idea of raising a venture capital fund. Raising capital is indeed a challenge for all entrepreneurs, Dalits included. 
  
  Therefore, Dicci members were all ears when Lakshman Gugulothu, MD and CEO of BSE’s new SME Exchange, slated to launch operations soon, dwelt on the intricacies of public offerings and market making. Small and medium enterprises with a post-issue paid-up capital of up to Rs 25 crore are eligible to list on the new exchange. Issues around access to capital and the need to grow throw up numerous questions in the Dalit context. 
  
  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
  
  Can this new lot, especially the newer, younger lot, progress and also foster a new generation of Dalit entrepreneurs without proactive support from the government and the rest of Indian industry? They drew comfort in the presence of Jamshed Irani, director of Tata Sons and a keen proponent of affirmative action in the private sector. 
  
  However, another Tata luminary, B Muthuraman, was absent. Muthuraman, the vice-chairman of Tata Steel and the newly-elected president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, had promised to launch the Mumbai chapter. Muthuraman has been voicing his support for affirmative action and a key initiative: supplier diversity. Supplier diversity is a concept with roots in the American affirmative action framework, where large companies seek out, support — in terms of management and technology inputs — and buy goods and services from underprivileged and minority suppliers. In the US, supplier diversity has helped scores of black and minority suppliers enter critical supply chains of large multinationals. 
  
  The Billion Dollar Roundtable — a club of over 15 companies, including Ford, Honda, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Proctor & Gamble and Walmart — spend at least $1 billion annually with minority and women-owned suppliers. Member companies of another platform, the National Minority Suppliers Development Council, sourced supplies worth $101 billion from minority businesses in 2009. Will Indian industrialists and industry promote a similar support structure for Dalit and other minority entrepreneurs? 
  
  There are no positive signs whatsoever, though the Tatas, especially Tata Motors, has made some small beginnings towards this. The Indian government is beginning to get into the act by tweaking a quota for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe (SC/ST) suppliers in governmental tender purchases. Over a decade ago, the Digvijay Singh government in Madhya Pradesh had launched a SC supplier support initiative. 
  
  The Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh made noises on this issue by mandating preferential purchases to publicprivate partnerships, but nothing really materialised. EXCLUSIVE OR INCLUSIVE? Although we have a handful of Dalit entrepreneurs, who are celebrating the discovery of their own, Dalit entrepreneurship will need society’s support to gain critical mass. Will it be forthcoming? No, says Anand Teltumbde, civil rights activist, who quit as CEO of Petronet India recently. Teltumbde, grandson of Babasaheb Ambedkar, is aghast at the manner in which a small band of Dalit capitalists are being cited and portrayed as a marker of progress for the entire Dalit community.
  
  “It’s nothing short of a cruel joke,” he says, coming as it is in the face of continued atrocities on Dalits across the country and the precarious state of much of the Dalit rural populace. He even questions the strategy of Dalit entrepreneurs to assemble as Dicci. “They would have progressed better if they joined a mainstream chambers of commerce instead of appending a caste idiom to the outfit. It will raise the antennas of people against them and restrict business opportunities; it defies business logic,” he explains. “It’s ghettoising entrepreneurship.” Teltumbde doesn’t expect the new Dalit elite to do much for the community, as has always been with Dalit elite over the past decades. However, the new bunch of entrepreneurs refute this contention. 
  
  Malkiat Chand of the Rs 70-crore Janagal Exports of Ludhiana recalls how he had, time and again, attempted to create new Dalit vendors for his company, with varying degrees of success. The Makwanas of a Rs 300-crore industrial group in Gujarat claim that Dalits make up over half their labour force. “We don’t believe in the existing political and social structures to emancipate Dalits. 
  
  What we, as entrepreneurs, can do is to create and foster an ecosystem of Dalit vendors, as a road to progress,” says Arun Khobragade of RAS Frozen Foods. While Teltumbde dubs the newfound profile being given to Dalit enterprise as the handiwork of neo-liberal forces to co-opt the new breed of Dalits, even at the launch ceremony there were subtle rumblings on the very form of capitalism that Dalits ought to pursue. 
  
  Would their brand of capitalism be based on the neo-liberal variety of greed and profit-maximisation, or would it veer towards something with an ethical and moral underpinning? Asmall section of the attendees, especially Kuldeep Ramteke, an IIT alumnus, talked about the ‘Buddhist economy’ and the concept of ‘gross national happiness’, against the fascination for GDP growth. A sizeable section of Dalits in Maharashtra, the Mahars, to which Babasaheb Ambedkar once belonged, are Buddhists. The new Dalit elite do have a lot to chew upon.

Did Federal Reserve's Janet Yellen just enter currency wars?,"{""Federal Reserve"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/forex/did-federal-reserves-janet-yellen-just-enter-currency-wars/articleshow/46305983.cms,m.economictimes.com,Did Federal Reserve's Janet Yellen just enter currency wars?,"NEW YORK: The minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting last month have foreign-exchange traders wondering whether Janet Yellen has joined the currency wars. Policy makers pointed to the dollar's rising value as ""a persistent source of restraint"" on exports in a surprisingly dovish set of minutes published Wednesday. The greenback fell against a broad group of its peers.
 
 Central bankers from Europe to Australia have engaged this year in bouts of rate-cutting one-upmanship, leaving the US, and possibly Britain, as the only developed nations seen as likely to raise borrowing costs in 2015. The dollar climbed to its strongest in more than a decade as a result, prompting billionaire Warren Buffett and Goldman Sachs Group Inc president Gary Cohn to question whether the Fed can now increase rates without damaging the US economy. ""The Fed is finding a very subtle way to temper the enthusiasm around the risks of a sustained dollar bull market that gets out of control,"" said Alessio de Longis, a macro strategist in New York at OppenheimerFunds, whose division oversees $11.6 billion. ""What the Fed is trying to decelerate a bit is this dollar appreciation in order to make sure that the transition to a Fed hiking policy is more gradual.""
 
 The greenback's gains this year added to a 13 per cent jump in the second half of 2014 that was its strongest advance since 2008, even as the US economic recovery started to disappoint. The Citi Economic Surprise Index shows US economic data are falling short of expectations by the most in more than two years.
 
 Officials are inclined to keep rates near zero for longer, with many participants saying a premature rate increase might damp the economic recovery, the minutes show. Participants flagged the ascendant dollar's negative effect on net exports, with a few pointing to the risk the currency could appreciate further. Mitigating those dangers are low energy prices, which may have a greater-than-forecast positive impact on growth, and accommodative policy overseas that supports the international outlook, the Fed said.
 
 Central bankers from Australia to Canada to Sweden are among those implementing monetary policies to boost growth. That stimulus has weakened their exchange rates, which helps make their economies more competitive, a knock-on effect that analysts have called a currency war. US companies are already feeling the pinch. They're having to learn to live with a dollar rally that doesn't necessarily reflect a stronger economy, Goldman Sachs's Cohn said. Retail sales and durable goods orders have weakened in recent months and multinationals, including Procter & Gamble Co and DuPont Co, are already seeing the strong currency weigh on earnings. The currency's strength makes it ""very tough"" for the Fed to lift interest rates this year, Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said this month.
 
 That said, consumer spending accounts for almost 70 per cent of gross domestic product, while exports comprise about 13 per cent.

UR Bhat: It should be sort of steady around these levels with a marginal downtick possible. 8000 may not be tested. But levels around 8000 is possible. What one needs to watch really closely is what is happening in Russia. Putin seems to be running out of luck. There is lot of opposition to the stance he has taken. Unless he is able to contain that, there could be huge impact on the emerging markets. It is time for us to watch that space closely. Other than that, as far as the domestic situation is concerned, results will pave the way for giving direction to the market. As long as the results are not surprisingly negative, the markets should find itself in the 8000-8500 range.

Does Sesa Sterlite look attractive as SC lifts ban?,"{""Sesa Sterlite"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/does-sesa-sterlite-look-attractive-as-sc-lifts-ban/articleshow/34075113.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Does Sesa Sterlite look attractive as SC lifts ban?,"MUMBAI: Shares of Sesa Sterlite slipped on profit-booking a day after the Supreme Court ordered lifted ban on iron ore mining in the state of Goa.
 
 The stock closed the day at Rs 193.70, down 8.10 points, or 4.01%.
 
 On the bad side, the apex court has imposed an interim restriction on the maximum annual excavation from the mining leases to 20 million tonne.
 
 According to analysts, with the lifting of ban, the production would begin in second half of 2014. Earnings from iron ore unit would add 5 per cent more to EBITDA.
 
 “The ruling comes across as a huge relief to iron ore producers in Goa, especially for Sesa Sterlite – the largest miner in the state. While actual resumption of mining will take 2-3 quarters as several regulatory approvals still need to be in place, the ruling clears the roadmap for restart of iron ore mining,” said IDFC report.
 
 According to the brokerage, the ruling is positive for the company and the financial benefits of the same will accrue in 2HFY15 as mining will commence with a lag of 2-3 quarters from the ruling. It factors in production of 5.2/12.6m tonnes in FY15/16.
 
 It has maintained ‘Outperformer’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 227 per share.
 
 According CLSA analysts, the Supreme Court’s decision is positive for the company. They expect operating performance to improve over the next two years. The mining capacity could get capped at 8-9 million tonnes but the lifting of ban will boost the company’s FY15 EPS.
 
 It has maintained a ‘buy’ on the stock with target of Rs 225.
 
 The company remains our top pick of Maybank Kim Eng in the materials sector.
 
 “The stock rallied 5 per cent following news of lifting of the mining ban. A favourable election outcome next month could spark a sharp rally in the stock price,” the report said.

Ennore Port to approach Shipping Ministry for IPO approval,"{""Ennore Port"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/ennore-port-to-approach-shipping-ministry-for-ipo-approval/articleshow/6664601.cms,m.economictimes.com,Ennore Port to approach Shipping Ministry for IPO approval,"
  NEW DELHI: The Ennore Port will approach the Ministry of Shipping by the end of this month for approval of a plan to raise funds for business expansion through an IPO, a top government official said.
  
  ""Ennore Port may go for an IPO... they were asked to raise finances through this route, they would approach us... maybe in a month's time,"" a Shipping Ministry official said.
  
  However, the percentage of disinvestment by the government and the amount of fresh equity to be raised through the IPO is yet to be decided.
  
  The decision was taken at an Ennore Port board meeting last month.
  
  The Centre holds a stake of about 68 per cent in the Ennore Port and the remaining 32 per cent is held by the Chennai Port Trust.
  
  The Department of Disinvestment (DoD) had asked the Shipping Ministry to opt for an initial public offer rather than raise funds through private placement and the ministry informed the Ennore Port regarding the same.
  
  The Ennore Port is the only corporatised major port and is registered as a company. The port has been able to attract an investment of Rs 2,600 crore by private entrepreneurs on various terminals and harbour craft.
  
  Construction of a car export terminal at the Ennore Port is in progress, which Japanese car-maker Nissan Motors will use to export 1,80,000 cars per year once fully executed, though exports are expected to commence this month.
  
  Construction of the terminal will cost Rs 110 crore and the facilities will include a berth, a 12-metre draft after dredging of the basin and a parking yard of 1,75,000 square metres.
  
  A coal terminal and iron ore terminal are also being developed at a total investment of Rs 880 crore.

ET Now: How are you reading into this tempted pullback from the market in the last hour for three successive sessions now, does it seem like this pullback can sustain itself? 

 
Mitesh Thacker: I have been slightly biased towards the positive side for last one or two sessions and I have said that the pullbacks in declining market are typically choppy. So, we have seen the choppiness. The pullback is far from over the intraday indicators the trend falling ones are still in a rising mode. Until, we start getting below 5150 I would maintain a slightly positive bias if I am trading with extreme short term horizon and look at pullback to about levels of 6100-6120 which is what I have been maintaining for last few days. In fact, given the way the short term charts are kind of diverging from the medium terms charts there could be possibility of a range bound consolidation happening in the markets for the next few days. So, 6100 to about 5950 could be a range which the market might remain in for the next five to six sessions.

Normally, that is good oversold level from where the markets bounce back and that is exactly what is happening. On the upside, we may not break 6060-6100 on the Spot Nifty, may act as a resistance. The longer term trend, the weekly charts are still bearish. So I would say as far as the Nifty is concerned at higher levels nearer 6100, I would still be a seller. Now whether we break 5950-5900, that remains to be seen but broadly, 5950 to 6100, this 100-150-170-point range is where I see the Nifty moving in. There are two long shadows for the past two days that indicates buying at lower levels but that also talks of a lot of choppiness and I expect that to continue. So I cannot say that we have made a bottom and we will go up one way. Lot of choppy moves expected in the next few trading sessions with the Nifty moving between 5950 and 6100. "

A breakout above that would have extended this pullback rally by about 100 points. It might happen in the next one or two days. Else, what we have done is that we have made an important low around 7,700 on the index. My sense is that we might trade in a range of about 7,700 to 7,850.

ET Now: How should one approach trade next week?
 
 
Sandeep Wagle: I wish to first address whether it makes sense buying stocks after three days of an upmove. I believe it makes better sense now to buy into. I was not sure till the beginning of the Friday’s trading session. But after an initial hour, we saw Nifty comfortably trading above 8,500-mark and. It was a very clear breach on the upside. Whatever be the reasons, now we are in for a move from 8,400. Nifty is in a range of 8,450 to 8,650 and I believe that the bottom has been reached.
 
 The bearish view that we had is over. The bulls are not willing to let go and we will certainly test 8,650 or probably even one shade higher than that, may around 8,700-8,750levels. On a correction of 30-50 points, I would be a buyer on Nifty as well. All this while, it was more of a stock-specific day. Now, the Nifty is ready to move towards 8,650-8,700 and, on the downside, 8450 may not be broken on the index. You can have a very close stop loss of 8,430 or so and play for a 200-250 point on the upside.

ET Now: The flarge cap IT companies are coming out and giving out warnings for the quarter three. TCS has done that, Tech Mahindra told us that in an interview, HCL Tech has given out that bit of a warning today for the quarter three as well. How wary would you be of further incremental investments in large cap IT? 

 
Deven Choksey: It is a good point and I certainly believe that given the valuation at which these companies are trading, if they continue to command the premium valuations, then probably the question would be whether they could sustain the growth and they could produce higher amount of growth. At this point of time, I do believe that the things are not completely out of control. Maybe in this quarter, it was expected that they may probably miss out some part of the targets. I would think that we will wait for the commentaries to come from the management of some of these companies at the end of the quarter results and probably see where exactly they would like to take up the businesses going forward. My reading says that some of the newer areas of the business would probably drive the growth in these companies and that is where we would probably keep an eye on and see how exactly they keep winning some of the inorganic growth strategies which certainly in some of the companies cases may sound little bit more promising at this point of time. So we will wait for the commentary of the management to come. At this point of time, we are not taking any view on buying side of the large IT companies. We are basically more focussed and stay invested with some of the midsize IT companies where the growth is relatively more promising and we see the valuations also remaining in favour of investors to add them into the portfolios.

Has RIL turned the corner? Some analysts think so,"{""RIL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/has-ril-turned-the-corner-some-analysts-think-so/articleshow/45568256.cms,m.economictimes.com,Has RIL turned the corner? Some analysts think so,"MUMBAI: Will Reliance Industries be able to snap its 7-year disappointing run on Dalal Street in 2015? After underperforming the Sensex since 2008, foreign brokerages believe that Reliance is poised to perform better on the bourses next year as the stock is cheap after the recent correction.
 
 Reliance shares have risen about 3% so far in 2014 against the Sensex’s advance of 32% in the period. From their 52-week high in May, the stock is down almost 23% and is trading near the 2012 share buyback price of Rs 870. The stock closed at Rs 880 on Thursday.
 
 

 
 Analysts at brokerages such as UBS, Citi, and Nomura see this underperformance as an opportunity to buy as they believe all negative news and investor concerns are priced into the stock. “RIL’s strong positioning, relatively attractive valuations against regional refining and petchem peers, and stock hovering around its 2012 buyback price of Rs 870 give attractive upside potential.
 
 Hence, we have put a price target of Rs 1,400 on the stock,” said Ashish Jagnani, analyst at UBS. Before 2008, Reliance Industries was the most influential stock on the domestic bourses and was a must-have in every investor portfolio.
 
 After that, the stock lost its popularity among investors.
 
 More recently, investors have been worried about the volatility in its refining margins, telecom launch, lowerthan-expected gas prices and uncertainty over shale gas production in the wake of the drop in crude prices. Analysts are, however, optimistic about the company’s prospects.
 
 “RIL is likely to turn around in 2015 as the focus will be on the much-anticipated telecom launch. However, the spotlight is also likely to be on the fast-completing petchem and refining expansion plans, which will be a key driver of 70% earnings growth in the next 4 years,” said Anil Sharma, analyst at Nomura.
 
 Analysts expect investors to become favourable towards RIL stock, going forward, as the company's $8.5 billion petchem investment will become operational in phases by 2016.
 
 “We have a price target of Rs 1,120 on RIL stock, and even under bearish assumptions, we have a stress-case valuation of .`950, which is about 10% above the current price levels implying favourable risk-reward ratio. The rupee depreciation is expected to provide further cushion for the stock price,” said Saurabh Handa, analyst at Citi.

Hemindra Hazari: Yes I do believe so. But, if you see the index of industrial production (IIP) readings for the consumer durables sector, you will find them unimpressive. The numbers may suggest that there are only a handful of companies in the white goods space that are apparently doing well. White goods space looks in doldrums, if you consider tepid IIP numbers for the sector. Hence, one has to be very stock-specific rather than having a sectorial view in the present economic environment.

HCL Q3 Results: Five things to watch out for,"{""HCL"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/hcl-q3-results-five-things-to-watch-out-for/articleshow/46995913.cms,m.economictimes.com,HCL Q3 Results: Five things to watch out for,"NEW DELHI: HCL Technologies, the fourth-largest largest Indian information technology player, which reports its third quarter results in Tuesday, is expected to lead growth among the Indian IT companies in the March quarter, even as it deals with cross-currency headwinds. 

 Last week, bigger rival TCS posted its worst quarter in nearly five years, because of cross currency movements impacting its topline. 

 Here are five things to watch out for in HCL Technologies’ results: 

 1. Growth: HCL Technologies’ growth in constant currency is expected to be around 3.9%, according to analyst estimates, while in reported currency, it is likely to be under 1%. HCL said in March it expects adverse cross-currency impact of about 280 basis points impact on revenue growth in US dollars for the quarter ending March 31. 

 However, HCL is the top pick for analysts who expect it to lead growth in constant currency among Indian IT companies for the March quarter. 

 2. Margins: Currency fluctuations are also likely to hit the company’s margins, which are expected to decline by nearly 80 basis points, dues to high exposure to infrastructure management contracts which were signed in a weak rupee environment, according to Kotak Institutional Equities analysts. 

 3. Deal wins and Pricing: A number of large deals are up for renewal this year and analysts will be watching for commentary on pricing. IT companies have said that basic services are being increasingly commoditized and clients are focusing on productivity improvements through the use of robotics and automation. 

 4. Client Budgets: Earlier this month, analyst firm Gartner said worldwide IT spending would decrease 1.3% to $3.66 trillion in 2015 due to a stronger dollar. This latest estimate was a cut from its previous expectation of growth of 2.4%. 

 The investor community is likely to look out for commentary on demand from clients in 2015 and the number of large deals signed. 

 5. Growth in IMS and Software services: Analysts and investors will also keenly watch the company’s performance in its software services business, led by engineering services, hence the volume growth in engineering services, where it has a large play, will be a key metric to watch out for. Growth in HCL’s fastest growing business IMS has been cause for some concern in the past and investors will watch out for growth prospects in this business.

HDFC seeks to raise Rs 1000 crore via bonds,"{""HDFC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/hdfc-seeks-to-raise-rs-1000-crore-via-bonds/articleshow/35701045.cms,m.economictimes.com,HDFC seeks to raise Rs 1000 crore via bonds,"MUMBAI: The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s largest mortgage lender, on Wednesday launched its first private bond issue in 2014-15 to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore, offering about 9.13% for a 366-day maturity. The issue came after a 2-month lull as firms were seeking exemption on certain redemption reserve requirements under the amended Companies Act. On the first day, the company raised about Rs850 crore, according to merchant bankers familiar with the development. 

 The issue generated considerable interest among institutional investors, including foreign institutional investors, mutual funds, insurers and corporate houses. A foreign institutional investment arm of a large European bank may have bought more than Rs 500 crore of this AAA-rated debt instrument, two domestic institutional investors told ET on condition of anonymity. 

 However, an email sent to HDFC remained unanswered at the time of going to press. ""After a long time, a toprated issuer brought out an issue following exemption from the government. Issues are likely to rise in June,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, adding that yield is attractive as the 1-year bank certificate of deposit is quoting about 9%. Bond yields move inversely to prices. 

 The yield spread or a gauge for pricing, which is currently 13 basis points, was about 20-25 bps last time when the housing finance company had raised funds prior to April. This suggests a better pricing for the company this time. In the secondary market, HDFC bonds maturing in 2016 are currently quoting yields in the range of around 9.25-9.35%, 20-30 bps lower than one-month earlier levels. 

 ICICI Securities Primary Dealership and Deutsche Bank are the two investment bankers for the issue. Last week, EThad reported that the ministry of corporate affairs had issued a notice granting exemption to all non-banking finance companies from maintaining 50% debenture redemption ratio (DRR), which was mandated for public issuers earlier, but at 25%.

"Healing process continues, investors need to be patient: CLSA","{""CLSA"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/opinion/interviews/investors-need-to-be-patient-with-india-story-rajeev-malik-clsa/articleshow/47293654.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Investors need to be patient with India story: Rajeev Malik, CLSA","In a chat with ET Now, Rajeev Malik, Senior Economist, CLSA, shares his views on the Indian economy, how the Modi government is faring, the rupee and more. Excerpts: 
 
 
ET Now: The Modi government has completed a full year. What is your own assessment of how the government has faired out in term of reforms as well as policy measures, which have been undertaken to aid economic growth?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: The whole context of reform has to be seen in a larger picture. Do not forget that Mr Modi inherited an economy which had a fair number of problems that had to be fixed and all these cannot be fixed overnight, which is where we had been warning that expectations -- both in terms of scope and speed with which things are going to be done -- seem to be unrealistically high.
 
 So it has been a productive year. There is still a certain sense of disappointment of under-delivery, but that is despite some meaningful hits that the government has recorded. Do bear in mind this certain sense of disappointment has to be seen in the context of unrealistically high investor expectations. So a very healthy reset of expectations is taking place.
 
 There are clearly areas -- for example, the MAT tax issue which was almost like a self-inflicted injury – which could have been totally avoided. But all in all, the healing process from a macro perspective continues. This government has more time. I mean the initial sense of disappointment is understandable, but the correction is much more relative to where expectations were in the stratosphere. I still believe Mr Modi remains the person most capable of bringing about a transformational change in India. I would only reiterate what I have been mentioning for quite some time that investors will just have to be patient.
 
 
ET Now: You also believe that lower-than-expected IIP and easing CPI have only strengthened the case for another rate cut. Do you think there is a case for it to be out of policy?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: Has it strengthened the case for another rate cut? Absolutely. Can it be out of policy? That possibility is always there. Do not forget the two rate cuts this year were out of policy and also consecutive. So, in a way the central bank itself has shown a poor discipline of sticking to scheduled policy meetings, which is what it should be doing.
 
 Out-of-policy moves are made under really extreme distressing circumstance and it is difficult to make the case for any of those as far as India is concerned. So, what additional information is going to get waiting until early June beats me. I cannot totally rule out any intermeeting move, but if not even in early June, the case for a rate cut remains because the actual picture on the monsoon will not come about until the month of July passes.
 
 
ET Now: Some of the economists also see Reserve Bank of India cutting rates followed by a prolonged pause. Would you agree that there is an upside risk to inflation and what is the cumulative rate cut expectations in 2015?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: Do not forget that our case had always been that market expectations since the beginning of the year of an aggressive easing by RBI were unfounded and certainly unrealistic. One, purely in terms of how much oil prices had dropped, it was debatable whether that would be sustainable and we have seen roughly $20 increase since the bottom already come through.
 
 I do not think it is as much a risk of inflation picking up in any meaningful manner as much as people missing the broader picture that RBI’s game plan, unlike ever in the past, is also to facilitate a downshift as far as trend inflation is concerned. This has to play out even as the economic growth picks up over the next two to three years. So, my sense remains we have at least one more rate cut and if the monsoon is not as disappointing as is feared, there could possibly be one more rate cut, but that is about it.
 
ET Now: One of the other points that you make is IIP where the growth has slowed. However, what are the key trends that you are watching on the lead economic indicators? Is the economic recovery showing any kind of pickup at all?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: One of the more challenging aspects, which are unique to India, is that the revision on the GDP methodology creates a big gap between the synchronisation of what the bottom up high frequency indicators are suggesting versus what the revised GDP methodology has suggested. What I mean by that is, while the GDP numbers or the revision or the new methodology show a much perky momentum, as far as growth is concerned, at 7.4% for last year advanced estimates, that is slightly better this year. The ground evidence does not really necessarily support that.
 
 The economy is growing at 7-7.5%, carry a certain spring in their step which is pretty much conspicuous by its absence as far as India is concerned. So, in that way it will very much continue and create a certain element of uncertainty whether India is really recovering, stabilising or it is actually slowing down further. So those questions will continue and we really cannot do much about that.
 
 The corporate sectors results do not seem to suggest any meaningful improvement coming through and all of this has to be seen in the context that recovery in India was very much meant to be uneven and gradual in the initial phases. You are dealing with a $2-trillion economy where the investment cycle, given some of the supply-side issues it is dealing with, and policy-related issues will take time to heal and begin to show itself. So even for FY16, we expect a very marginal improvement, 7.6 at best.
 
 
ET Now: Let us talk about the rupee and the 10-year paper. What is your sense there? What could be the range for the rupee in the medium term and where do you think that 10-year paper will finally settle?
 
 
Rajeev Malik: Our rupee view really has not changed. It is rather boring, I understand. Markets have flip-flopped. I still think the rupee will move lower to 67 in a year’s time. What continues to be overlooked for example is while everyone celebrates the big decline in India’s inflation, what is ignored is that India still has the second highest inflation in Asia and that is simply because the broader global disinflationary impact of, for example, commodity price correction was favourable to inflation in other countries as well.
 
 So India’s inflation differential continues to argue why the rupee should actually depreciate. It is just that the magnitude of portfolio flows has pushed the currency away from where perhaps it should be given the state of the real economy and the RBI itself given the fact that it has been mopping up reserves by intervention shows that it has not been comfortable with letting it to appreciate. So a gradual depreciation is still very much going to be the order of the day. India is much more resilient today, but that does not mean that it is completely immune to any adverse global event as such.

  In the beginning of the week, we had said that 5800 would not be crossed but 6360-6350, the prior top, was likely to be tested and I see the Nifty in that way. Immediate target is 6230-6250 and before that it takes 6350. It is a matter of time and the way it has given a clear breakout today says it all. So there should not be any doubt and I am very clear that it will happen much before Diwali.

Indian markets not trading at cheap valuations: Anish Damania,"{""Indian markets"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/indian-markets-not-trading-at-cheap-valuations-anish-damania/articleshow/34071400.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Indian markets not trading at cheap valuations: Anish Damania,"In a chat with ET Now, Anish Damania, Head-Institutional Equities, IDFC Securities, shares his views on market environment.
 
 
ET Now: What is your take on absolute valuations for the Sensex? Even though Nifty and the Sensex they both are sitting at a record high, some would argue that valuations for Indian markets are still not stretched.  Anish Damania: One needs to look at in contrast with the other market. So typically, we need to also look at the multiples in relation to the interest rates.
 
 So we have a 10-year government yield at about 9% and if we really take it that equities is a function of one by the bond market, then you have 11 to 12 PE in a slow growth environment.
 
 In a higher growth environment, you can give a better multiple but having said that, we are yet to see the higher growth environment come through. One is not very certain about it, it is still sometime away. So in relation to where the interest rates are, it is not a cheap market.

Infosys' March guidance for next fiscal is very crucial,"{""Infosys"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/infosys-march-guidance-for-next-fiscal-is-very-crucial/articleshow/5438781.cms,m.economictimes.com,Infosys' March guidance for next fiscal is very crucial,"For long, the Infosys management has managed the art of pegging expectations lower and then surprising the Street. During the pervious earnings call, the company had guided for a dismal performance in the December ‘09 quarter. But on Tuesday, when the country’s second-largest IT exporter unveiled its quarterly numbers, investors were more than amused. A stronger sequential growth in business volumes at lower operating and administrative costs resulted in better-than-expected sales and profit growth. Infosys shares rallied by 4% on Tuesday, as investors caught by surprise bought into the shares of the Bangalore-based company.Dollar-denominated revenues shot up by close to 7% sequentially to touch the highest-ever quarterly level of $1,232 million. The sharp rise that followed the sluggishness seen in the previous few quarters, underlines the demand recovery. This is also evident from the 12.5% growth in the revenue contribution of the top 10 clients. Here again, the double-digit growth was visible after a long time. It largely reflects recovery in US banking and finance segments.Two other strong indicators of improving demand are the upward revision in the FY10 guidance and higher intake of new employees. In stark contrast with its earlier guidance of over 4.8% drop in earning per share (EPS), Infosys now expects FY10 EPS to grow by 2.4% to around Rs 107. Also, it plans to add 4,000 more employees by the end of the fiscal than what it had indicated earlier. What is also interesting to note is that Infy’s growth mirrors higher earnings quality in terms of margins and receivables days. Despite salary hikes during the December quarter that reduced operating margin by 200 basis points (bps), the company actually improved its margin by 90 basis points. Higher employee utilisation and lower expenses were the key drivers.Infy has also improved its efficiency in collecting outstanding sales. It now takes 57 days to collect receivables, five less than in FY09. At the Monday’s close of Rs 2,587, the Infy scrip is available at 24 times its FY10 estimated earnings. According to Dipen Shah, VP-research at Kotak Securities, Infy is likely to report an EPS of Rs 124 in FY11, thus signalling a forward P/E of 21. He has assumed a lower profit growth of 15% since Infy has indicated that its tax outgo relative to before tax profit would rise to 25% from 21% now. This is because the proportion of its tax exempt revenue has reduced from as much as 93% in FY08 to current 70%. ‘This may reduce EPS by Rs 4-5 for FY11,’ Mr Shah reckons.Analysts such as Mr Shah have upgraded Infy’s scrip to the ‘buy’ category, after its December quarter performance. Infy’s numbers reveal that the worst is behind us. Going ahead, demand is likely to be buoyant as discretionary spends are gradually back on track. With recruitment in full swing, Infosys appears to be well prepared to take advantage of the recovery. The March quarter would be crucial since the company would provide its next year guidance and its commentary on the IT budget scene in the US."

"IOC investor roadshows in Singapore, Hong Kong this week","{""IOC"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/ioc-investor-roadshows-in-singapore-hong-kong-this-week/articleshow/25992645.cms,m.economictimes.com,"IOC investor roadshows in Singapore, Hong Kong this week","NEW DELHI: After roadshows in the US and the UK, government will this week hold investor meets in Singapore and Hong Kong for sale of its 10 per cent stake in nation's largest oil firm, Indian Oil Corp (IOC). 

 ""Promotional roadshows were last week held in US and London. They will now be held in Singapore and Hong Kong beginning tomorrow,"" an official said. 

 Officials from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Department of Disinvestment will hardsell the IOC stake sale, which is crucial for meeting government's investment target of Rs 40,000 crore. 

 The proposed issue of 19.16 crore IOC shares is likely to fetch as much as Rs 3,900 crore at current prices. 

 At the roadshows last week, IOC was sold to investors as ""The Future of India Energy."" 

 In the presentation to investors, it was highlighted that IOC is the largest refiner in the country which has ""Strong support from the Government of India"" and is ""Driven by a Management Team that has Delivered Results."" 

 IOC has 10 refineries with 65.7 million tonnes of crude oil processing capacity, which constitutes 31 per cent of the domestic refining capacity. It has 11,000-plus km of crude oil, product and natural gas pipelines and a 44 per cent fuel market share. Also, it is the second largest petrochemical firm in the country behind Reliance Industries. 

 It is expanding its footprint in oil and gas exploration, LNG, wind and solar power besides venturing into nuclear energy to become an integrated energy company, the presentation said. 

 IOC, it said, is investing USD 2.077 billion in core business of oil refining and marketing and petrochemicals and has plans to invest USD 2.448 billion in the next. It has an capital outlay of USD 2.09 billion for 2015-16 and USD 2.009 billion for 2016-17. 

 IOC Chairman R S Butola had just before the US and UK roadshows stated that the department of disinvestment (DoD) may be wanting to assess the market conditions at the roadshows and will take a view on the stake sale based on the response. 

 The company was of the opinion that the government should not lauch the stake sale now as the company share price is ""unduly depressed"". 

 The IOC scrip today closed at Rs 203.15 on the BSE, 46 per cent below the 52-week peak of Rs 375 reached on January 18. 

 Government holds 78.92 per cent stake in the country's largest oil refiner as on June 30. 

 Citibank, HSBC and UBS Securities are among the five merchant bankers selected to manage the IOC share sale.

I would not like to add any further investment into IT. Just remain invested and wait and watch how this sector shapes up,"" says Dipan Mehta, Director, Elixir Equities
 

Let us talk about the market texture right now, the fact that FMCG is making a comeback, the fact that some of these textile retail plays are all sitting at all-time highs irrespective of the rich valuation that these stocks are quoting at clearly gives you a sense that the upcoming festival season is going to be a bumper one for the consumption space.We are gearing up for a very good earning season and the last two-three earnings season were impacted by higher commodity prices but a lot of commodity consumers have passed on those price increases. We should have the two major variables being positive for most Indian corporates. That being higher, top line growth and improvement in operating profit margins as price increases are being passed on.
 
We are seeing a decent amount of interest coming through in almost every sector with the exception of perhaps commodities and software companies where the earnings may be slightly on the softer side. But by and large, we should see a very good earning season. That is driving a lot of interest into stocks. We have the issues of Ukraine and higher interest rates, but the underlying fundamentals of the Indian economy are sound and improving by the day. 
 

We all know how Britannia, Unilever, ITC stocks have done but the interesting thing is happening within the textile/retail space. From bigger ones like Trent, Aditya Birla Fashions to Go Fashion to Arvind Limited, all are excited. Would you still recommend buying into it?We are very positive on the retail space and after a torrid time during the Covid restrictions, we are seeing retail coming back very strongly, especially offline retail. A lot of clothes are coming into stores and that certainly is very good for the retail players. Top pick with usual disclosure that we and our clients are invested, would be something like Vedant Fashions. 
 
I know it is expensive but it faces the least amount of threat from online players because when you go for an occasion like marriage, you need to try on those clothes and you cannot really buy them online. Second, a newly listed company is Go Fashions. Theri quarterly numbers have been quite impressive and there has been a very decent runway for growth as well.
 
Valuations are reasonable if you compare some of the other retail companies. These are the two top picks. Both are new listings but one of the dark horses could be V-Mart, only thing that last quarter numbers were a bit disappointing and it has a lot of exposure to rural markets which are a bit soft at this point of time but the underlying business model is excellent so I would say that go for the midcap stocks within the retail space and they should do pretty well. Other stocks also look interesting and if you are holding the likes of Aditya Birla Fashion, Trent, Avenue Supermart, all of them should do pretty well going forward.


How are you looking at the diagnostics and hospitals space and what would your top bets be?Healthcare should do very well going forward but one needs to be a bit selective over there. I would avoid pharmaceutical companies. They had a great time during Covid and a lot of opportunities worked out very well for them.
 
But I think the time is not right for the sector as a whole because of what is happening in the US generics market and increased competitive intensity in the domestic market. We are seeing challenges in the laboratory space, the path lab segment, with new entrants and increased competition. 
 
In my opinion, the best way to play healthcare would be through hospital companies like Apollo, Max Healthcare and Narayana Hrudayalaya.They all have come with a very decent set of numbers and valuations are reasonable. A lot of these companies are going in for expansion of existing capacities which they have set up and are now seeing very good utilisation levels as well. So it is very positive over there. 
 
A company to watch could be even Krishna Medical which is quite an efficient, regional player. I think it is trading at a slight discount to its peer groups. So there is a lot of opportunities within the healthcare space but let us focus mainly on the hospitals I think they should do very well going forward.
 

What is the outlook on the defence space? In the last one to two years, nearly 200 items have been added to the defence import embargo list. The Russia-Ukraine war has aso put a lot of emphasis on indigenisation and a number of these stocks have been active of late. Is there merit in betting on the defence theme?I think defence has hit a purple patch, especially PSU defence companies and they are sitting on very decent order book position; margins are stable and investors have a lot of confidence in these companies because of the earnings visibility on account of multi-year order book position.
 
Gradually valuations have also moved up but by and large, it is a well discovered, well researched sector and stock prices have moved up. Our view would be slightly neutral on it. May be if there is a market correction or sector specific correction, then these stocks could be interesting and provide a higher return then buying them at these levels but existing investors should remain completely invested. From an investment perspective, I would like to buy it at a decline rather than these levels.
 

What is your take on IT? The rupee has been weakening and is at a record low against the dollar. Today Accenture will come out with its earnings and that will be important because that will tell you how the FY23 outlook is with respect to their client budget etc. How should one be positioned in the IT sector?Wait and watch. Let us see what these IT companies have to report, how the new order positions are shaping up and let us see what the management has to say in terms of the demand scenario. In the past whenever there has been a recession in US and Europe, IT companies have seen declining to stagnating revenues and a steep decline in their valuations as well. 
 
As we speak, the time to sell IT has gone. They corrected by 20% to 40% or so. If you are invested in IT stocks, all you have to do is just wait out the stressful times for the global economy and hope that in six to 12 months, demand will start reviving. Now the entire industry has been telling us that IT spending is no longer as discretionary as before and maybe that will get tested in this quarter and the next. It is interesting time for the sector but I would not like to add any further investment into IT. Just remain invested and wait and watch how this sector shapes up.

 After nod to the composite scheme of arrangement amongst Jindal Stainless and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries, the meeting is being convened following directions from the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. 

 The Court has asked the stainless steel maker to convene ""meetings of equity shareholders, secured creditors and unsecured creditors"" for considering the composite scheme of arrangement among the four companies, according to a filing to the BSE. 

 On April 13, the company, through postal ballot, had sought the approval of public shareholders on the composite scheme of arrangement between Jindal Stainless, Jindal Stainless (Hisar), Jindal United Steel and Jindal Coke and their respective shareholders and creditors. 

 The domestic stainless steelmaker had last month received stock exchanges' nod for the proposed demerger, a move aimed at boosting profitability and paring debt. 

 At present, the steel maker's debt stands at about Rs 8,500 crore, as per a company source, who said that this will come down by Rs 5,000 crore post-restructuring. 

 According to the sources, this Rs 5,000 crore debt will be borne by the three companies which will help Jindal Stainless to complete the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) programme, which has been underway since 2012. 

 In December, the company's board had approved the plan. Under the scheme, Jindal Stainless proposes to demerge its ferro alloys and mining divisions and vest them with Jindal Stainless (Hisar). 

 It will also transfer stainless steel making facilities in Hisar to Jindal Stainless (Hisar) for a lump sum consideration of over Rs 2,809 crore. 

 Jindal Stainless will transfer the hot strip plant located in Odisha to Jindal United Steel by way of slump sale for Rs 2,412.67 crore, the company had earlier said. 

 The company also had proposed to transfer its coke oven plant in Odisha to Jindal Coke by way of a slump sale for Rs 492.64 crore. 

 Once the rejig scheme becomes effective, Jindal Stainless (Hisar) would seek listing of its equity shares on both the exchanges and its global depository receipts (GDR) at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. 

 As part of the scheme, the shareholders of the company would be issued shares by Jindal Stainless (Hisar) as per the share entitlement ratio of 1:1. 

 Apart from aiming at unlocking value for shareholders, increasing profitability, reduction of the debt and improvement of the serviceability of the debt, the rejig plan also aims to increase capacity utilisation, enable the backward integration, ensure long-term stability and focused management of different business verticals.

The foreign brokerage’s India strategist and head of research Jyotivardhan Jaipuria resigned last month, while its senior oil and gas analyst Vidhyadhar Ginde, capital goods analyst Jones Bhutta, telecom analyst Reema Verma and metals analyst Bhaskar Basu have also left the firm. 

 Jaipuria’s 23-year stint in Bank of America-Merrill Lynch will end in July. The brokerage is one of the largest among foreign firms in the country. Sources said a fall in the brokerage’s ratings resulted in these exits. 

 A Bank of America-Merrill Lynch’s spokesperson said, ""I can confirm that the people you mention have left the firm over the last year. We are focused on being the top research firm in India — as we are globally (and in Asia) for the last four years — and have added several top-ranked analysts to our team over the last few months."" 

 In 2014, according to Institutional Investor’s Rankings, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch’s Indian arm slipped to the second position from being the top-rated brokerage in 2013. Globally, the brokerage was voted number one for four consecutive years till 2014. The firm has replaced the old hands with other top-rated analysts from rival brokerages. 

 Sanjay Mookim from Credit Suisse is set to join as Bank of America-Merrill Lynch’s India strategist and will also be the oil and gas analyst. The foreign brokerage has decided to separate the head of research and strategist roles. Vikram Sahu, currently deputy research head, Asia, of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, will be entrusted with additional responsibility of head of research of the Indian arm of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. 

 The brokerage has hired Sachin Salgaonkar from Goldman Sachs to track telecom, media & internet, and Satish Kumar from Standard Chartered Securities to track metals and mining.

Legal tussle forces Sebi to re-think decision on self-regulation,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/legal-tussle-forces-sebi-to-re-think-decision-on-self-regulation/articleshow/32810301.cms,m.economictimes.com,Legal tussle forces Sebi to re-think decision on self-regulation,"MUMBAI: For Sebi chief UK Sinha and his team, an unexpected legal tussle is lurking around the corner. It pertains to self-regulation in India’s Rs9-lakh crore mutual fund (MF) industry.

An entity led by Justice BN Srikrishna, who headed the panel that recommended sweeping changes in the financial sector laws, besides having chaired several other committees, has taken the regulator to court. Financial Planning Supervisory Foundation (FPSF), a charitable organisation where Justice Srikrishna is a director, has challenged Sebi’s decision to grant preliminary permission to an arm of the nodal body of fund houses to act as a self-regulatory organisation (SRO).

Srikrishna will be the chairman of FPSF from April 1. The decision to move SAT was taken at a meeting chaired by him. However, it’s unclear whether FPSF will pursue the case if Sebi reviews its decision. Responding to ET’s email query, a Sebi spokesman said, “Sebi has received a representation from FPSF in the matter of granting in-principle approval in respect of application of Institution of Mutual Fund Intermediaries (IMFI) (set up by AMFI) for recognition as an SRO for mutual fund distributors. In light of the representation, Sebi is verifying facts. After following due process, the whole matter may be revisited, if so required.”

On February 6, Sebi gave in-principle approval to IMFI, promoted by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), to act as an SRO for distributors of mutual fund products. In its appeal filed on Thursday before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (or SAT) — a quasi-judicial authority — FPSF has observed that since the proposed SRO is for the ‘distributors’ of mutual funds, there would be conflict of interest if a company established by an industry group that has been protecting the interests of the manufacturers (or MF houses) is appointed as an SRO, and which would now be in charge of regulating the same distributors and agents of the same manufacturers’ financial products.


	 


As against this, FPSF, promoted by FPSB India, another charitable organisation comprising various differing interests, was set up with the objective to serve as an SRO “dedicated to the public interest while promoting objectives of enhancing market integrity, investors protection and market efficiency” among other things.

However, the hard legal argument made in the appeal puts a question mark on IMFI’s application to Sebi for becoming an SRO. Referring to records available with the ministry of corporate affairs, FPSF has pointed out that IMFI was incorporated on August 2, 2013, which was well after the deadline set by Sebi for receiving applications. By way of a public notice dated June 27, 2013, Sebi had declared July 31, 2013, as the last date for receiving applications from eligible applicants desirous of being recognised as an SRO. Therefore, Sebi, according to the appeal, had granted in-principle approval for acting as an SRO to a “phantom applicant which was not a legal person at the time of application”.

According to FPSB — which is keen to act as an SRO and had filed its application to Sebi on July 29 — this was in “direct and clear violation of Sebi’s SRO regulations and of common law principles and jurisprudence relating to incorporation creating a legal person”. The appellant has prayed the tribunal should set aside Sebi’s decision to grant an in-principle approval to IMFI for setting up an SRO for distributors, grant stay on all proceedings in relation to the selection and grant of final approval to IMFI, and direct Sebi to share with FPSF the grounds on which it was not granted an in-principle approval for recognition as an SRO.

ET Now: What would be the call on the banking pack? Considering now it really seems to be a no-no that the RBI is going to cut any sort of rates if not hike this monetary policy, what is the call now on the banking pack? How would you approach the space both private lot as well as PSU?
 
 
Harendra Kumar: Obviously this is a washout year for at least for the next two quarters for the banking space and the PSU clearly has in terms of what they have to do because of the action and squeeze in margins what they are seeing. So the private banks is a space where people are herded towards but clearly the choices are getting limited out there.
 
 If you ask us where the opportunities lie, they lie in some of the regional banks such as Jammu & Kashmir Bank, maybe Karur Vysya Bank and new private sectors like Yes Bank of an IndusInd Bank where the growth is relatively robust but overall as a space, clearly it is very difficult option to pick at this point of time.

Ashwani Gujral: The market was expected to be flat whether or not there was a policy. So it is just the technical position of the market where you have had strong rallies and now it is a period of sideways move for both Nifty as well as the Bank Nifty.
 
 What has gotten crunched down is the export space and probably that can perk the Nifty up for the next three to five sessions while the rest of the market consolidates/corrects.
 
 Nifty chances are around 6,630-6,640 and is likely to find support. Bank Nifty may have a little deeper correction, that too in a worst case scenario, 12,400 to 12,600; in that zone it should consolidate and then once this rest period is over - probably which will continue for the entire week - we could start moving up again.
 
 So this is a period where you keep your trading generally restricted in the domestic cyclicals and try to play the bounces on the export groups.

Maharashtra say no to Bt cotton seed price hike,"{""Bt cotton seed"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/maharashtra-say-no-to-bt-cotton-seed-price-hike/articleshow/8236063.cms,m.economictimes.com,Maharashtra say no to Bt cotton seed price hike,"
  PUNE: The Bt cotton seed companies have got a major blow as Maharashtra, the largest cotton growing state, refused to increase the price of Bt cotton seeds. This is likely to create a severe shortage of seeds in north Maharashtra’s irrigated cotton cultivation belt where sowing begins from Akshay Tritiya as the companies want to wait till they are able to convince the government on the price hike. 
  
  “We will again plead with the government to take cognizance of the increases in costs. Gujarat, the top seed producing state, has asked the seed companies to pay higher price to the farmers for seeds produced last year from this year’s sales. We are still hopeful that we will get the government to review their decision in next few days,” said Paresh Verma, chairman of National Seed Association of India. 
  
  Though the cotton prices have more than doubled in the last three years, state governments had kept Bt cotton seed prices fixed during the same period. The Maharashtra agriculture minister had recently announced that his government would increase Bt cotton seed prices if Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, the two major cotton growing states, do so. 
  
  Gujarat government had announced that it would increase Bt cotton seed prices by Rs 180 per bag for both Bollgard (I) and Bollgard (II). But the cotton farmers are unhappy with the hike in seed prices. The Gujarat government suffered another blow when the Gujarat High Court struck down the Gujarat Cotton Seed Act, which controls the cotton seed prices. 
  
  The government had to announce a rebate of Rs 100 per packet of Bt cotton seeds sold at the Kirshi Melas for maximum two packets per farmer. The Maharashtra government has kept its decision in abeyance, keeping a watch on the developments in Gujarat. This had led to a restlessness among seed companies and cotton farmers in Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar. The seed companies have not made the seeds available in the market as they are waiting for the new prices to be print on the seed packets.

 ""We have planned to more than double our capacity in the next two years to reach out to the untapped rural market. For this purpose, we plan to come out with an IPO to raise funds,"" Manpasand Beverages Chairman and Managing Director Dhirendra Singh told PTI.
 
 The company is likely to go public in FY 2016, he said. Manpasand manufactures mainly mango juices. It has three manufacturing facilities in Vadodara, Banaras and Dehradun.
 
 ""We want to set up four more factories to cater to tier II, semi-rural and rural markets. These factories will come up in Vadodara, Bangalore and one on the Bengal-Bihar border and expansion of Banaras facility,"" he said.
 
 Manpasand Beverages has a total capacity of 75,000 cases per day, which the company is looking to expand to 150,000 cases per day within three years.
 
 Indian food and beverages market in the FMCG sector is pegged at almost Rs 1.5 lakh crore.
 
 Manpasand, which expects to close the year with Rs 300 crore revenue, is eyeing over Rs 1,000 crore sales by 2016.
 
 ""We are present in 20 states through a large network of over 2 lakh retailers, 2,000 distributors and over 200 super stockists. To achieve our target, we need to expand our presence and we expect we will be able to cover the entire country in the next 2-3 years,"" Singh said.
 
 Besides, the company is also planning to go global by setting up a facility in Dubai.
 
 ""There is a huge demand for our flagship brand Mango Sip in the international market. We believe, by setting up a facility abroad we will be able to cater to a larger market,"" Singh said.
 
 Meanwhile, the company has roped in Bollywood actor Sunny Deol as its brand ambassador and launched a TV commercial to reach out to masses.
 
 ""Through this association and the new television commercial, we are confident Mango Sip will make inroads into the hearts of the customers,"" he added.

 Vishal Kshtriya, Edelweiss
 

 After witnessing a breakout, the Nifty index continued its uptrend and made a new life-time high. Importantly, the rally was driven by good volumes and positive market breadth, which shows that the ascent is more broad-based. The rally was further accompanied by a spurt in open interest in the F&O market, indicating long build-up. 

 On the F&O rollover front, we have seen ~55 per cent marketwide positions getting rolled over to the next F&O series. On the Nifty front, we have seen relatively lower rolls on the back of higher roll costs. Cost to rolls (for long) has been rising, which indicates long side roll aggression. Based on Nifty open interest options structure, we expect the March series to expire between 6600 and 6650. 

 Put-call ratio based on OI is trading at 1.14, which indicates that bias in the market is positive. The India Volatility Index (VIX) is trading in a narrow range of 16-18. Eventually, we expect a breakout in VIX in the coming days/weeks. Important level to watch out on the upside is 20. 

 In our last article, we had mentioned about the seasonality analysis of Nifty from which we concluded that we may see big moves in March. We have already seen MTD change in the Nifty of 5.5per cent. 

 Banking stocks followed by capital goods and auto have been the leaders in the current rally. We have seen huge long build-ups in stocks from these sectors. We have seen long build-up in ICICI Bank and we expect this stock to trade with a positive bias in coming months.

Pankaj Pandey: Yes, again a good set of numbers from them. In fact on the margin side we were expecting slightly muted margin but the margins come out to be good. The stock is trading at about 18 times FY16 basis so it is quite richly valued but given the consistency there will be marginal revision in the target prices from current levels of 1020. The concern for the stock would be that the domestic business last grew by 5% and probably at the sustainability of the margins or EBITDA margins of about 28%. So, these are the two concerns but there will be slightly marginal revision in the target prices but we will continue to maintain the positive bias in the stock.

Moderate earnings expected for IT companies in Q3: Analysts,"{""IT companies"": ""neutral""}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/moderate-earnings-expected-for-it-companies-in-q3-analysts/articleshow/28505795.cms,economictimes.indiatimes.com,Moderate earnings expected for IT companies in Q3: Analysts,"
 NEW DELHI: Seasonal impact of lesser working days and furloughs may result in moderate quarter-on-quarter revenue growth of 2-4 per cent for Indian IT firms like TCS and Infosys in the October-December 2013 quarter, analysts today said. 

 Traditionally, the October-December quarter is a weak quarter for IT companies as the number of working days is lesser compared to other quarters due to the holiday season at the client locations. 

 ""We expect tier-1 IT aggregate growth to moderate to 3.2 per cent q-o-q, given seasonal impacts of lesser working days and year-end shutdowns/furloughs,"" Nomura Equity Research said in a report. 

 It added that while TCS and Wipro are expected to lead the tally in terms of USD revenue growth, Infosys is likely to lag. The quarter is expected to be decent for Cognizant, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra. 

 The earnings season will be kicked off by Infosys announcing its numbers for October-December quarter on January 10, followed by HCL Technologies on January 16 and Wipro on January 17. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is yet to announce the date. 

 According to Angel Broking, volume growth in the quarter will be impacted by lesser working days, furloughs across industries and lower spending in verticals like retail, manufacturing and in services like consulting and enterprise solutions. 

 With the rupee appreciating marginally (on average basis), the revenue growth in rupee terms could get negatively impacted and trim down the operating margins of IT players by 0-10 basis points q-o-q. 

 For Q3 FY2014, in rupee terms, revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 1-3 per cent q-o-q for tier-I IT firms and 0.5-2.7 per cent q-o-q for tier-II companies. 

 IT analysts remain confident of the sector doing well in the following quarters. 

 ""We believe IT services demand is likely to continue to improve in FY2015 led by a better macroeconomic growth outlook. Preliminary discussions with IT companies and clients indicate that IT budgeting cycle for CY2014 is expected to begin on a positive note with signs of improvement in economic activities,"" Angel Broking said in its report. 

 Increasing offshore penetration in Europe and pick-up in discretionary spend in the US geography as well as demand for new technologies ie Social, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud is also likely to drive demand, it added. 

 Healthy pick-up in spending in key markets of North America and scope for accelerated market share gains in Europe can support about 15 per cent growth for the industry, which in turn can satiate the growth appetite of all players and reduce pricing pressure, Kotak Institutional Equities said. 

 ""We will watch for commentary on the outcome of clients' budgeting cycles to assess the strength of the demand environment and its sustainability,"" it added.

The company’s total income in the same period rose 23.7% to Rs 9,388 crore, from Rs 7,586 crore last year. “The third quarter last year was the worst for oil refineries. The inventory loss was at $14.37 per barrel,” MRPL chairman RS Sharma said in a statement.Public sector oil marketing companies depend on whether government compensates them for under-recoveries. Most of these companies didn’t get government support in the fiscal first half. The global business outlook for the petroleum sector is expected to be subdued, as refining players could likely see margin pressure with crude oil prices seeing downside risk if built-in growth expectations don’t fructify, say analysts.MRPL is already preparing for its future plans. Finance director LK Gupta said the company is aiming to raise Rs 4,000 crore by March 2012 to part finance its expansion. The company is expanding its refinery capacity to 15 million tonne. MRPL would import 12.1 million tonne of crude in the next fiscal year, compared with 12.5 million tonne last year. State-run Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) will lend Rs 5,000 crore to MRPL for expansion projects. Besides expanding its refining capacity, it is setting up a 450,000 tonnes a year propylene unit at an investment of Rs 1,804 crore. Both the projects are scheduled for commissioning by March 2012. “We will lend Rs 5,000 crore to MRPL at 3.85 percentage points lower than State Bank of India’s prime lending rate, which presently works out to 7.9%,” ONGC chairman and managing director RS Sharma said. Propylene can be converted into polypropylene, which is used in a wide range of industries. While MRPL will spend another Rs 5,000 crore from internal accruals, it would raise the balance Rs 4,000 crore in overseas debt by March 2012, Mr Gupta said. MRPL MD UK Bose said MRPL was ready to produce euro-iv grade petrol and would begin production of same grade diesel from April. The company may import 12.1 million tons of crude oil in 2010-11 fiscal, he said. Mr Basu said the company was also planning to invest Rs 1,000 crore in setting up a single-point mooring facility near the Mangalore port. SPM would help MRPL import crude oil in very large tankers. ONGC holds 71.62% stake in MRPL, while HPCL has about 14%. "

 As per earlier plan, the new norms were to take effect from July 7. 

 A DIS is used by sellers of securities to instruct their depository participants to debit their demat account. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India, which issued the norms on issuance and processing of DIS on January 7, had said that the new framework would come into effect after six months - July 7. 

 In a circular issued today, Sebi said: ""In light of the difficulties expressed by the depositories and the depository participants (DPs) and considering their request, it has been decided to make the circular effective from October 01, 2014. 

 Further, Sebi said that a period of one month may be given for receipt of DIS by the Beneficial Owners (BO). 

 ""The DPs may accept old DIS during this transit period. Further, while issuing new DIS the DPs shall intimate the BO that old DIS cannot be used after the new DIS is received,"" regulator added. 

 According to new guidelines, depositories needs to ensure that the DIS is standardised across all depository participants in terms of serial number and layout and size of DIS to facilitate scanning and easy retrievability of records. 

 The depositories would have to prescribe a standard method of serial number and ensure that these numbers are unique. 

 Also, DPs need to ensure that same DIS will not be used for giving both market and off-market instruction. Besides, a single DIS will not be used for transactions with multiple execution dates. 

 The depositories will have to ensure that their participants have adequate infrastructure, systems and processes to implement scanning, storage and transfer of the scanned DIS in the manner specified by the depositories. 

 They also need to ensure that the systems set up by the DPs maintain proper records of all scanned DIS images and put in place adequate checks and procedures to prevent unauthorised changes.

The Rs 1,000 crore issue, which opened for subscription on December 17, has already received bids worth over Rs 22,000 crore till 11 am of Wednesday. The issue closes on Thursday.  Data available on the BSE website showed Category I investors -- which include mutual funds, insurance companies and provident funds, among others -- have bid for 40.80 times the quota limit.  Categories II and III investors, which include cooperative banks and HNIs, have seen 35.28 per cent and 17.46 per cent oversubscription, respectively. Retail investors, who come under Category IV, have bid for 8.28 times the quota limit so far. The coupon rate for retail investors will be 7.39 per cent and 7.60 per cent for tenures of 10 years and 15 years, respectively.  NHAI has kept the option open to retain oversubscriptions worth up to Rs 9,000 crore. The face value of one bond is Rs 1,000 and it is being sold in lots of five units.  About 20 per cent of the Category I-III bonds will be allotted on a first-come-first-served basis, while the rest 80 per cent will be allotted on a proportionate basis.  Similarly, for Category IV, 40 per cent of the issue size will be allotted on first-come-first-served basis; and the rest 60 per cent on a proportionate basis.  Tax-free bond issues of public sector companies have witnessed huge interest among both retail and non-retail investors in recent times.  Like bank fixed deposits (FDs), tax-free bonds offer fixed interest to subscribers. But while bank FDs attract income-tax as per the standard tax slabs (10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent), tax-free bonds allow income-tax exemptions on long-term investment gains.  While the new issues are offering lower yields of between 7.1 per cent and 7.6 per cent based on tenures, these papers are expected to see good response, especially from investors who fall in higher tax brackets.  Earlier this month, a similar bond issue from the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) was oversubscribed 10.84 times, BSE data showed. The bond was sold between December 8 and December 10, but got oversubscribed within a few hours of its opening.  An offering from NTPC witnessed similar demand, recording 11 times oversubscription on the opening day itself. The state-run power company pre-closed the issue on September 23."

So we have started the journey from the higher end of the range possibly going towards the lower end of the range.  "

ET Now: What are the cues for the next few days? We have the inflation take coming out, but that aside, we are probably slated to go towards the December slumber sort of thing. What according to you will happen in the near term? 

 
Vineet Bhatnagar: It is going to be a combination of two things. There will be lower activity, but it's also the time when price magnification appears amplified. Also considering the fact that it is a quarter for many managers to print their NAVs, I do not think December should close at a lower Nifty level than what we saw in November. 

 However, at the same time, I also think that the Nifty looks very tightly range-bound. If you look at the way the F&O distribution is panning out, you will see that calls are concentrated at 8600-8700. So, it is a very tight range that we are looking at. 

 If 8640 or 8650 were to be taken out, only then we will have a better idea of how it will move. But having said that, there is no sign of any weakness if I look at the charts for the Nifty.

Nifty might retest earlier high of 7800: Mitesh Thacker,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/nifty-might-retest-earlier-high-of-7800-mitesh-thacker/articleshow/38797555.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty might retest earlier high of 7800: Mitesh Thacker,"In a chat with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, shares his views on the markets. Excerpts:  

 
ET Now: Lots happening in the market already first day of the week. How are you viewing the charts because we are still up about 0.5 per cent for the Nifty?  

 
Mitesh Thacker: Clearly today is an extension of the up move. We had a gap up which got filled but the index is comfortably placed above short term averages or the intraday moving averages. So the trend remains on the upside. As long as the index does not start breaking below 7640-7635, maintain a long bias and use any kind of dips to buy into the markets. The breadth is positive. That is good sign though the indices or the banking index is not doing much today despite the fact that couple of banking names are showing some kind of traction on the upside. But the overall idea is that with some kind of subduedness, with some kind of zick zack and choppiness and volatility the movement should be biased more on the upside and good chance that we will have a retest of the earlier high of 7800.

Nifty to test 6900 levels; top five trading strategies,"{""Nifty"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nifty-to-test-6900-levels-top-five-trading-strategies/articleshow/33949723.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nifty to test 6900 levels; top five trading strategies,"By Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker.com

As we enter truncated expiry week, we maintain our view that Nifty needs to sustain above the range of 6800--6820, which would give some strength and a possible test of levels of 6850 or even 6900/6980 levels.

Readers should note that on the weekly chart Nifty closed near the resistance trend line of an upward sloping channel. In case the Nifty fails to get past the resistance of 6820 levels (on the closing basis) it could be confined in the range of 6820 on the upside and 6650 on the on the down side.

A break below 6650 levels would be negative and trigger further declines to the level of 6580/6500 levels. It must be noted that momentum indicators are pointing upward.

In nutshell, above mentioned evidences suggest that a failure to sustain 6800 level on a closing basis, would keep the nifty confined within the range of 6820 level on the upside and 6650 on the downside.

Here is a list of top five trading strategies for the coming week:

State Bank of India: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 2125, keeping stop loss at Rs 1960

The short, medium and the long term chart clearly suggest that prices are in an uptrend. It has been moving up with strong momentum from Rs 1440 levels.

Last three day’s price action has formed a small flag pattern from which it has given a breakout in today’s trading session. Traders are advised to buy above Rs 2025 levels with a stop loss placed below Rs 1960 levels for targets of Rs 2125-2175 levels.

Jindal Steel Ltd: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 305, keeping stop loss placed below Rs 265

Jindal Steel stock prices have witnessed sharp correction in past 7-8 trading sessions from the highs of Rs 304.50 to the low of Rs 265 levels. After a 7 day correction, prices have rebounded from the 200-Day Moving Average and have closed above previous day’s high with higher volumes.

Thursday’s price action suggests that the short term correction seems to be over and prices are now ready to resume its up move. We recommend traders to buy on dips to Rs 277-275 for targets of Rs 300 -305 with a stop loss below Rs 265 levels.

ONGC: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 335, keeping stop loss placed below 312.80

The share price of ONGC was trading in a falling wedge formation after finding resistace from key resistance of Rs 325. With Thursday’s up move stock registered breakout from the above mentioned pattern.

The stock is also finding support from its cluster of moving averages. The momentum indicators for ONGC are also trending upward.

We have recommended buying the stock at current price with a stop placed at Rs 312.80 level for a target of Rs 332--335 and Rs 355.

ITC Ltd: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 374, keeping stop loss below Rs 344

After witnessing highs of Rs 365 levels ITC corrected up to the levels of Rs 336.70 and found support from its cluster of moving averages. Since then the share price consolidated for few days.

	 
With last week’s up move share price registered breakout from its swing high and the momentum indicators are also trading in a bullish mode.

We recommend traders to initiate long positions at CMP for targets of Rs 365 /374. We further recommend using a stop loss placed below Rs 344 for the trade.

Tata Motors Ltd: ‘BUY’ for a target of Rs 460, keeping stop loss below Rs 409

Tata Motors prices are moving in a strong uptrend in to a new life high territory (no resistance zone). The weekly momentum indicators are giving strong buy signals.

We expect prices to see further upmove until prices stay above Rs 409 levels. We recommend traders to buy on dip to Rs 422-425 with a stop placed below Rs 409 for immediate target of Rs 455-460 levels.

Sandeep Wagle: The Nifty50’s action is certainly inconclusive. Broadly, 8,000-8,150 band and more of a stock-specific play is what we are looking at. I would go for stocks than trading Nifty50 futures. I do not think there is any conclusive evidence that we may see any trend over the next couple of days.
 
 If we go higher by say 30-40 points, nearer 8,120-8,130 we may again see some selling. So if somebody wants to take a buy or sell call, it should be made at around that 8,120-8,140 range. On the downside, I do not expect 8,000 to be broken in a hurry.

  MUMBAI: After nearly five years, Japanese asset management firm Nikko and Ashok Wadhwa-promoted Ambit Group have reworked their partnership for the domestic mutual fund business. 
  
  
  The new joint venture will be 51:49, scrapping the earlier shareholding structure of 74:26. Nikko and Ambit’s mutual fund business has been delayed since they jointly announced in December 2006.The reason for the venture not taking off was due to market conditions, Ashok Wadhwa said on Monday.
  
  
  “Nikko will now hold 51% in the joint venture while Ambit will hold the remaining stake in the domestic mutual fund business,” said Ashok Wadhwa, Group CEO of Ambit on the sidelines of the conference, on the launch of its investment advisory business with Nikko.
  
  
  “In this competitive landscape to scale up is a challenge,” Wadhwa said. “Last month Nikko Asset Management India under the new shareholding pattern re-filed their application with market regulator Sebi,” he said.
  
  
  Besides, the mutual fund business Ambit has also entered into a joint venture with Nikko to expand their off-shore capabilities. On Monday, Ambit Holdings and Nikko Asset Management announced their new joint ventures in India and Mauritius.
  
  
  Under the new arrangement, Nikko Asset Management has picked up a 50.1% equity stake in Ambit Mauritius Investment Managers and a 49% stake in Ambit Investment Advisors for an undisclosed amount. Both the parties will manage and advise dedicated India funds with an initial corpus of $150 million.
  
  
  Andrew Holland who will be spearheading this initiative said he expects the assets under management of its offshore funds to grow to $1.5 billion over the next 3-5 years.

NMCE to launch select forward agri contracts this month,"{""NMCE"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/nmce-to-launch-select-forward-agri-contracts-this-month/articleshow/46212474.cms,m.economictimes.com,NMCE to launch select forward agri contracts this month,"NEW DELHI: The National Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (NMCE) plans to launch forward contracts in a number of agri commodities over the next few months. Trading in rubber, castor seed and rape seed contracts will commence this month. 

 Other contracts would be introduced based on the experience gained from the initial launch, managing director and chief executive Anil Mishra said. 

 “NMCE has got approval from the FMC (Forward Markets Commission) to launch forward contracts in 23 agri commodities,” he said. 

 Forward contracts in plantation crops like pepper, cardamom and kopra would be next in line. “We have a strong platform in plantation crops, where we see active participation of buyers and sellers to trade and hedge,” he said. 

 Potato and onion were other agriculture products which could be traded, he said. “We see a potential in forward contracts of onions and potato with delivery period of 11-12 days,” he said. 

 FMC member Nagendra Parekh said that apart from NMCE, the Multi Commodity Exchange was also preparing to offer forward contracts. Currently, the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange is offering forward contracts in 26 commodities. 

 NMCE is already holding training programmes for various stakeholders. “Government purchase and sales can also be done through this transparent national electronic platform,” he said. 

 The NMCE system would be auction-driven whereas others are having the order-driven system. “In an auction system, even if the seller has quoted a lower price, the market will decide the correct price depending upon the demand and supply,” said Mishra. “Whereas, in an order-driven system, if the seller has put an order at a lower price, and even if a buyer is available at a higher price later on, the seller would get the lower price. And, vice-versa in the case of a buyer.” 

 Forward trading is different from futures because these are customised contracts with respect to quality, date of delivery and place of delivery. “All the grades of a commodity can be traded in forward contract hence the scope will be much larger for hedging. The delivery locations also will be many as compared to limited delivery locations in case of futures contract,” Mishra said.

Nomura's top five largecap picks in an uncertain market,"{""Nomura"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nomuras-top-five-largecap-picks-in-an-uncertain-market/articleshow/26101057.cms,m.economictimes.com,Nomura's top five largecap picks in an uncertain market,"MUMBAI: The Indian markets have shown a sharp rally on the back of inflows from foreign institutional investors post second quarter results. 

 “Sector-wise, autos, pharma and telecom delivered positive surprises on EBITDA, while electrical equipment was the key miss,” said Nomura report. 

 In terms of strategy, the brokerage continues to prefer exporters, and private banks among rate cyclicals, but remains cautious on domestic growth cyclicals. It expects the Sensex to touch 22,000 by March-end. 

 
Following are top five investment ideas that can give healthy returns in the long term as the economy improves: 

 
HCL Technologies: Our target price of Rs 1,400 is based on 15x one-year-forward EPS of Rs 93, which is a 20 per cent premium to the stock's five-year average one-year forward P/E given 1) better EPS growth and margin trajectory; 2) improving cash generation and return profile; and 3) lower risks due to pushback of US immigration bill. The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price include a worse-than-expected slowdown, failure to exhibit stability in margins, and rupee appreciation against the USD. 

 
ICICI Bank: We arrive at our target price of Rs 1,300 by valuing the subsidiaries on a sum-of-the-parts basis at Rs 240 and using a three-stage residual-income valuation method for core banking business. 

 At our target price for the core bank, ICICI would trade at 1.7x our average FY14/15F ABV of Rs 624 and 11.9x average FY14/15F EPS of Rs 89.1 for an ROE of 15.5 per cent by FY15F. 

 The stock is currently trading at 1SD below its five-year mean. Given the strong earning trajectory, we expect ICICI to outperform the market. At our TP, the bank would trade slightly above its five-year mean P/ABV. 

 Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price are significant deterioration in asset quality and lower loan growth than expected by us. 

 
NTPC: Our target price of Rs 193 for NTPC is based on a sum of the fair value of its operating assets using a residual income (RI) model (Rs 101) + FY14F CWIP (Rs 57) + FY14F investment in JVs/subsidiaries (Rs 7) and non-operating financial assets (Rs 27). Our RI model assumes 13 per cent cost of equity, 15.5 per cent perpetual ROE (on regulated assets), and 2 per cent perpetual growth in core business income. The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Key risks include a decline in operational efficiency-linked incentives from FY13 levels, delays in commercial capacity accretion timelines and progress on bulk tender projects, tardy development of captive coal blocks, and a FY15-19 regulatory tariff regime that materially erodes profitability. 

 
Reliance Industries: We use the sum-of-the-parts valuation method to value RIL’s different businesses. For its core businesses, we use EV/EBITDA multiples. We use a 7x FY15F EV/EBITDA multiple for its refining and petrochemical business. We use DCF to value the company's new E&P business. Our target price is Rs 1,075 per share.The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Key downside risks are 1) deterioration in refining margins; 2) weakness in petrochemical margins; 3) further delays in the ramp-up of KG-D6 production volume; and 4) a sharper rupee appreciation versus the US dollar. 

 
Tata Steel: We value Tata Steel on an SOTP valuation, with our target price of Rs 443 consisting of Rs 615 (6x FY15F EV/EBITDA) for India operations, negative INR185 for Europe operations (5x FY15F EV/EBITDA), and INR13 for stakes in other businesses.The benchmark index for this stock is MSCI India. 

 Risks that may impede the achievement of the target price: We have built in steel prices corresponding to Chinese export prices of $560/tonne for FY14-15 as against a current price range of $600/tonne. However, if prices are worse than our expectations, there could be downside risks to our estimates. 

 We have built in 13.3-13.5 million tonnes of deliveries for European operations in FY14-15, down from 14 million tonnes in FY12. If the demand situation is worse than expected, there could be downside risk to our estimates.

 ""ITP was just launched in December end...We are expecting by this quarter end, by this March, eight to 10 listings,"" NSE Chief (Business Development) Ravi Varanasi told reporters here. 

 Stating that ITP was announced by the Finance Minister in his Budget speech, Varanasi said the platform is aimed at providing easier exit options for entities such as angel investors, venture capital funds and private equity firms, besides providing better visibility, a wider investor base and greater fund-raising capability to such companies. 

 ""The whole idea is to create a pipeline for growth companies to develop themselves over a period and turn into large companies,"" he said. 

 A company would be eligible for such a listing if it has not completed 10 years after incorporation, and its revenue has not exceeded Rs 100 crore in any of the financial years, he said.

NSE to launch trading in currency options on Friday,"{""NSE"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/nse-to-launch-trading-in-currency-options-on-friday/articleshow/6823024.cms,m.economictimes.com,NSE to launch trading in currency options on Friday,"
  NEW DELHI: The National Stock Exchange today said it will introduce trading in currency options on USD-INR (US Dollar-Indian Rupee) pair on Friday.
  
  The bourse has received approval from the capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of Indian and the RBI for introducing exchange traded currency options on US Dollar -Indian Rupee Spot rate, NSE said in a statement.
  
  ""Currency options contracts will be launched in the currency derivatives segment of the exchange on Friday,"" it added.
  
  The introduction of currency options will provide an alternative to investors for hedging against currency fluctuations.
  
  A derivative instrument, currency option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to exchange money denominated in one currency into another at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date.
  
  ""To begin with the exchanges shall offer three consecutive monthly contracts and 1 quarterly contract. New contracts shall be issued on expiration of an existing month contract,"" the NSE added.
  
  According to the bourse, USD-INR options contracts shall expire at 12 noon, two working days prior to the last business day of the expiry month.
  
  The Reserve Bank of India and Sebi jointly regulate these products. While RBI approves the products, Sebi decides on the trading platforms.
  
  Worldwide, the currency derivatives market is bigger than the equities market.
  
  Earlier this month, Sebi gave its nod to the NSE and the BSE-backed United Stock Exchange for starting trade in currency options, but another bourse MCX-SX blamed the market regulator for discrimination against it, saying thet it was yet to get the approval.
  
  At present, futures trading in four currency pairs is being offered through the exchanges. These pairs are Dollar- Rupee, Euro-Rupee, Yen-Rupee and Pound-Rupee.
  
  In July this year, Sebi allowed bourses to introduce currency options on the US dollar pairing with the rupee.
  
  Two year ago, the market regulator allowed exchanges to introduce currency futures, a forex derivative contract to buy or sell one currency against other on a specified future date, at a price decided in the contract.
  
  Initially, currency futures were limited to rupee-dollar only. But in January 2010, it was extended to three more currencies--the euro, the British pound sterling and the Japanese yen--pairing with the rupee.

  On the charts, an OIL India, how does it look?
  
  Most PSU oil stocks are in some kind of downtrends. OIL India is more sideways type stock. Generally it does lower volumes. It finds support around 1200, resistance around 1420-1425. Over the last 3-4 months, this is what it has done, so chances are it should remain within this range, 1200-1400.

Oil marketing companies to procure Rs 97-crore litre ethanol,"{""Oil marketing companies"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/oil-marketing-companies-to-procure-rs-97-crore-litre-ethanol/articleshow/45684763.cms,m.economictimes.com,Oil marketing companies to procure Rs 97-crore litre ethanol,"PUNE: The expression of interest (EoI) floated by the oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Monday to procure 97 crore litre of ethanol at Rs 42 a litre ex-mill is expected to give a big relief to the cash crunched sugar industry in the country. 

 The industry is also expecting that the Union government may come out with the decision about extending export incentives any time, which will help the industry deal with surplus sugar and avoid distress sugar sale as well as pay the mandatory fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugar cane. 

 Almost 70% of the sugar mills in Maharashtra have received legal notices from the sugar commissioner for non-payment of the FRP within the stipulated 15 day period after cane delivery to the mill. ""We have sent legal notices for non-payment of FRP to 119 mills under the Sugarcane Control Order,"" said Vipin Sharma, commissioner of sugar, Maharashtra. Barring a few exceptions, almost all the mills in Maharashtra are paying less than the FRP. Rajendra Girme, chairman and managing director of Sasvad Mali sugar mill said: ""We have given a written reply to the notice sent to us stating that we will be able to pay the FRP only if we get government assistance"". Some of the sugar mills in largest sugar producer Maharashtra had done advance sale of sugar at distress price. 

 Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said: ""There is no need for the sugar mills to go in for distress sale because about 1.5 million tonne to 2 million tonne of excess sugar will be taken care by the Centre's export incentives scheme. The OMCs have come out with EoI to purchase ethanol at Rs 42 per litre at factory gate. This is adequate to incentivise conversion of surplus sugar by some distilleries into ethanol to take care of the surplus sugar."" 

 During the tenure of the earlier government, sugar mills were getting Rs 3,300 tonne assistance for sugar exports. Now, the mills are expecting to get Rs 4,000tonne assistance as international prices have declined further. 

 As the sugarcane crushing in the country is in full swing, India is poised to have a fifth consecutive year of surplus sugar production.Maharashtra has already crushed 250 lakh tonne sugar and another 550 lakh tonne remains to be crushed. 

 The crushing is likely to continue even till MayJune in districts like Solapur and Pune where the area under cane increased substantially last year.

 ""The PE funds are discussing the term sheets with the promoters,"" an investment banker said, adding that the ""deal could be for about Rs 200 crore and is expected to close by January"". The Dodsal group is being advised by Investment bank Euromax Capital. 

 ET had reported earlier that the group plans to carve out its food business and sell it to a PE fund. It is, however, unclear if the group will retain a small stake in the company after the sale, one of the persons quoted earlier said. IVFA denied being in talks with Dodsal. ""We are not in any discussions with Dodsal or with anyone else for Pizza Hut or any other pizza business,"" Vishal Nevatia, managing partner and chief executive of IVFA, said in an email reply. 

 Spokespersons for the Rajen Dodsal Group and Multiples did not respond to ET’s queries on the matter. The Kilachand family, the owners of Dodsal, wants to focus on its engineering and construction business in the Middle East, and exit the quick-service food business which it operates with 86 retail restaurants.Pizza Hut, KFC and Tacobel are three flagship brands of USbased Yum! International. 

 Dodsal owns the franchise rights to the Pizza Hut outlets in south and west India and runs six KFC quick-service restaurants in Mumbai and Bangalore. The Pizza Hut chain in north and east India is run by Ravi Jaipuria-owned Devyani International. This is the Dodsal group’s second attempt at selling stake in its retail chain business. 

 In 2009, the promoters were close to selling between 30% and 40% to private equity fund New Silk Route, but the deal fell through on valuation mismatches. The company is now valued at about 10 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or operating profit. 

 The Dodsal group diversified into the food service industry in 1997. In addition to 23 restaurants in Bangalore and 20 in Mumbai, Dodsal Enterprises Pvt Ltd also owns Pizza Hut chains in Gujarat, Pune, Nasik, Vizag, Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Vijayawada, Mysore, Manipal and Mangalore. PE funds have been investing in India’s fine dining restaurants. 

 For instance, PE fund Jacob Ballas has purchased a stake in Devyani International, SAIF Partners in Mainland China, New Silk Route in Adigas and Moshe's and CX Partners in Barbecue Nation.

I think this is the one stock which you can buy, we have a price target initially from a trading point of view of about Rs 98 but then from a investment point of view if you can hold on for about six to eight months I think this stock can easily go to levels of about Rs 120-125.

Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to retest its crucial psychological level of 8,100 in trade today. 

 At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 3.50 points lower at 8,128.50 indicating flat opening on the domestic market. 

 Nifty ended the day with a loss of 58 points at 8094, while Sensex closed with losses of over 200 points at 27057.41 on Wednesday. 

 ""In the immediate term the level of 8040 would continue to serve as an important support for the index. Whether or not this support is respected in next few sessions will decide the future course of action,"" GEPL Capital said in a report. 

 ""A respect of this support would indicate a bounce back till 8130 - 8150 range whereas if it is breached, then it would mean further sign of weakness which may take the Index may down to 7980 - 7980 range,"" added the report. 

 The brokerage firm is of the view that the level of 7920 is the level below which Nifty may face additional selling pressure. The index appears highly overstretched on the upside and we recommend a trailing stop loss of 8040 for all long positions. 

 With mixed signals on the domestic and international front, the Nifty should consolidate between 8040-8250 levels in near future before any breakout on either side, say analysts. 

 ""In such markets, traders should maintain a stock specific approach while keeping limited positions,"" said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited.

Excerpts: 

 
ET Now: Your thoughts on FMCG? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: When I say FMCG may not mean only the FMCG companies it may also mean stuff that tier 2 towns and villages consume so insecticide, pesticide companies are something that we are glued on, seed companies are something that we are glued on also. FMCG companies which have pricing power so as of now in the market every FMCG company is moving up but not all categories have pricing power. 

 
ET Now: Within the FMCG sector where should one lean, should one buy into classic defensives like HUL or ITC or it is now time to really go down the ladder, look at a Dabur, look at a Marico, it is time to revisit to Colgate or may be addin a Britannia? 

 
Prateek Agarwal: I will give you the broad contours of our thought process. We do not like single product FMCG companies. We like ones with a basket of brands. So when if you are talking derisking then if you have a single product led company that adds an element of risk whatever may be the markets share. We like companies with strong brands and pricing power. 

 You may have a strong position in the market but you may still not have pricing power. So that is something else to be kept in mind. Valuations across the board in FMCG leave very little to any kind of accidents. They are really stretched, to some extent I would want to believe that the money which have come back from HUL buyback is going to the same space again so may be it make sense to wait out a bit and let the stock settle. In vast majority of the FMCG stocks valuations are peakish.

 Total income during the period rose to Rs 1,389 crore mainly due to higher revenue from cement and TBK businesses, as against Rs 1,134 crore in the year-ago quarter. It sold 15.39 lakh tonnes cement and clicker during the June quarter, generating Rs 600 crore sales. 

 ""The margins of the cement division improved as compared to the corresponding quarter last year on account of cost saving measures implemented and revival of demand in the markets of interest,"" it said. 

 The Tile Bath Kitchen (TBK) segment's revenue grew by 27 per cent to Rs 490 crore due to higher capacity utilisastion. 

 The company said RMC division witnessed some early signs of recovery, but the profitability of the division continued to be under pressure due to lower capacity utilisation and increase in costs, especially fuel.

Private sector is more promising than PSU bank stocks,"{""PSU bank stocks"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/private-sector-is-more-promising-than-psu-bank-stocks/articleshow/32755588.cms,m.economictimes.com,Private sector is more promising than PSU bank stocks,"PSU bank stocks are down and out. The State Bank of India has plunged to Rs 1,741 from Rs 2,051, Canara Bank has fallen toRs245 from Rs371, and Bank of India has tumbled to Rs205 from Rs289 in a span of a year. Many PSU banks are trading below their book value. Bank of India trades at a P/BV of 0.54, while Canara Bank trades at a P/BV of 0.48. SBI is trading at a P/BV of 1.31. Despite these beaten down valuations, there are no takers for these stocks.
 
 Analysts continue to prefer private sector banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, among others, despite a spurt in stock prices and rise in valuations. Stocks of HDFC Bank have moved up to Rs750 fromRs610, Kotak Bank to Rs765 from Rs631 and ICICI Bank to Rs1,250 from Rs1,012. HDFC Bank trades at a P/BV of 4.9, while ICICI trades at a P/BV of 2.1.
 
 Analysts justify their preference for private banks by citing a host of parameters: lower NPAs, gain in market share, better disclosures and continuity in top management, and so on. “Private banks are preferred due to their high quality portfolio, aggressive management, higher transparency and focus on the retail segment,” says Sadanand Shetty, senior V-P and fund manager, Taurus Mutual Fund. Others also point towards the deteriorating financial health of state-run banks.
 
 “Due to rising bad debt, public sector banks will remain dependent on the government for capital infusion. This will dilute the book value and lead to lower returns in the long run,” says Dipen Shah, head (PCG Research), Kotak Securities
 
 Way Ahead of Competition In the last two decade, private sector banks — ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank and so on — have been gaining market share at the expense of state-run banks. For example, they have increased their current account savings account market share to 17 per cent in 2013 from 14 per cent in 2009. “The focus on retail segment has helped new private sector banks in the last five years when the economy passed through a slowdown,” says Alpesh Mehta, banking analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities.
 
 
 
 
  
 
 However, public sector banks continued to focus on the corporate loan segment in this period, which proved to be a bad strategy. “With consumption pattern changing further in favour of discretionary spending, good growth is likely in consumer loans, namely home loans, auto loans and credit cards,” says Mehta. With private sector banks eyeing growth in semi-urban and rural areas, they are likely to further eat into the existing market share of staterun banks, say analysts.
 
 Quality of management and higher disclosures are other favourable factors attracting investors towards private sector banks. “PSU bank chiefs see frequent changes, giving them very little time to execute. Compared to this, private sector banks have seen higher management continuity,” says Alok Ranjan, portfolio manager, Way2Wealth. For example, Aditya Puri and team has been leading HDFC Bank for the last 20 years. Ranjan asks investors to bet on HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank with 2-3-year horizon. “Private banks are more transparent and open than public sector banks,” says Sadanand Shetty.
 
 NPAs Continue to Drag PSU Banks According to RBI data, net NPAs of PSU banks rose to 2.02per cent in 2012-13 from 1.53per cent in the previous year. Net NPAs of private sector banks rose marginally to 0.45per cent from 0.42per cent during the same period. PSU banks have resorted to restructuring of loans to avoid bad debt. Restructured accounts have grown at a CAGR of 47.86per cent in PSU banks against 8.12per cent for private sector banks.

Pyramid Saimira case: Sebi completes probe against five entities,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/pyramid-saimira-case-sebi-completes-probe-against-five-entities/articleshow/28429091.cms,m.economictimes.com,Pyramid Saimira case: Sebi completes probe against five entities,"MUMBAI: The Sebi has brought to closure its probe against five entities involved in fraudulent trades in Pyramid Saimira shares, one of the biggest insider trading cases in Indian capital markets, even as proceedings have been initiated against the main accused Nirmal Kotecha. 

 While all five entities have been found ""facilitating, aiding and abetting principal offender Nirmal Kotecha in his nefarious securities market related activities"", the Sebi said four of them have already undergone the required debarment from the securities markets for more than four years since interim orders were issued against them. 

 As a result, the restraining order against the four, which also includes two entities indirectly controlled by Nirmal Kotecha, have been removed. 

 Passing final orders against them, the Sebi however said another entity, Nirman Management Services (presently known as Teakwood Management Services), would undergo debarment from the securities market for a period of total seven years for facilitating Kotecha in his fraudulent dealings. 

 The period of debarment already undergone by this entity since passage of Sebi's interim order of April 23, 2009 would be taken into account for this seven-year restraint order, the regulator said. 

 The Sebi also said its decision to remove restrictions from four entities is ""without prejudice to the proceedings which have been initiated vis-a-vis Nirmal Kotecha"". 

 The matters relate to one of the biggest cases of insider trading and fraudulent trade. A former promoter Nirmal Kotecha sold a huge number of shares of Pyramid Saimira Theatres in December 2008 after dissemination of false information in media based on a forged Sebi letter asking promoter PS Saminathan to make an open offer. 

 The forged Sebi letter was alleged to have been planned and executed by Kotecha himself and persons working with him. 

 Taking action in the case, the Sebi had passed interim orders against more than 200 entities, including Saminathan and Kotecha, on April 23, 2009, barring them from capital markets. 

 The four entities, including Nirmal's mother Veena Kotecha and grandfather Manilal Kotecha, were barred from the markets at that time for permitting Nirmal Kotecha to use their bank accounts for his fraudulent funding activities. 

 The Sebi probe later found that Kotecha and entities associated with him, including his friends and relatives, made significant undue profit from the publication of forged letter and the consequent trading activities, which enabled them to offload substantial holdings in shares of Pyramid Saimira. 

 In different final orders on these four, passed on January 3, the Sebi said the four-years-and-eight-month period of ban already undergone by them will ""broadly commensurate"" for the the charge of aiding and abetting Nirmal Kotecha in violating PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations. 

 In the case of Nirman Management, the Sebi said by allowing its director, Nirmal Kotecha, to use its bank account for funding activities which operated as a fraud on genuine investors, the entity had ""indeed aided and abetted Nirmal Kotecha and thus violated provisions of...the PFUTP Regulations"". 

 However, the market regulator said ""the period of prohibition already undergone by Nirman Management Services pursuant to Sebi ad interim order dated April 23, 2009 shall be taken into account for the purpose of computing seven years of prohibition imposed in this order"".

 People will start having that weightage in the or their presence in the portfolio mainly on two accounts. One, of course, is the gas price possibilities and upsides and second is the newer opportunities opening up both in oil and gas and other sectors which can give fillip to the stocks.

Pressure on refining margins and petrochemical margins would weigh the numbers. The company’s board meeting will be held on Saturday, 19th July to consider the unaudited quarterly numbers.
 
 RIL, which had posted a net profit of Rs 5352 crore for the Apr – June 2013 quarter, is expected to report a similar number for the Apr – June 2014 quarter, which will be a drop of around 5% from Rs 5631 crore posted in immediately preceding quarter of Jan – Mar 2014.
 
 Both the main businesses of the company are expected to face margin pressure during the Apr – June 2014 quarter. “We expect RIL to report GRMs of $8.6 per barrel compared to $9.3 in Jan – Mar 2014 quarter,” mentioned a report from Morgan Stanley. The Singapore complex margin declined by $0.5 per barrel QoQ to average $5.8 per barrel, while light-heavy spread at $4.8 per barrel was down marginally, it noted.
 
 The company’s petrochemical business too could witness margin pressure, while the production of natural gas is expected to stagnate. “Petrochemical EBIT is likely to be down 7% QoQ,” mentioned a preview report by Jefferies, while adding the KG basin gas production to average at 13 mmscmd as against 13.7 of Jan – Mar ’14 quarter.
 
 Any update on the company’s capacity addition programme and telecom venture will be welcome, although the results are not expected to have any impact on the company’s share price.

Reliance will participate in a bigger way: Kunj Bansal,"{""Reliance"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/reliance-will-participate-in-a-bigger-way-kunj-bansal/articleshow/33164373.cms,m.economictimes.com,Reliance will participate in a bigger way: Kunj Bansal,"ET Now: Technically a new bull market has started. Fundamentally do you think a new bull market has started? 

 
Kunj Bansal: I will put it in like this, obviously the market has been going up. We have seen significant amount of investor interest which obviously given the India’s market cap, liquidity and the depth comes largely from FIIs but that is just a segment of the market in my view. 

 Now why this interest has come in. There is a general perception that because of the political expectation of a stable government and that too by a certain particular coalition. I have slightly different thought that in my view, maybe that is not the only reason or certainly that is not the main reason, maybe that is a supportive reason. 

 What is the reason is that there has been significant improvement in the macroeconomic numbers of the country and part of that credit we have to give it to current government. Now keeping the credit and debit aside coming back to what are those macroeconomic numbers, we have clearly seen inflation significantly coming down. 

 We have clearly seen the trade deficit and current deficit coming down which is what has resulted in currency remaining strengthened to whatever it is currently in absolute terms and even compared to the other relative...
 
 
ET Now: What would lead the market higher because now there is this big debate about whether one sticks with cyclicals or should one stay put with IT, pharma, the ones which have already worked for you? 

 
Kunj Bansal: Let us again put this very briefly in some numbers. Today, currently the Nifty is 6,750 odd yesterday’s closing. Now let us take the next psychological good number as 7,000 which will be about 5 per cent rise. 

 That 5 per cent will be led by what, obviously it will have to be some high weighted Nifty stocks. So to answer your question, Reliance is the one which has already participated one but will continue to participate in a bigger way. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank participated in the initial part of the rally but have not participated in last 100-150 points from the rally. They will be the ones which will come back and Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. They are the ones who have not participated as much will be ones which will participate. 

 I somehow do not feel that Infy and TCS will be the leaders in this next round of 5-6 per cent rally of the market. 

 
ET Now: And no pharma stock also? 

 
Kunj Bansal: No, this is purely based on the momentum that is there in the market. Such a short term movement of the market in my view probably cannot be predicted or cannot be justified on the reasonings of valuations or fundamentals. 

 
ET Now: So you are saying it will be 7000 within this month? 

 
Kunj Bansal: I am not saying that. I am saying to answer your question that if the 7000 goes too, then what are the stocks which will lead the rally but still coming back, we might as well be at 7000 in next few days.

  MUMBAI: Tata Consultancy Services has beaten street results expectations on all fronts. In its post-result analysis, Kotak Securities has maintained ‘Buy’ recommendation on the stock and has revised its price target to Rs 1152 per share.
  
  
  “Management commentary reflects greater optimism, likely on the back of strong pipeline and better deal flow. TCS won 8 large deals during the quarter. Management has seen revival in discretionary spends, which is encouraging. Realizations were largely unchanged and rate increases may come in, if demand sustains, we opine.
  
  
  We make changes to our FY11 earnings estimates. FY11E earnings now stand at Rs 42 per share (v/s 40 earlier). We also introduce our FY12 estimates. EPS is expected to be Rs 47.7 in FY12, after considering higher tax rates for the fiscal.
  
  
  We revise our price target to Rs 1152 (Rs 918 earlier) based on FY12 estimates, after according valuations similar to Infosys, noting the improved demand scenario, out-performance on revenue growth and the company's ability to restrict impact on margins.
  
  
  We maintain a BUY. A sharp appreciation in the rupee against various currencies and a delay in recovery in major user economies remain the key risks to our call,” the report said.

Rice bran oil set to smoke out olive oil,"{""Rice bran oil"": ""positive"", ""olive oil"": ""negative""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/commodities/rice-bran-oil-set-to-smoke-out-olive-oil/articleshow/19718424.cms,m.economictimes.com,Rice bran oil set to smoke out olive oil,"You can just forget about cooking with olive oil to stay fit. Olive oil production in Spain has been hit hard by a drought, which has pushed up prices by 40%. This has prompted rice bran oil companies like Adani Wilmar, Ricela Health Food and Sethia Oils to swing into action to take a slice of this market, which largely comprises the urban youth. These oil companies are organising health workshops in office premises to push their products that are much cheaper than olive oil but have the same health values. 

 The companies are planning to scale up the rice bran oil production to ensure a continuous supply in the market. Anghsu Mallick, chief operating officer of Adani Wilmar, told ET: “We have launched Fortune rice bran oil that has been well accepted in the market. Our customers are largely the urban young people. They generally prefer light cooking oil like olive oil. 

 But this year, there has been a shortage of olive crop in Spain and this has pushed up prices. We are trying to capture this market as rice bran oil is also a light cooking medium and has similar health values.” 

 Total production of olive oil for five months since October 2012 was 5,96,000 tonne — 62% down compared to the same period last season, according to the latest market report from Spain’s Olive Oil Agency. The next harvest outlook is also not very bright as heavy rains this month have increased the occurrence of olive leaf spot, which could reduce production. 

 In 2011-2012, imports grew to 7,163 tonne, registering a growth of 42%. European olive oils continue to dominate imports with about 85%, of which 48% came from Spain and 36% from Italy. 

 Priyanshi Patel, VP (international business) of NK Proteins, said: “According to data available, we can see that from last year, there is a 40% price rise in olive oil that has factored in the current drought. From June-end, we should expect a revision of rates.” 

 But that is not stopping rice bran oil companies to use every opportunity to push their product. Mallick said: “We are organising health workshops at IT companies and housing societies in Mumbai and Delhi to create an awareness about rice bran oil. 

 In fact, we have appointed dieticians to explain the benefits of rice bran oil to the urban youth. We now produce 30,000 tonne of edible oil but we will shortly sca le it up to 40,000 tonne per annum.” AR Sharma, chairman of largest rice bran oil company Ricela Health Food, said: “There is a huge potential for rice bran oil. 

 Now, only 9 lakh tonne is produced though it can go up to 15 lakh tonne. Of the 9 lakh tonne, only 2 lakh tonne is available in the market in packed form.”

Sudip Bandyopadhyay: It is a landmark thing the way the currency has appreciated over the last few days but one must remember it is culmination of two-three factors. One is lot of money is being brought in by the FIIs, two is we had this Axis Bank sale by SUUTI and lot of foreign money did come in through that route as well that was quite a chunk. We also have seen inflows into Indian debt consistently. So combination of these three factors led to lot of dollar moving into India and to an extent RBI has been trying to slowdown the pace but the dollar flow was too much for them to handle and we have a currency which has appreciated so sharply. I would not say this is very healthy and I would not say this is sustainable. We believe that at some stage we will see the correction and rupee will probably stabilised around 61-62 levels.

  Rel Comm, what would you do with this one. It has bounced up a big 173 would you initiate any trade on this one? 
  
  RComm is actually giving some positive signals around 2009 bottom like it has been taking a very good support and particularly all the telecom companies are taking support and they are bouncing back. I think this telecom sector the big issue is that I don’t think there is a much downside from here they are going to perform better than the other stock which have been doing well till now and these stocks have been underperforming though I wouldn’t take a buy call immediately at these level because still it’s a range bound and you can see RComm going back to 140 but at a lower level definitely one can accumulate for a very long term even other stock something like Bharti and Idea.
  
  Overall I feel this is a neutral stock and below 165 it will have some kind of a negative bias for the short term and right now I feel like one should hold it if somebody is holding it for a long term portfolio and for a short term traders one can keep a stop loss below 165 closing basis and can hold this stock for little more bounce but I feel overall the scenario seems to be a range bound for these stocks.

The Sebi board, which met in Delhi on Thursday, also made it mandatory for companies to disclose CEO compensation.
 
 Further, Sebi recommended tax incentives for mutual funds and proposed that the Employee Provident Fund Organisation should invest 15% of its corpus in equities and MF schemes. It announced higher net worth need for asset management companies, apparently aimed at weeding out smaller funds.
 
 The new rules restrict the tenure of independent directors to two five-year terms. Directors nominated by the company's promoter cannot be classified as an independent director, Sebi said.
 
 Companies will now have to disclose remuneration policies of CEOs and executive directors, related-party transactions and appointment and resignations of independent directors.
 
 These rules are aimed at aligning corporate governance norms to best global practices and to the new Companies Act of 2013, said Sebi chairman UK Sinha. ""We have decided that there will be a compensation committee that has to be headed by an independent director. The committee will first (have to) put in place a remuneration policy and it will be fixing the remuneration of key managerial persons.
 
 We have concentrated on the process of fixing remuneration,"" Sinha told reporters in Delhi after the board meeting. ""Sebi's new norms to be effective October 1, 2014 are in the right direction and go a long way to change the corporate governance paradigm. The norms empower minority shareholders to be more informed and to easily exercise their votes,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director, InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm.
 
 Sebi said, in case a person is a whole time director in a listed company, then he can only be on three boards. ""If somebody has already been independent director for more than five years, then he can get only one extra term of five years,"" Sinha said. The regulator has also made it mandatory for companies to have an orderly succession plan for appointments to the board and senior management, a whistle blowing policy and to appoint at least one woman director on its board, besides empowering minority shareholders to approve related-party transactions.
 
 Some of these changes may attract criticism. Recently, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had criticised any move to cap the number of board memberships for independent directors, saying there is a paucity of directors.
 
 MF Policy The Sebi board also announced higher net worth requirements for asset management companies. ""The minimum capital requirement for an asset management company has been increased from Rs 10 crore to Rs 50 crore.
 
 ""There are 19 companies today who have less than Rs 50 crore of capital and a share of 6% in total assets under management. They have been given a time frame of three years to reach that particular level,"" Sinha said.
 
 ""Increasing the net worth requirement for mutual funds is not a good idea because you need smart managers to manage the portfolios and not the rich managers,"" said Sandeep Parekh, founder, Finsec Law Advisor.
 
 ""The Rs 50-crore net worth criteria is a negative step as this does not guarantee greater financial inclusion or seriousness. Only larger players will dominate the market, which is not good for retail investors,"" said Jimmy Patel, CEO, Quantum AMC.
 
 Sebi also proposed that EPFO, a government body which manages savings of employees in the organised sector, should be allowed to invest up to 15% of its corpus in equities and mutual funds. Further, members of EPFO who are earning more thanRs 6,500 a month should be given an option that a part of their corpus could be invested in a MF product. The regulator has also proposed tax incentives for equity mutual funds.
 
 To encourage MFs to participate in corporate governance of the investee companies and exercise their voting rights, the regulator has ordered fund houses to disclose voting data along with rationale supporting their decision (for, against or abstain) on a quarterly basis on their website.

Sebi collates KYC details of nearly two crore investors,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-collates-kyc-details-of-nearly-two-crore-investors/articleshow/30722972.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi collates KYC details of nearly two crore investors,"NEW DELHI: As government prepares to set up a central Know Your Client system for entire financial sector, details of close to 2 crore investors have been collated on a centralised database for various segments of capital markets. 

 In his interim budget speech, Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the government plans to ""create one record for all financial assets of every individual"". 

 The move is expected to help ease doing business for individuals as well as financial sector entities, including banks, insurers, mutual funds, brokers and others. 

 Following directions from capital markets regulator Sebi, a centralised KYC database has already been set up for all segments under its jurisdiction ,including mutual funds and brokerage firms. 

 Now, Sebi has cleared a proposal to allow market intermediaries to access investor details from these agencies, rather than carry out a fresh KYC verification procedure. 

 According to latest data available with Sebi, as many as 1.87 crore investors have provided KYC details to five KRAs (KYC Registration Agencies) registered with the market regulator at the end of December 2013. 

 ""KRA system has been working smoothly and with inter-operability, there is easy exchange of KYC data among 5 Sebi registered KRAs,"" Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said. 

 ""As the system has stabilised and large number of clients have on-boarded into the KRA system, it is felt that there may not be a need to provide an option to the intermediary to seek documents already available on the KRA system from a KYC compliant client,"" it added. 

 Presently, market entities such as brokers and mutual funds have the option to either access the client information available with KRAs or carry out fresh KYC process. 

 However, Sebi observed that the option of taking fresh KYCs was provided in the regulations ""to ensure that intermediaries equip themselves to the concept of KRA system, as the new system was expected to stabilise in due course"". 

 The concept of the KRA system is been replicated by the Ministry of Finance which is working towards establishing a Central KYC system for the entire financial sector. 

 CDSL Ventures Limited (CVL), NSDL Database Management Limited (NDML), DotEx International Limited (DotEx), CAMS Investor Services and Karvy Data Management Services are the Sebi registered KRAs. 

 In course of time, the government intends to have one KYC norm across all financial sector regulators - including those for the banking, capital market, insurance and pension sectors.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has found hundreds of entities to have devised such unauthorised schemes to launder black money and evade taxes and is currently probing many other such cases.
 
 
While Sebi has taken interim action against these entities by barring them from the markets, it has also suggested further probe by other agencies for tax evasion and other irregularities, a senior official said.
 
 
In its meeting last week, Sebi's board was apprised of the surveillance action taken in this regard, which included interim orders passed in two such cases involving illicit tax-free gains running into hundreds of crores of rupees.
 
 
In the first order, Sebi barred Mishka Finance, its 6 promoters, 4 directors and 170 other entities from accessing securities market and prohibited them from buying, selling or dealing in securities till further directions.
 
 
Sebi had suo motu carried an examination after noticing an exorbitant rise in trading volume and share price of Mishka.
 
 
It was found that the company along with its promoters and directors issued new shares through preferential allotment to certain entities. Further, the promoters transferred their holding in physical form to related entities, while price of the scrip increased astronomically despite low volumes.
 
 
One month after share split, the preferential allottees and promoter related entities started selling the shares to entities related to Mishka, thereby making huge profits.
 
 
""It appears that the stock market mechanism was used by the company, its promoters and related entities for booking Long-Term Capital Gains of Rs 254 crore approximately and converting their unaccounted income into accounted one.
 
 
""These connected entities are offloading these shares by indulging in trading in an artificial, manipulative and unfair manner,"" Sebi said.
 
 
In the second case, Sebi restrained Pine Animation group, their promoters and related entities, their directors along with their preferential allottee and exit providers (total of 178 entities) from markets till further directions.
 
 
Sebi said the typical modus operandi of allotting shares on a preferential basis, announcing a stock split and then bringing in connected entities to provide exit was a scheme devised to make ill-gotten gains.
 
 
It included pumping the share price artificially and then dumping the price so that the same cycle could be repeated.
 
 
""Also the mechanism is presumably being used to deceive the authorities by laundering black money and making tax-free profits. Further, the order mentions that the issue requires further investigation from the forensic angle,"" Sebi said.

 The proposed norms are likely to be discussed by Sebi's board soon, sources said. 

 The regulator may first issue draft regulations, on which comments would be sought from all stakeholders before deciding the final norms. 

 The proposed new regime would also require other regulatory changes, including by RBI and the Tax Department, sources added. 

 This would be on the lines of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trust) and InViTs (Infrastructure Investment Trust). 

 Bond and other securities based on renewable energy are also under Sebi's consideration. 

 A 'YieldCo' is a publicly listed company that is formed to own assets that generate a predictable cash flow, primarily through long-term contracts. 

 In this model, the cost of capital is lowered by separation of volatile assets like development, research and construction. 

 The model, which has already been gaining ground in the US and some other markets, is used in the renewable energy sector to protect the investors against regulatory changes. 

 Under this model, the investors get the annual returns like a dividend and the capital remains invested for the long term. 

 Besides, there are tax incentives to make this model attractive. 

 In the past couple of years, billions of dollars have been raised by American and European companies through IPOs of YieldCos, which are first spun off from their main business and then get listed separately. 

 According to a USIBC report, there may be opportunities to explore the YieldCo dividend model specifically for Indian smart cities.

 Further, the market watchdog has suggested that any other entity registered with Sebi and having a minimum networth of Rs 500 crore may also be considered as a QIB. 

 At present, QIBs are defined under Sebi regulations as those institutional investors, who are generally perceived to possess expertise and the financial muscle to evaluate and invest in capital markets. 

 The existing QIBs include public financial institutions like scheduled commercial banks, mutual funds, foreign institutional investor and venture capital funds. 

 In a new proposal, Sebi has said that the definition of QIBs ""may be extended to include systematically important NBFCs as per RBI guidelines and family offices/ trusts, subject to such family offices/trust registering itself as Alternate Investment Funds (AIF)."" 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought public comments till April 20 for this proposal, which is part of a draft paper on setting up an Alternate Capital Raising platform for start-ups. 

 The move is aimed at helping such companies raise funds from within India and stop their flight to overseas markets. 

 Under the proposed alternate capital raising platform, money should be raised only from institutions and high networth individuals by the new-age companies having innovative business model and belonging to knowledge-based technology sector. However, retail investors would be restricted from investing in such companies. 

 The regulator came out with this proposal after taking into account suggestions made by Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC) of Sebi. 

 The proposals on QIB would be applicable to all issuers irrespective of the listing on main board or the institutional platform.

Sebi to revisit policy on proprietary trading by brokers,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-to-revisit-policy-on-proprietary-trading-by-brokers/articleshow/29045809.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi to revisit policy on proprietary trading by brokers,"NEW DELHI: To ring-fence small investors from any manipulation by brokers, market regulator Sebi is considering revisiting its policy on proprietary trades. 

 Such trades are conducted by brokers for their own gains and not for the clients. 

 Brokers are required to make strict disclosures about their proprietary trades and ensure a 'Chinese Wall' like structure between these trading activities and the trades conducted by them on behalf of their clients. 

 However, many cases have come to fore in the recent past where some brokers were found indulging in manipulative activities involving their proprietary trades, while in certain cases, clients' money has been misused for their own trading interest as well, officials said. 

 Cases like the NSEL crisis have also revealed possible manipulations by brokers and Sebi has therefore decided to revisit its policy on proprietary trades, they added. 

 In proprietary trading, brokerage firms trade in stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, among others, with their own fund rather than customers' money, in order to make a profit for itself. 

 Besides safeguarding the overall market-place from any manipulation by brokers, the new policy would also look to further ring-fence clients' money from any utilisation for proprietary trading by brokerage firms, officials said. 

 Revising the policy for proprietary trades is one of the key focus areas in secondary market for Sebi this year. 

 During the last fiscal, Sebi inspected more than 200 stock brokers and sub-brokers to check any possible non-compliance of norms to check money laundering and terror funding through capital markets. 

 This marked a significant jump from a total of 81 brokers and sub-brokers on whom such inspections were carried out during the previous fiscal 2011-12. 

 These inspections focussed on compliance of norms regarding anti-money laundering, settlement of accounts of clients on a timely basis, segregation of clients and proprietary funds/securities and KYC norms. 

 Sebi has been taking various steps to prevent money laundering and terror-financing through securities markets. 

 According to Sebi, rapid developments and greater integration of the financial markets, together with improvements in technology and communication channels, continue to pose serious challenges to the authorities and institutions dealing with anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). 

 Sebi has included AML/CFT risks as part of its inspection of market intermediaries such as stock brokers, depository participants and mutual funds. 

 During 2012-13, Sebi had carried out 40 special purpose inspections of stock brokers to check their compliance with the AML/CFT framework. 

 Further, 35 inspections of stock brokers and six depository participants focusing on compliance with KYC norms were carried out in 2012-13.

 Among others, the Department is also formulating a plan of action for tackling the menace of companies existing on paper only, while stringent actions are underway against those violating the Listing Agreement by making inadequate disclosure of price sensitive information. 

 Besides, the regulator is also considering possible action like freezing of promoter shares in a company found to be non-compliant to the Listing Agreement and other norms. 

 Concerned about gullible investors being defrauded by certain companies existing only on paper, the capital markets watchdog is planning to conduct surprise inspections of such entities to bring them to book. 

 The typical modus-operandi of such entities involves setting up of a company, followed by tall claims about their proposed business ventures. Then an exercise is undertaken to collect funds from investors, including through IPOs (Initial Public Offers) of shares and issuance of other securities. 

 The study on 'trend or pattern discovery module' would also include the best practices followed in developed markets for surveillance of algorithmic and high frequency trading, an area which has been a matter of concern not only for India but also for many others. 

 The study is one of the major policy initiatives proposed by capital markets regulator Sebi for the current financial year, for which Sebi has identified 'capacity building' as a core focus area. 

 According to the proposed move, a comprehensive study needs to be undertaken to understand the ""trend/pattern discovery by regulators in developed markets like the US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong"" in order to keep pace with the ever increasing globalisation of Indian markets. 

 ""The study would include analysis of their surveillance infrastructure and techniques to decipher patterns in the trading, formation of associations between entities, gathering of market intelligence including linkage of price volume pattern to market information, etc,"" the official added. 

 With regard to Sebi's capacity building initiatives, an independent consultant has suggested that the regulator needs to undertake technical training, especially in areas like inspection and surveillance, on a much larger scale and the same would be pursued in the next fiscal more vigorously.

Sebi to tap social media for investor awareness campaigns,"{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-to-tap-social-media-for-investor-awareness-campaigns/articleshow/47222822.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sebi to tap social media for investor awareness campaigns,"NEW DELHI: Markets regulator Sebi has decided to tap social media and other popular internet and mobile platforms to make investors aware about their rights and to safeguard them against possible frauds. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is already using platforms like TV, radio and print newspapers for investor education and awareness programmes. It has carried out campaigns in 13 languages including English, Hindi and regional languages spoken across India. 

 In the current fiscal 2015-16, Sebi has now proposed to explore other mediums like outdoor media, advertising, as well as social media to spread investor education and awareness, as also the financial education, as per the regulator's budget proposals for this financial year. 

 Sebi is already present on Twitter through which it gives updates about the investor education and financial literacy workshops being held in different parts of the country, along with other information for the benefit of investors. 

 Sebi is now planning to expand the use of Twitter and other social media platforms in a big way. 

 ""Media planning for the campaign was undertaken keeping in mind the reach to the target audience. It is important that the messages are published, broadcast with greater frequency through repeated insertions in TV, Radio, print so these messages are appropriately visible to the target audience. 

 ""It is also needed that we may adopt the new popular media such as internet, mobile etc. Hence, it is pertinent that the expenditure on media services (broadcast/publication of advertisement) is also enhanced accordingly. 

 ""During Financial Year 2015-16 scale of campaigns undertaken through mass media will largely depend on the availability of sufficient funds for this purpose,"" Sebi said in its Budget proposals for the current fiscal. 

 Since December 2012, various campaigns have been carried out where advertisements were broadcast or published on TV, Radio and Print media on topics such as 'Grievance Redress Mechanism' and 'Collective Investment Scheme', covering pan India (in 13 languages) through over 40,000 TVC spots, over 88,000 Radio Spots, and 600 print editions. 

 In March this year, Sebi also launched a major SMS campaign to create awareness among the public about fraudulent schemes claiming 'big profits in less time'. 

 In the last fiscal, Sebi busted more than 150 cases of frauds against gullible investors involving close to Rs 13,000 crore. It has been noticed that fraudsters are also using SMS route to lure gullible investors with promise of returns. 

 In its SMS campaign, Sebi is specially targeting the schemes where investors are promised doubling of their investments within a few months, or guaranteed fixed returns for life after investing some thousands or lakhs of rupees. 

 Besides, Sebi is continuing its investor education and awareness programmes through newspapers. One such campaign says ""high return in less time means more trouble"" and cautions against promises of investors being made ""millionaire overnight"".

"Sebi wants young, high-earning worker pension money in MFs","{""Sebi"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/sebi-wants-young-high-earning-workers-pension-money-in-mfs/articleshow/30723961.cms,m.economictimes.com,"Sebi wants young, high-earning workers' pension money in MFs","NEW DELHI: Market regulator Sebi has pitched for a part of money lying in employee pension funds to be invested in mutual fund schemes for investors aged below 40-45 years and those earning over Rs 6,500 per month. 

 While looking to give a boost to the mutual fund sector with some contribution from about Rs 5.5 lakh crore corpus being managed by EPFO (Employee Provident Fund Organisation), Sebi feels that age restrictions would safeguard investors from ""unnecessary risks"" during years closer to their retirement. 

 At the same time, income-related restrictions would also help keep the low-income employees away from the potential risks associated with capital markets, which has been a major roadblock in pension money being invested in high-risk assets. 

 Under the new long-term mutual fund policy being finalised by Sebi, the regulator will soon ask the government to pave way for a part of EPFO corpus being invested in MF schemes. The policy has been approved by the Sebi board and would soon be notified. 

 Finance Ministry had permitted EPFO way back in 2008 to invest up to 15 per cent of its corpus in shares or equity linked schemes of mutual funds. However, due to probable risk aversion on part of the trustees of EPFO, investment in equity-oriented mutual funds is not being made currently. 

 Further, Labour Ministry last year superseded an earlier decision and specifically stated that no investment is allowed in equity and equity-focussed MF schemes. 

 Sebi has now suggested change in this Labour Ministry circular to allow EPFO to invest up to 15 per cent of their corpus in equities and mutual funds. The move would help in channelising retirement money into mutual fund space. 

 It is mandatory to have employee provident fund schemes for all workers earning up to Rs 6,500 per month. Sebi, however, said that a majority of contribution in EPFO corpus comes from high-end workers for tax benefits and assured returns. 

 ""It should now be suggested that at the choice of the employee/member, contributions to such provident fund programmes can now be offered an option for a part of their corpus to be invested in a Mutual Fund product of the choice of such member/employee,"" says Sebi proposal. 

 Sebi has said that EPFO can approve specific schemes based on their track record and other parameters to be eligible for such investments, which such facilities can be restricted to the workers in a prescribed age group, which can be 25-40 years or 25-45 years. 

 Also, the amount of such allocation to MF schemes can be restricted to 20-25 per cent of worker's contribution, Sebi said, adding that a similar practice is there in the US. 

 ""Such restrictions will ensure that members of EPFO do not take unnecessary risks during their years closer to retirement,"" Sebi said. 

 The total corpus available with EPFO was about Rs 5.46 lakh crore at the end of fiscal 2011-12. The annual incremental inflows consisting of fresh inflows, maturity and interest payments accruing to fund is about Rs 80,000 crore. 

 Sebi said a potential investment of 15 per cent of EPFO corpus in equities and mutual funds would lead to substantial inflows into the markets. 

 Even if a small portion, say 5 per cent, is diverted towards equity mutual funds, it may result in new inflows of about Rs 27,300 crore from the existing corpus and Rs 4,000 crore annually from fresh contribution to EPFO, Sebi says. 

 The EPFO, whose corpus comprises contribution by the employee/member as well as his employer, has so far preferred to invest in government bonds rather than equities to avoid any potential risks to the capital. 

 Any suggestion for retirement fund of salaried employees to be invested in equities is usually met with strong opposition from trade unions and political parties. 

 Over 44 per cent of households in the US are estimated to have their savings in mutual funds, while the same figure in India stands at a mere 2.5 per cent.

Sectors that are likely to outperform in Samvat 2071,"{""Samvat 2071"": ""neutral""}",https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sectors-that-are-likely-to-outperform-in-samvat-2071/articleshow/44924338.cms,m.economictimes.com,Sectors that are likely to outperform in Samvat 2071,"MUMBAI: The Indian markets gave good gains in Samvat 2070 with defensives such as pharmaceuticals and technology leading the rally.
 
 There was some upmove in the cyclicals after the new government was formed at the centre but it petered out after disappointing performance in April-June quarter.
 
 However, pharmaceuticals led from the front and the BSE Healthcare Index surged 42 per cent since last Diwali. The rally was triggered by earnings upgrade. According to analysts, M&A activities in pharmaceuticals companies are positive for sector.
 
 The rally in pharmaceutical space is likely to continue in Samvat 2071 as most market experts remain bullish on the sector.
 
 ""In relation to corporate governance, in relation to quality, in relation to cash generation, in relation to stability of the business considering that the rupee is between 60-62 per dollar, some of our favourite (pharma) companies are still trading at 18-22 times one year forward earnings,"" said Madhu Kela, Chief Investment Strategist, Reliance Capital.
 
 ""Extraordinary money was made in the pharmaceutical sector in the last five years and we have had a few big multi-baggers in the sector. One should not expect that performance to get repeated over the next five years, but pharma will be able to give close to the index return over the next two years at least,"" he added.
 
 Most experts are of the view that cyclicals, financials and pharma will be the sectors to watch out for in Samvat 2071.
 
 ""We are working on the hypothesis that India's growth, which had slowed down significantly over the last four-five years, is going to come back on stream. The sectors obviously have to be linked to that, which is the domestic growth. So, financials, good quality capital goods, engineering, that would be the obvious choices,"" said Sunil Singhania, CIO Equity, Reliance Mutual Fund.
 
 ""There are a lot of export-oriented sectors and that again comes back to the Make in India export focussed kind of a theme wherein IT will do well, chemicals are doing well, pharma will do well, and some engineering auto ancillaries will do well,"" Singhania added.
 
 In an ET Now poll, 50 per cent analysts expect cyclicals to outperform the market. 34 per cent expect interest rate sensitives to lead, 8 per cent see defensives to gain and 8 per cent are bullish on midcaps.
 
 Raamdeo Agrawal, Managing Director & Co Founder, MOFSL is of the view that auto and auto ancillary stocks are in a sweet spot.
 
 ""You are in an amazing situation, whether it is Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Telco, Mahindra or Eicher Motors. The best of the auto boom is ahead, you just see the sales which have happened on Dhanteras Day. Sale of two lakh units against one lakh last year is staggering,"" he told ET Now.
 
 ""When this kind of news flow comes, it takes a two or three quarters for the market to absorb. Now earnings expectations will be built for December and then you see on the earnings day, you will find that stock is up 13-15 per cent. From here on, we are going to see some interesting time in auto pack for next five years,"" he added.

 While the panel, headed by Cabinet Secretary, will continue to have Economic Affairs Secretary, the provision of the Finance Minister nominating up to two persons as members has been done away with. 

 Members of the revamped panel will accordingly include Additional Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Economic Affairs Secretary and three experts of repute (who are to be nominated by the central government from a panel of experts in the fields of finance, economics, law, public administration, financial markets and other related subjects maintained by it), an official order said. 

 Earlier, the Committee did not have any member from the PMO, while there were two experts nominated by the Centre. The earlier rules also provided for appointment on the panel of ""other person, if any, not exceeding two, as the Minister of Finance may nominate"". 

 In case of selection of Whole Time Members for Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India), the Chairman of the regulatory body would continue to remain on the panel. 

 ""The Chairman and every whole time Member shall be appointed by the central government on the recommendation of a search-cum-selection Committee,"" said the latest order, which modifies 23-year-old rules in this regard. 

 The move to amend Sebi (Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairman and Members) Rules, 1992, assumes significance as the government has already begun the search for a new Chairman of Sebi to succeed the incumbent U K Sinha, whose current tenure is scheduled to end on February 17, 2016. 

 Sinha, a 1976 batch IAS officer of Bihar cadre, assumed office as the Sebi chairman on February 18, 2011 when previous UPA government was in the power. While Sinha was initially appointed with a three-year term, he was later given a two-year extension.

	“The Nifty is currently retracing the fall from 6355 to 5933 and is currently trading near the 20- and 40-daily moving averages, which should act as crucial resistances,” he added.


	Mehta is of the view that the short term bias for the index is negative for a target of 5930 with reversal at 6150.

ET Now: The coal pool pricing happening today and there is a sentiment we are seeing but more importantly on some of the power companies assuming that what is being expected or anticipated does come about how do you view the impact on these companies? 

 
P Phani Sekhar: The impact will be more pronounced on those projects which have been stuck and that is explained by the enthusiasm that you see in the ADAG pack or for that matter something like a Tata Power. For the existing projects the impact if at all can only be negative for a large number of projects which are getting coal directly from Coal India but for a project that have been stuck like Reliance Powers Krishnapatnam etc. or in Sasan then those projects has to be positive but more importantly it signals the way forward out of the deadlock that we got into. 

 It is more of a macro positive and some sentimental impact is inevitable. So from the coal price pooling you may not see any great impact immediately in the numbers but more of a sentimental aftershock I would say.
